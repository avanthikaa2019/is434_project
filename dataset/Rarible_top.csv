Rarible,üåï Safemoon-AVAX üöÄ | Launchpad in Development | Heavy Marketing | $10K Giveaway Live,"



The token launched only a few days ago and went from a 10k Market Cap to over 3 million. Seeing the rapid growth of the token inspired us to further explore our vision. We wanted to combine the two main focuses we had for this project. Facilitating the growth of the C-Chain by:

1) Driving traffic to the AVAX network

2) Providing that traffic with a project that is safe with a team that they can believe in

The success of the launch was a clear indicator to us that, with the backing that we have already received, it was our responsibility to now maximize the utility of this token. The only logical path from here that will maximize the utility of this token, and also directly correlate with our vision for is to create an IDO Launchpad.

In doing so, we will directly be participating in providing a platform and gateway for more legitimate Avalanche C-Chain projects. We have been in this space long enough to know what we are doing, and are incredibly keen on seeing AVAX explode in terms of growth and along with it, provide those joining the network an ability to be a part of the C-Chain‚Äôs best projects.

Rarible,"Today | 7-9pm UTC | $BINGUS x $DOGIRA charity NFT auction on Rarible | featuring a commissioned NFT of: Cr1tiKal, Anthomnia, Michael Rainey Jr, Bbno$, Crispy Concords and Rocky Kanaka, plus a bonus NFT.","So $Bingus teamed up with $Dogira to do a charity NFT auction and it is happening [**today**](https://i.imgur.com/NR5B7aZ.jpg) over on Rarible
Dogira just announced it: https://twitter.com/DogiraOfficial/status/1400346154999566340

The two crypto cat-dog favourites aim to raise a considerable amount of money for animal charities by auctioning off some unique, limited edition, specially commissioned NFTs. Considering the fan base these guys have, and the quality of the NFTs being made, this could get massive engagement, and the money raised might even make the news!

A previous auction that Dogira did with Vira-lata raised $50,000 for animal charities in Brazil. The combination of Dogira‚Äôs background in NFT marketing and Bingus‚Äô influencer list and amazing selection of NFTs, this could really do very well indeed. All the money is going to charity!

Right now, Bingus has found a floor during the market massacre. With coins ditching and rugging left, right and centre, Bingus stands strong and keeps working even when the market tethers up. This is a great entry point for Bingus (BSC) AND Dogira (ETH).

- - - -

**How to participate**
==============
Event will go live June 3rd between 7PM-9PM UTC on @rariblecom
Under the profile https://rarible.com/rootpew

Oh, yeah, rootpew was a Dogecoin dev and is now Dogira lead dev.

- - - -

**Tokenomics**
==============

*3% slippage is needed* (Bogged, ApeSwap, SnowgeSwap, PancakeSwap v1 (NOT V2), Hotbit, Probit)

1% to charity,  1% burned, 1% sent to $Bingus holders

Holders: *17,981*

Market Cap: $2.8m (at time of post)

Rarible,Your NFT is invisible if you're not verified,"I wanted to mention this because I think a lot of artists here might be completely unaware of this.

If your account is not verified then it means people searching your name or artwork won't find anything through Rarible. Even if your art or name is completely unique it's not just a case of being dropped to the bottom of search. In other words, you're basically invisible unless they follow a link from social media.

I think it's good to be aware of this especially if you're a professional or produce high production works but rely very little on social media presence. 

If you agree this is an issue and haven't been verified, Imo a better strategy might be to use a different platform (where you're discoverable) initially until you have a decent social following, then start minting on rarible. Otherwise you're putting in a lot of effort and money into a platfrom that isn't displaying your work.",mbtvgm,2021-03-24 01:09:27,SuperOrganizm,[],/r/Rarible/comments/mbtvgm/your_nft_is_invisible_if_youre_not_verified/,76,0,94,76,2,mbtvgm,post

Bit shady. Still hoping to sell my art and willing to stick with Rarible should I successful sell my piece.

Rarible,,Also if you find a link on Twitter of art that you like and you go to buy it or  heart it...you will be redirected to your wallet. Once connected you are not directed back to the artist or the item you went there for. You are redirected to the homepage. Very frustrating. Much hard work towards exposure and Many sales are being lost. I‚Äôve tried contacting them via Twitter. People need to bring this to their attention. Unacceptable especially if you can‚Äôt be found through a search either. Wtf. This feels like a shady combo of circumstances to flow traffic a certain way.

Rarible,Charity Sale | DOGIRA + REAU NFTs Partnership on Rarible!,"Hi everyone!

I'm here to shill this beautiful partnership between two cryptodoggos - **REAU & Dogira** ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Rootpew has made 4 beautiful 3D animated NFT collections on Rarible, for 0.25ETH each.**

**Check this out:**  
[https://rarible.com/dogirareau](https://rarible.com/dogirareau)

84% of the sales are going to REAU charity funds, which will directly help thousands of abandoned animals shelters and NGOs across Latin America. 6% is goin to REAU's development funds, and 10% to the artist.

&#x200B;

Very brief introduction on these projects:

\- Dogira is an ethereum-based token focused on bringing native blockchain gaming and asset-rewarding NFTs, in which one of the developers was part of the Dogecoin Team.

\- REAU is a newborn BSC token that aims on decentralized financial education and financial support for animal institutions.

&#x200B;

In two months, REAU members gathered more than U$19.200,00 for various institutions across the continent. **And they intend to do SO MUCH MORE with this Dogira partnership.**

Thank you!",nm85ds,2021-05-27 14:02:21,dehciappina,[],/r/Rarible/comments/nm85ds/charity_sale_dogira_reau_nfts_partnership_on/,73,0,12,73,4,nm85ds,post

Rarible,,"I've been part of REAU community and we are very glad to have our Dogira bros helping us in this fight.

REAU is a Brazilian charity token. In case you guys are not aware, Brazil (and its economy) is suffering from covid and this have a lot of social impacts: The donations income of dog shelters is ""dumping"" and many of those are closing bankrupted.

During the past two months, REAU community is getting together to make ""a single donation"" per week to different shelters (more than 10 so far). This ""single donation"" can be understood as an emergency check, most of it is expended for paying debts and emergencial costs.

Those NFTs and other REAU community campaigns are aiming to create a ""long run"" charity fund. So NGOs would have an monthly income that could be used to cover their expenses. Right now, two NGOs are registered to receive this monthly help. This number will increase with the increase of the fund.

All NGOs that are supported by REAU are selected by community/team-members that requires proofs of their needs and how this money is being applied. Some videos can be found in Viralata Finance Instagram.

Partnership with international folks (like Dogira) help us to attract international donations that will make a huge difference on those shelters.

This kind of parnership has a great value while we are developing the REAUPay, that will allow REAU investors to donate part of their reflect token profits and it will increase the adoption of REAU (increasing the donations).",gzn3c5w,2021-05-27 14:37:52,lucbrz,[],/r/Rarible/comments/nm85ds/charity_sale_dogira_reau_nfts_partnership_on/gzn3c5w/,1,0,,1,0,nm85ds,comment

Rarible,Astrozero Gasless NFT Marketplace Being Released!!!,"Astrozero is a gasless NFT marketplace that will be released in the very near future. Phase one of our comprehensive audit has completed and been passed with flying colors.   


Here's what's in it for the artist. Virtually free minting on the polygon network. 0.7% fees for the artist as opposed to the 2.5% on Rarible.   


Artist exposure and recognition on our telegrams, twitters, subreddit posts and all other social media platforms from our over 14,000 holders. 

Lastly we offer simple bridging from Eth <> Polygon instantly and for next to nothing. Thanks to #Hyphen from Biconomy, we'll be providing a ETH <> Polygon bridge directly on AstroZero, so you can transfer assets to/from both chains in a matter of seconds and at minimized network fees.

Rarible,,"This is the first of the eight limited crypto artwork experiences from the ""Future Perfect Continuous"" collection.

The zeitgeist of this artwork experience narrates extreme fiat currency devaluation.

Homeless boomer leans for a slice of rusty pizza through the waste bin full of banknotes. Everybody is throwing them away. Cold pizza, even with a pineapple on it, has more value.

It can be eaten at least (Of course, after you throw away all pineapples).

See that ad?

Paper recycling centers offering more Ether in exchange for regular paper and cartons than for fiat monies. Fiat just doesn't make sense. It's even bad for RECYCLING.

Rarible,Gas fees and costs on Rarible - Beginners guide - What does it cost to mint NFTs,"**First off understand this: All the fees you pay during the minting process do NOT go to Rarible.** You pay these gas fees to the miners of the ETH blockchain. The only time rarible really makes a profit is when you sell a NFT and they get 2.5% commission on the sales price.

The costs vary throughout the day, depending on how high the gas fees are at the moment. Gas fees right now are at an avarage of 130-over 200 GWEI throughout the day (1 GWEI =  0.000000001 ETH) on what the information here will be based on. **So make sure when you mint or list for sale to get a low gas price. To check prices and to predict low gas fees check these three websites:**

[**https://etherscan.io/**](https://etherscan.io/) shows you the gas price at the moment *\[low avarage and high, make sure always to pay a gas fee slightly above avarage if you want your NFT to be minted fast\]*

[**https://ethereumprice.org/gas/**](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) shows you a two week avarage price comparison *\[Helps to predict when fees could be lower\]*

[**https://rarible.illuday.com/**](https://rarible.illuday.com/) a great comparison on what will cost how much real time, adding more features weekly.

&#x200B;

1. **Minting a NFT** *\[****Strong advice:*** *Mint your NFT without listing for sale (deactivate the put on sale button). You can do that later and the price will be the same but you avoid multiple contracts where one could get stuck and you loose gas fees\]* **Will cost you around 40$-100$**. The costs for a single NFT (ERC 721) and a multiple (ERC 1155) are nearly the same. Prices are also the same if you mint in your own collection instead of using the RARI collection.
2. **List for sale** *\[This is only if you sell for a fixed price, not for auctions or accepting bids\]* **Will cost you around 10$-20$** per NFT. Same price for single or multiple NFT again. No further costs if you sell for the fixed price. *\[2.5% of sales price go to Rarible though\]*
3. **Creating your own collection** *\[This is optional. There is no real benefit for beginners to do this, this is rather a nice to have option for pros as they have their own ""Art gallery"" as i would call it and have their own token\]* **Will cost you around 600$-1400$.** Be aware to create the correct collection, a collection for multiples (ERC 1155) or singles (ERC 721). The collection can only hold NFTs that fit.
4. **Selling to a bid or on an auction** *\[If you do not sell for a fixed price you will cover the transaction costs for the NFT. So if you accept a bid you have to pay this fee. If you sell for a fixed price the buyer pays this fee\]* **Will cost you 40-100$**
5. **Burning a NFT** *\[If something went wrong or youre not happy with the NFT and you want to get rid of it, destroy it, it is called burn it\]* **Will cost you 4-10$**

Rarible,,"Great info. Could you please elaborate a little on:

>**Will cost you around 600$-1400$.** Be aware to create the correct collection, a collection for multiples (ERC 1155) or singles (ERC 721). The collection can only hold NFTs that fit.

By singles, do you mean one-of-a-kind items? By multiples, do you mean, idk, a limited edition of 25 copies? Does that mean you would need to open two stores, one to sell one-of-a-kind items, and another to sell the 25 copies of a limited edition? Am also not sure I understand the functional difference between ERC 721 and 1155.

I‚Äôm a photographer and graphic designer. I have some really awesome collections but it would take me probably 50k to get up and truly running on rarible. I truly want to bring my art to a new platform, but there is no guarantee my art will take off, so obviously the 50k could go into producing prints or funding travel to produce more art and participate in art shows and contests.

I wrote support on the 24th and no response. I'm not verified, but trying that too. Based on all my history, seems the NFT actually minted and it successfully on the blockchain, but rarible isn't rendering the image properly on their site.

Rarible,,"Correct, singles are a 1of1 multiples can be anything from 1of1 to 1000of1000. So my advice is to get a multiple collection if you are thinking about doing so. You can still create 1of1 but can act freely.

Usually and most of the time a collection is used for multiples in my opinion (there are no stats I would know about).

I can't really explain your last question. Let me put it this way: you can open a gallery on Main Street that only has place to hang up 20 paintings for display (ERC 721) or set up a gallery on side street that has space to hang up 1000 paintings for display (ERC 1155). Get the idea? ü§ì

The problem is that the grafic itsself has non readable faulty code somehow so something is wrong with your original file (that i can not check as i dont have the file, nor good skills in grafic design).

This NFT is messed up. There is also no change of changing the file. You will have to burn it, and create a new one. But check your grafic file first before doing again to avoid the same mess again.

1) What does listing multiples involve exactly? If say, listing a limited edition of 25, is it only minted once, while paying 25 listing fees? How does that work? Also - can I tweak each of the individual 25 pieces, or must they be absolutely identical?

2) If I break out the $800 to create a store, presumably it becomes part of the blockchain. Does that mean I can move the store between marketplaces - or better yet, clone it and have it live on more than one at the same time (say Rarible and OpenSea)?

Rarible,,"1. only minted once, one time fee (not 25 times fee). Think of it as one cake you pay for and buyers pay fee for getting one of the 25 slices. (Again this does not apply for auctions or if you accept bids then you pay transaction fees).

All 25 will be 100% identical. So no ""special unlock on edition 20 of 25"" or so. This is what ERC 721 editions do. (Mint same item 25 times as a one of one but one of them has special unlock)

2. That's hard to answer... you can take it over to opensea (list it, open sea will recognize it) but don't have to actually move it from Rarible. There are not to many other nameworthy platforms who have this integration until now but any (future) platform that provides ERC 1155 integration you will be able to move convert or use your own Collection on.

I don't understand why people who hate something go on a subreddit dedicated to the subject to deposit their hatred. If you don't like the principle you don't have to come here.

So he just gets a JPEG when he buys an NFT? I think you can print a JPEG to get it in physics. In addition to those you have the proof that this ""JPEG"" (or rather work of art) belongs to you. 

You're talking about someone who bought a ""fake"" Banksy, already I would like to know where you saw this because for the moment there are no sources. Of course, there are scams everywhere. Besides, I didn't know that an artwork is only a drawing. So you don't consider photography, music, or any other medium as art? In fact, many people who use 3D softwares draw before modeling it. You were talking about a fake banksy, which is amazing because for you art is drawing. He excels in graffiti first even if he also does paintings. So those paintings are art but not this graffiti? 

In the end, I only want a crybaby with no valid arguments crying because people are making money (even if it's not the final end of all those who post NFTS in my opinion).",gov5qgx,2021-02-26 18:49:41,_NABST,[],/r/Rarible/comments/lsvvo9/my_first_nft_ever_break_hearts_chrome_hearts_hope/gov5qgx/,9,0,,9,0,lsvvo9,comment
