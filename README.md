# Twitter

## 1. Text Co-occurence
- IPYNB - Python code to find frequency of word pairs, create Networkx graphs and save graph to GML file
- GML files - GML files for 4 tweet groups (Creator&Media, General, Compilers, Vogue Singapore)
- Gephi files - Gephi visualisations from above GML files (Creator&Media, General, Compilers, Vogue Singapore)
  - Gephi Filters - Use the below values for each Gephi file to Filter by Degree Range:
    - Compiler - 16
    - Vogue - 6 
    - Creator/Media - 16
    - General - 87

## 2. Sentiment Analysis
- IPYNB - Python code to process tweets, find sentiment for each tweet and create a trained model based on tweets which can predict the sentiment for an unseen tweet
- sav files - Trained model files
- CSV files - files with original tweets, processed tweet, tokenized tweet and sentiment

## 3. Topic Modelling
- Topic Modelling IPYNB - Python code to process tweets, run multiple LDA models of different topic numbers, find the right topic number, label each tweet with dominant topic
- topics_labelled files - files with processed tweets and topic labels for each Twitter user group
- topics_reptext files - files with topics and representative text for each Twitter user group
- Wordcloud images - Wordclouds of the top words for each topics for each Twitter user group
- TOPICS_LABELLED_FINAL - files including original/processes/tokenised tweets, dominant topics and % contributed, sentiment class and % sentiment
- Topic Sentiment IPYNB - Python code to create TOPICS_LABELLED_FINAL files
- Topic Sentiment Analysis Power BI - Power BI visualisation to see breakdown of sentiment per topic

## 4. Twitter Scraping & Pre-processing
- IPYNB files - Python code to scrape and pre-process twitter data

## 5. Data Folders
- raw twitter data - files containing scraped twitter data
- processed twitter data - filed containing pre-processed twitter data

# Reddit

## 1. scraping from reddit (praw) final
- IPYNB file that scraped reddit data
- Generates dataset folder (contains reddit content from separate subreddits, each as a csv file) and merged_raw_2.csv (combined data from all subreddits)

## 2. reddit pre processing + text analysis final
- IPYNB file that conducted preprocessing and basic text analysis
- Uses merged_raw_2.csv
- generates merged_clean.csv (combined data that has text column preprocessed and only keep identifying info) and merged_clean_scores (same as merged_clean but includes metrics such as upvotes, awards and num_comments for use in sentiment analysis)

## 3. text co-occurance
- IPYNB file to find frequency of word pairs, create Networkx graphs and save graph to GML file
- Uses merged_clean.csv
- Generates reddit_compiled.gml

## 4. sentiment analysis
- IPYNB file that process post/comment, find sentiment for each post/comment and create a trained model based on post/comment which can predict the sentiment for an unseen post/comment
- Uses merged_clean_scores.csv
- Generates sentiment_label.csv (identifiable posts with generated sentiment)

## 5. topic modelling
- IPYNB to process tweets, run multiple LDA models of different topic numbers, find the right topic number, label each tweet with dominant topic
- Uses merged_clean.csv, merged_clean_tm.csv(generated by this file, it is a further processed merged_clean, that is fine tuned for topic modelling) and merged_raw_2.csv
- Generated merged_clean_tm.csv

## CSV files
- merged_raw_2.csv : combined and raw dataset of all reddit posts and comments
- merged_clean.csv : combined data that has text column preprocessed and only keep identifying info
- merged_clean_scores.csv : same as merged_clean but includes metrics such as upvotes, awards and num_comments for use in sentiment analysis
- merged_clean_tm.csv : further processed merged_clean that is fine tuned for topic modelling
- sentiment_label.csv : identifiable posts with generated sentiment

## Gephi files
- reddit_compiled.gml - GML files for reddit posts/comments
- reddit_combined - Gephi visualisations from above GML file
  - Gephi Filters - Use the below values for each Gephi file to Filter by:
    - Degree range : minimum 1
    - Edge weight : minimum 1750
