Hundreds of people are believed to have been tricked into buying emblems depicting Perak royalty insignia and letters of appointment as royalty members, forking out RM2,000 (S$800) to RM5,000 (S$2,000) each.
Sources told the New Straits Times buyers were guaranteed that no action would be taken against them even if they were to tint their car windows with the darkest shade of tint or drive their vehicles at high speed.
It all went well for the new "royal family members" until a couple of them were stopped by police and fined for having dark-tinted windows and speeding.
"It was then that they realised that they were not protected from police action. After having spent thousands of ringgit, they were told there was no such thing as having immunity after doing wrong," said the source.
The matter came to light last week when a buyer lodged a police report in Bukit Mertajam and police started investigations into the fraudulent practice.
The source said the syndicate sold Perak royalty insignia and letters of appointment bearing the signature of one the top members of the Perak royal household to potential buyers.
"During meetings, normally held in hotels, a spokesman would tell potential buyers that he was connected to the Perak royal household and would propose a business transaction.
"Believing that the person they were talking to was a member of the Perak royalty, the buyers would easily part with their money," said the source.
He said the so-called royal, identified as one Pak Ungku, would hand over the emblem and letter of appointment with the royal household letterhead after several days.
According to a source in Dewan Negara Perak, the syndicate may have sold hundreds, if not thousands, of fraudulent emblems and letters of appointment.
At a press conference yesterday, Perak State Secretary Datuk Abdul Puhat Mat Nayan said the state government had never issued and did not recognise any emblem to denote a person's status as a "royalty member".
