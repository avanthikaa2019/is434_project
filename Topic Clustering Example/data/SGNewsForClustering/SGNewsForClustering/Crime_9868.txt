A technician has been sentenced to six months imprisonment after the court found him guilty of molesting a 13-year-old girl on board a bus.
The court was told that Tan Meng Long, 30, had shifted from his original seat to one next to the girl on board SBS bus service 53 on October 4, 2010.
He placed his left hand on her breast when she fell asleep.
When the victim woke up, she saw Tan withraw his hand and then pretend to read a newspaper.
The matter came to the attention of the girl's mother when it was reported to a disciplinary mistress in her school.
Police arrested Tan a fortnight later.
On Thursday, he was found guilty and could have been sentenced to two years in jail, fined, caned, or a combination of any of those punishments.
