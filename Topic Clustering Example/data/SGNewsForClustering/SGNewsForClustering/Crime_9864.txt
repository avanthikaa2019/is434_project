SERDANG - An elderly couple were found bludgeoned to death in their single-storey home in Kampung Baru Seri Kembangan, here, early yesterday morning.
Their mentally-unstable nephew who stayed with them was arrested at the house several hours later to facilitate murder investigations.
The victims, Lee Yoke Mun, 73, and his wife Lee Kam Lin, 68, were found in the bathroom and the master bedroom respectively with head injuries.
It was learnt that the victims were attacked at about 5am when the suspect's parents, who also live in the same house, had gone to open their stall at the nearby wet market.
They rushed home after being alerted by a neighbour about a commotion at 5.30am to find the elderly couple dead.
Serdang police chief Superintendent Abdul Razak Elias said initial investigations revealed that the victims and the suspect's families had not been on talking terms for quite some time due to a dispute, although they lived under the same roof.
"The attack could have been the result of the suspect's grudge against the couple.
"We also learnt that the victims had frequently abused the suspect verbally, but these allegations are still being investigated," Razak said.
A police team was sent to the house about 6.15am after neighbours raised the alarm regarding a loud commotion coming from the house.
They arrested the 44-year-old suspect who was still at home. Initial checks revealed that he worked as a mechanic.
Police also seized an iron rod which was believed to have been used in the attack.
The suspect's father, who is also Yoke Mun's elder brother, said the victims had always called his son "stupid and crazy".
He claimed that the suspect suffered mental problems since he met with a road accident about 20 years ago.
The bodies were sent to Serdang Hospital for a post-mortem.
