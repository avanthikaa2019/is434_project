decentraland,I got another big idea let's get AMC to put a theater in Decentraland!,"AMC knows that after what happened to their sales with the pandemic they are in a tight spot and are loosing the battle to online streaming services. What if they not only got into online in a big way but still kept the spirit of physically going to the theaters and hanging out with friends. They can sell tickets that you can buy using Mana. Users would be able to walk to a pizza kiosk and order a pizza and then go to theater and hangout with their friends and watch a movie together all without leaving their house and the game!


Edit: It's happening someone built a theater yo AMC where you at you don't want to miss this opportunity

decentraland,,"Working on a post to connect the dots for folks between decentraland and polygon/matic and quick swap.  I’ll post something with all the research links at some point, but basically as I understand it the transfer of wearables in decentraland can be made cheaper with polygon/matic.  The gas fees are tiny compared to ether.  So Polygon/Matic should be a winner.  Then, just as Uniswap and Pancake and all the pools on ether have gone apeshit, Quickswap is the same idea, but built on matic.  So you get trading pools with lower fees.  There are articles out there about how to switch from ethereum mainnet to matic main net in metamask and how to get your ether wrapped and into a mining pool.   

Don’t sell MANA, heavens no!  But I think Polygon/Matic and Quickswap are going to be enormous winners along the same growth path.",gquaer2,2021-03-13 22:17:22,Professor_Smallz,[],/r/decentraland/comments/m4e5rg/upvote_mana_to_the_moon/gquaer2/,24,0,,24,0,m4e5rg,comment

decentraland,,"To everybody just hating on this idea without giving any specific reasons or examples for a while it is useless or dumb… this same concept is already being used for ghost kitchens.

I’m calling it now within six months there will be a Mr. beast burger in the game. No restaurant likes admitting  it’s a ghost kitchen so they are going to want to be in the metaverse.

The concept is simple. One it is great advertising because you’re not going to see one driving around(like many dispensaries)

2,People have a much better experience and feel less rushed when they can wait in a virtual queue while simultaneously being able to look at all of the different products available at that very moment and no I just read a description online

Also I’m just saying, discounted Cannabis that you can buy with Crypto does not sound like a dumb idea by any stretch of the imagination. Crypto cannabis Club has literally already saved me money.

By being a holder I am eligible for particular discounts. The NFT was $350 at time  and I only recently found a partnering strain I liked at a close enough dispensary. I’ve saved roughly $500 and the NFT increased

I know this is long winded but it’s better than a one-word answer. Many people that are calling this dumb or just laughing at the idea won’t admit it but they were laughing at the idea of virtual lands when I try to explain the beauty of it",hpe0la3,2021-12-21 04:55:48,TheGreatAspie91,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rkwcaw/please_vote_for_the_dispensary_to_get_added_to/hpe0la3/,1,0,,1,0,rkwcaw,comment

I legitimately don’t understand how you can have that profile picture NFT(no disrespect intended) and find value in it yet not find value in peoples ability to potentially buy cannabis with crypto (likely heavily discounted and top strains) while being able to I have a much better understanding of the different options instead of just having to read a description like on websites",hpdzhhb,2021-12-21 04:45:34,TheGreatAspie91,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rkwcaw/please_vote_for_the_dispensary_to_get_added_to/hpdzhhb/,8,0,,8,0,rkwcaw,comment

decentraland,Welcome to Decentralands Subreddit,"# Welcome

As our community is quickly growing, we would like to take this chance to welcome everyone to [*r/Decentraland*](https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland/). Please be mindful of the rules in this Subreddit and be sure to treat everybody with respect.

# What is Decentraland?

Decentraland is a community-driven Metaverse, powered by the Ethereum Blockchain. It makes use of a Cryptocurrency called [MANA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decentraland), which is the main medium of exchange used in Decentralands ecosystem. Users can create, experience, and monetize content. It offers a [Builder Tool](https://builder.decentraland.org) or [SDK (developer toolkit)](https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/SDK-101/), which are designed to create virtual environments and applications.

You can simply experience, make friends and have conversations by [jumping in](https://play.decentraland.org).

Feel free to check out our [Blog](https://decentraland.org/blog/) for project and developer updates, jump into [Discord](https://decentraland.org/discord/) or [Telegram](https://t.me/DecentralandTG) channels to join the conversation. Also, you can subscribe to our [mailing list](https://decentraland.org/) to stay up to date on the latest developments and happenings!

Vr support will give people much more reason to interact with their own spaces in a meaningful way even if there aren’t other players there. I still remember the very early days with a vive, playing in valves mock up room space with various toys and art and a view. Spent way to much time there just goofing around.

Even worse, there's barely any active users in the world when I've been on (literally only a couple hundred whenever I've jumped in - which doesn't feel great?)

Curious if there's info that tracks active users / accounts setup over time since inception..

decentraland,A bunch of absolute rookies,"I’m blown away by the amount of people asking things like, it’s dropping what should I do? Why is it dropping? When should I buy? When should I sell? 

Investing is quite simple if you can be mature about it. I know for a lot of you that’s quite difficult but for those that can be and haven’t yet done the study on the golden rules I’ll give you a few tips. 

1 ) Forget about trying to make a quick buck. Quick money is for beginners and more often than not you will get burnt. As an investor you need to think 5-10 years into the future. Yes you can make a few grand now and buy whatever you’re into but then you will be back to where you started with deprecating assets. 

You want to be at a point where your money works for you. When do you want to buy a house or retire? Take a pen write down how much you earn each year minus expenses. How many years do you need to save for that home deposit? 5-10 years? It’s time you make a plan so these years don’t go to waste and trust me without a plan they will. 

2 ) Set aside emergency funds. Set aside cash for large ticket items that pop up. The rest of your current cash can be invested. If you need to buy a car in 6 months time don’t invest now with that cash you may be under. It’s not worth the risk. Don’t have emergency funds? You need to learn to save before you learn to invest. 

3 ) The number one goal of investing is don’t lose money. It’s not about making it, it’s about making sure you don’t have less than what you started out with. Making money on top is the bonus we strive for. Protect your money first, don’t gamble. 

4 ) Do your research on a number of investments. Diversify, across industries. Don’t put in a dollar unless you understand the business. If you don’t understand it, you don’t know who the competition is, If they make the right or wrong moves or what the future looks like. That’s not protecting your cash. 

5 ) Allocate most funds towards safer options and less towards riskier options. Bitcoin, Ethereum being safer than MANA for example. You may say I’m wrong but that’s your research not mine which is fine. 

6 ) You gotta stop checking it. Remove the emotions. You haven’t made or lost anything till you pull it out. Why look early? A machine will make better investment decisions because if they are told to hold for 5 years they only look again in 5 years. Read news and updates, the price is the current price, that’s it. 

7 ) Don’t bail on your plan. Don’t jump from ship to ship chasing the gainers. Don’t try to trade highs and lows.  It costs money and you’re not going to be gifted at it. If that was a viable way to make money traders would be everywhere. They all have day jobs. Trading is a gambling game. 

8 ) Look towards the future. Price is up, should I sell? Where will the price be when VR is announced? Where will the price be when large retail stores, gaming companies surprise us by setting up shop? 

This is the beginning of a new world and I’m so stoked to be apart of the early years. You’re better off being in and getting it wrong than missing out. Stay strong, think of the future. 

I’m not saying good luck because it’s got nothing to do with it. Be smart.",m6uei9,2021-03-17 06:57:09,Waylan-J-Sands,[],/r/decentraland/comments/m6uei9/a_bunch_of_absolute_rookies/,287,0,76,287,18,m6uei9,post

I would be lying if I told you I didn't have a good chunk of my money in just Mana because I really believe in this project. But I would also be lying if I told you I didn't put money in other coins. I am trying to just not check but I did take a peak and I found that overall I was still up a good amount compared to what I put in because other coins had gone up and covered what I lost on Mana. So hang tight don't go around panick selling you'll get nowhere, don't spend more than you can afford to loose you will end up poorer at the end of the day, and most importantly stop looking every 5 minutes. When I bought Mana I bought it after reading about it and liking the concept but basically just put it out if my mind until it spiked and now I'm back to just basically ignoring the price changes. Let it happen it's a good idea and a long term hold but don't freak out that's a good thing you're not going to have a fun time doing taxes in crypto anyway if you try and day trade.",gr85cxf,2021-03-17 11:26:23,PCgaming4ever,[],/r/decentraland/comments/m6uei9/a_bunch_of_absolute_rookies/gr85cxf/,1,0,,1,0,m6uei9,comment

decentraland,Guys remember even though we are enjoying the gains right now don't focus on the price focus on making sure Decentraland is full of new things to do and big ideas.,"Everyone is getting hyped for the price increase myself included. However let's step back and remember why most of us bought in. We bought in on an idea that Decentraland is the future of online gaming. Lots of us bought in because we see how this can turn into our ready player one world. We will not sell we will HODL and we will keep pushing the boundaries of this game just like Atari, the casinos, and the Pizza Kiosk. What keep something from becoming another alt coin pump and dump are the users and this user base is full of amazing people and ideas. Don't loose sight of that don't let off the gas pedal because we have seen some gains. Instead drop down a gear and go harder spreading the word, invent new ideas and things to do. Their are other competitors and we need to make sure when users are looking into virtual worlds they see how vibrant our community is and how much people love it.

It’s cool they made that, but I think the community would have received it better with him actually feeling more present than he actually was. (Supposedly he joined in for a bit and chatted) With the current limitations I can see why it wasn’t as doable since the servers spiked to over 1500 people during that hour. 

The game is still in beta and in browser. Used some less populated servers to have things load, but it was a really good stress test for DCL. 

On a side note, I’m a fan of how the wearables worked this time. Having to mint on the spot versus people still waiting since last Halloween with rewards that will maybe eventually mint them or not, and so many of the other Atari items that may never be minted with the previous flow of how it worked.",gwch6q1,2021-04-29 21:09:23,Xetalatex,[],/r/decentraland/comments/n1192v/atari_opening_night/gwch6q1/,2,0,,2,0,n1192v,comment

decentraland,,"Well this is actually because GTA radio is curated by underground selected artist/curators some of them are actual dj's or have record labels.

For example Worldwide FM is curated by Giles Peterson (BBC Radio) 

Throughout his career, Peterson has played a pivotal role in promoting genres such as jazz, hip-hop, and electronic music. He started his career on pirate radio stations Radio Invicta and K-Jazz, later joining legal stations in London, first the newly founded Jazz FM, and then onto the dance music station Kiss FM.[6] In 1998, he was hired by BBC Radio 1, and in 2012 he began hosting a three-hour Saturday afternoon programme on BBC Radio 6 Music.[7] He hosts a syndicated radio programme that is broadcast in seven European countries.

The person who selected these artists is top notch, rockstar selected the best curators.",gt09cu5,2021-04-01 07:42:38,IntroductionUnable26,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mh9hpc/just_seen_this_on_fb_felt_this_is_a_great_spot_to/gt09cu5/,2,0,,2,0,mh9hpc,comment

As a seasoned crypto trader I know how to spot a project and hold it. I’m not an Altcoin flipper. I’ve got high expectations for this token and the game itself is awesome. A lot of fun. There’s a lot of shitty members in this group that think they know everything. Don’t listen to those smug basement dwelling choads. This is a great time to be holding. Ride it out if you can afford to and buy dips if you wish! Not financial advice but many of us in here are interested in conversation about the utility itself. The “gamers” on here think their tough and may try to silence your opinion. Those people are not real supports of Decentraland. Their what is called bandwagon jumpers!

decentraland,,"I am an altcoin flipper and I’m holding MANA. So that says something. 

Well, most of it. I admittedly sold a little to recoup my initial purchase from 0.23 so realistically not very much. That may be frowned upon but it makes it easy for me to hold going forward knowing I am “playing with house money.” As someone who rarely holds anything for more than 3 weeks, I have good reason to believe MANA will keep running. 

Worth noting it’s one of the only NFT platforms that aren’t relying on infringing on trademarks. If you look at any of the other popular NFT’s right now, they are built around trademarked characters. When some of those  NFT’s are accounting for millions in sales, it’s only a matter of time until the hammer come down on those with cease and desist notices from big corps that have their own separate plans for entering the NFT market. DCL is truly original and will inhale a lot of the NFT market share as the others collapse.",gt42ku2,2021-04-02 05:04:12,machinegunchili,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mhyg23/grayscale_bought_7290372_mana_lets_go/gt42ku2/,3,0,,3,0,mhyg23,comment

I dropped into the JP Morgan site this morning and it was underwhelming. There's a tiger stalking around the lobby, for some reason. And a timeline of JP Morgan's history with crypto.  Click the timeline for a link to their website -- which is easier to navigate and read, at least. 

Oh, and there's a spiral staircase up to a ""meeting"" room. Don't get me started on spiral staircases in Decentraland. They're everywhere. I guess DCL has no way to teleport to the next level.

decentraland,,"Ideas are one thing. But implementing them is another. Internet speeds are too slow. Right now it takes an age to render a cat, let alone a complete world, with millions of others taking part in real time. Yes, 5G is around the corner, but people are used to things happening instantly. If it's laggy or clunky then they'll move on almost instantly. People are spoilt and super impatient. For the metaverse to take off, it needs to be a ready to use, nice and shiny product that functions seamlessly out of the box. Also, even if Meta gave out free headsets/optic viewers/glasses to everyone, it takes time for people to adapt to, and adopt new behaviours for viewing content. 

Then there's the massive question of legality on the metaverse, which no one seems to be addressing. What rights/behaviours does my avatar have that are enforceable in the real world? (For example if I've invested real money in property, but are a massive racist bellend, can I lose my real investment on the platform? Can I run over children, GTA-style? Or steal shit? Have a thousand avatars of me doing all sorts of unsociable stuff? Or create a metaverse that instantly deletes all coloured people. The list is endless). So, to answer your question, a minimum of 10 years.",hrlxlxo,2022-01-07 07:24:38,Putapest,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rxf0g5/samsung_enters_the_metaverse_opening_flagship_837/hrlxlxo/,2,0,,2,0,rxf0g5,comment
decentraland,,"You raise valid points. The tech is not there for a fully immersive wonderful, like-the-movies experience. However, the internet didn’t start out as what I saw in the movies either. I got my first internet connected computer in 1998 and lived on the thing just like every other person under 30 i knew. Within a few years everyone I knew of any age spent way too much time on the internet but do you realize that it took 7 years from that point for YouTube to come out? I remember in 2005 being shocked that a video website could exist because loading times on video were stupid long up to that point and bandwidth for a video was monsterously expensive. 

Just two years later we got iPhones but for all the internet addicted years prior to that songs took 5 hours to download, images were wallet sized and grainy and took 30 seconds to load. You got kicked off the internet every time some picked up the phone and god forbid you had to turn off your computer because it took 8 minutes to turn it back on and everything you were doing was gone if you didn’t save it. 

But we did it. We moved past all the hurdles and within just a few short years of mass internet adoption we had iPhones. 

The metaverse doesn’t start out as a virtual reality wonderland equipped smell-o-vision and special suits so we can really feel our favorite alien prostitute poke us in the belly button or whatever people are into then. It starts out with simple games, office meetings, AR overlays, vr toys, gimmicks, experiments, going to a grocery store in decentraland to do my Amazon grocery shopping instead of their clicking on images on their website. Most of this stuff we are a couple years out from. Bill Gates  just came out and said office meetings in the metaverse are 2-3 years away from replacing video calls and the only reason it isn’t happening now is because cameras were already built into computers so it was easier to adopt on the spot in 2020. But the tech for that is here already. 

As far as legal, I don’t think it’s all that complicated. You seem to be wrestling with morality more than law and we’ve dealt with morality (and legal) issues on the internet for 25 years already. 3D space doesn’t change much and neither does ownership. 

Instead of twitter making the rules and enforcing them it’s the DAOs.  DAOs as a first level of defense and actual law on a second level of the person does something illegal in their country. It’s not illegal in most places to be racist but the DAO acts as a central authority that can act to ban certain behaviors. Even if they can’t ban a person from entering the metaverse because let’s say that person owns land there that they paid for with real money, that doesn’t mean I as a user can’t block that person so I don’t have to interact with them. I mean, I lived in nyc for 15 years. There were plenty of people I would have loved to have had that option with but that’s real life so I didn’t. 

So what if someone starts running over kids? Blocked. Now their pixels can no longer interact with the (any?) kids pixels. A thousand avatars touching themselves in front of strangers? Blocked. Ok but what if they just do it with another account? Content filters. All of this stuff exists already because social media is a nightmare that’s already had to deal with all this. Stealing stuff? I mean it’s crypto. Ownership is on the blockchain right? How do you steal?  Does leaving the Gucci NFT store with a tshirt stuffed in your pants automatically remove the nft from the stores wallet and put it in yours? That would be a pretty weird thing to code in to your store. Did you hack the store to steal? Is hacking and theft illegal in your country, state, or city? Yes? Then the local authorities and courts deal with it just like they would now. 

In the end, I think it’s easy to make this far more complex than it actually is. Most of what we need to police it we already have and there’s no need for this to be a polished and perfect experience for mass adoption. People adopt small things, learn, find value, get hooked, accept issues as part of the deal and celebrate improvements for a few seconds before quickly believing we always had it this good. We do that with everything. Why not the metaverse? 

My mom hated cell phones until candy crush. She doesn’t even play it anymore but we can’t get her off the damn phone. It only took that one stupid game for total adoption of the tech she hated.",hrm6yrl,2022-01-07 09:18:36,k_fitness1,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rxf0g5/samsung_enters_the_metaverse_opening_flagship_837/hrm6yrl/,2,0,,2,0,rxf0g5,comment
decentraland,,"Thank you for your reply. You make valid points. I guess my biggest concerns is the enforcement of behaviours on a platform that bills itself as without limits. Most people think of Ready Player One as a blueprint of the metaverse. I tend to think of Stranger Days, where there's a black market for self-made point of death videos. If we all have to conform in the same manner as in the real world, then a lot of the appeal will be lost. Also, with many platforms having an eye primarily on making bank, much will be off limits without some form of payment. Personally, I feel that movies like Ready Player One have done the whole metaverse genre a huge disservice, as it'll be a long time before these platforms can present anything close to the crisp, vivid and life-like movie experience.",hrmb68c,2022-01-07 10:12:53,Putapest,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rxf0g5/samsung_enters_the_metaverse_opening_flagship_837/hrmb68c/,1,0,,1,0,rxf0g5,comment
decentraland,,"I don’t think it bills itself as without limits. Just without a corporate owned central authority. I think these things are billed very much in a libertarian sense where you are free to do what you want as long as it doesn’t cause harm to others. It’s not the purge. 

But while a digital world doesn’t allow limitless dickheadery, it does allow people to be someone other than themselves and if you’ve spent 5 minutes on Instagram you know that we love that. Look at my perfect life. Look how perfect it is! #nofilter lol. 

I don’t think most people are sitting around waiting for the metaverse so they can watch murder vids and run over kids and I don’t think the makers or the investors making it happen are out there marketing that as the future you didn’t know you always wanted. 

Most people just want to show off how cool they are, make some cash, hangout with friends, make something, or play dumb games.  We’re really not that Interesting. 

But I do agree that some folks will open up decentraland and expect ready player one and clearly that’s not going to happen right now.",hrmi0xc,2022-01-07 11:38:00,k_fitness1,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rxf0g5/samsung_enters_the_metaverse_opening_flagship_837/hrmi0xc/,1,0,,1,0,rxf0g5,comment

I had been looking into how I could combine energy clearing with the crypto realm and this seems like a great way to do it.  I'm not really involved in Decentraland in any way, though I think it's a really neat idea, but I could definitely imagine people being more comfortable doing therapy that way than the traditional ways.  I can definitely see kids being more open to it!  Kind of like when they used to have them talk to a puppet or stuffed animal to help them feel comfortable opening up.  Check out the show Upload.  They have some scenes where the therapist is virtual with an avatar.",gtzwckw,2021-04-10 01:13:05,Conscious-Eye-9313,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mnojfe/vr_therapy_office_in_decentraland/gtzwckw/,1,0,,1,0,mnojfe,comment

decentraland,,"Great idea! There is this YouTube channel I saw that uses VR to give his guests the opportunity to anonymously tell their traumatic or controversial stories. This could certainly be a really cool format for you to use as well! (I understand you could not record the sessions obviously)

I think this would be a great way to practice your profession In a truly decentralized way. It’s becoming more common to have therapy sessions over the phone. VR bridges the gap left by losing the face to face interaction while also keeping both parties anonymous.

I have Mana of course, purchased for a far higher price than you have, imo, wisely bought today. I'd be happy to see anything over $5 tbh, but I will be patient. To an extent. As a long-time gamer, I hope I will see the writing on the wall early enough in the worst case scenario.

decentraland,,"OK: I'm going to start by saying that this is not financial advice and I am completely unqualified. Also that I don't think you or anyone else should bet the farm on it. Investment is a complicated matter and you should spread out your portfolio and diversify it so that if one thing fails, you've got another thing to fall back on. 

Also, I want to say that I have been *incredibly* whingey and critical of the whole thing from Day One: I've looked at the app and moaned about it, I've bought a few MANA and moaned about getting burned at the exchange - frnakly, it's a wonder these guys put up with me.

Now, as to why I think it has potential:

* There's a real product which you can try out at https://play.decentraland.org (It does have some system requirements, but it exists, which is more than can be said for most crypto ""investments""!)

* The people behind it seem to be genuine, they are real coders / entrepeneurs - and they have been developing it for six years. They have taken their time to create it, launching in beta in 2017 and open to the public in 2020. This shows that these guys are no fly-by night operation!

* Likewise, MANA has been around for years. They used it to raise funding to develop the product.

* Metaverse stuff is very hot right now, and will continue to be so for some time. OK, this isn't available on VR just yet, all we have right now is a Second Life-style browser game, but Meilich and Ordando have shown that they are in it for the long haul and I'm sure they're working on it even as we speak.

* Again, the people who created this are *real people*, not shady crapcoin punks - they work using their real names and have shown a commitment to the product. You can look them up, they have Twitter accounts in their real names, Decentraland has a Wikipedia page, etc. I'd say this was a good bet if you want to get involved with / support Metaverse type stuff, though I don't have a lot of cash to put in it - well worth a punt. NOT your life savings, but certainly a little side bet if you can afford it. 

* Also, with todays price crash you can get your hands on MANA at a nice little discount.  (probably best to spread out your purchaches though in case it does go lower)",hkvj386,2021-11-16 17:19:15,AndyTron_McBadass,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qvb9oj/while_checking_the_news_every_day_i_see/hkvj386/,24,0,,24,1,qvb9oj,comment

And the dev team does pull the plug of these games for whatever reasons, will these games completely cease to exist?

decentraland,,I believe art forms it’s own meanings for each person but to me its saying that nothing is out of your reach on this planet we call Earth. If you use your mind the world is quite literally at your finger tips. Nothing is out of reach if you believe it enough. A lot of people see an individual such as themselves as a small speck on a vast planet but if you flip the script you could be this giant with the whole world in the palm of your hand.,h1y9gmx,2021-06-16 09:56:22,atrilluh,[],/r/decentraland/comments/o0f3dp/have_a_feeling_this_will_be_my_first_nft_i_sell/h1y9gmx/,1,0,,1,0,o0f3dp,comment

decentraland,,"Oh absolutely its love! It was just a joke! Its comes from the notion that all NFT's are is for the protection of the owner and for the monetization of art. We as humans like to feel like we own things right? We need to have possession of it, esspecially to monetize it and make money off it. So to protect those things, using blockchain tech is a really awesome tool for it. But i just really fundamentally disagree with the expansion of what seems to be a biological imperative that our ego (which is there to protect us) instinctual wants to posses things because we all fear that our basic needs are threatened. In the world we live now, realistically all of our basic needs cam be met. Our subconscious autonomic behavior and thoughts is a powerful thing my friend. All of it, every single thing on this planet is ours, its all of ours. We can all perceive it that way by building trust through honest and vulnerable communication. Vulnerable communication builds and understanding of one another. An understanding of one another builds empathy. When you have empathy for another you can hold space to build trust within collected experiences. When we have trust we can move towards unity. 😊 i really want a damn sticker for this one at least ❤",h203olt,2021-06-16 19:14:59,Revolutionary-Crab24,[],/r/decentraland/comments/o0f3dp/have_a_feeling_this_will_be_my_first_nft_i_sell/h203olt/,2,0,,2,0,o0f3dp,comment

I'm not a ""trader"" by the way, I bought into DCL heavy a few months ago when it was \~.90 since to me anything under that seemed like a steal. I only buy/hold BTC and Ether but when I saw MANA the degenerate gambler part of my brain said ""DO IT"" and I bashed TF out of that buy button lol MANA is my personal fuck it moonshot project. I didn't want look back 5 years from now upset I didn't buy into my gut feeling that this thing is going to be HUGE. I think it was Mark Cuban that recently said something to the effect of ""people gravitate towards fun"" in regards to investing in NFTs and decentralized metaverses. I saw MANA and DCL as a credible opportunity to go All In; either this is going to be the dumbest financial decision of my young life or 5+ years from now I'll be patting myself on the back for taking the risk. DCL is still in its infancy, as much as I want this baby to run already it can't even stand on its own two legs at this point lol so much needs to happen before we get there but I'll tell you what this baby is crawling just dandy right now.

decentraland,"If in world vendors are not keeping their costs updated to the current price of MANA, this game will go nowhere.","Right now, a pair of pants in game, just regular pants, costs over a 1000 MANA at the moment. Thats around 1000 USD right now. Playing a simple game for fun costs  over 100 bucks for a single play.

I get it, the people who bought loads when it was cheap as hell want it to stay up here, but honestly, until the game is more active, and I mean heavily active, and more land is bought up, everything in the world seems incredibly overpriced. 

The only way the game works in its current state, is if the entire thing was a means to just make the creators rich from the very start. God knows someone is getting rich with the way you have to  jump through hoops just to buy MANA without getting raked in fees. 

The world definitely has potential, but there needs to be some sort of active attempts to balance things in game, or you wont get near the new people interested. Balance the economy in a way that people can still get in at a low level of cost and actually do stuff, and this game could be as big as second life used to be in its prime.

decentraland,,"  

I have a piece of land I would be willing to let someone use for free if they are willing to build a free interactive game on the plot. Or a virtual grocery store. I see DCL as a fun place for people to interact with their friends and mess around like any other game, but I also see a business modality that allows DCL to be a new and fun way to interact with the internet. Somewhat of an online interactive Amazon! Time will tell…

If were just building a game, I see this as an investment into the future of DCL, and a future money maker for the creator themselves. While no money is to be made right away the idea is to build potential over time. This is not for those seeking a get rich quick scheme!! Just a simple shoot em up arcade game or maybe a free fun trivia game, the sky’s the limit you decide! 

Although no money will be made for the initial work, gaining a name for the plot itself will set up great potential for future monetization of a game or activity. The plot is in a good location that is visible from the museum. Location is 18, 86

decentraland,,"The prices are a little nuts right now but I understand it. Right now the ""game"" is in early adopter phase and that means everything in it is going to be for enthusiasts, investors, and people dreaming of riches who have a few bucks to spend who see that $1000 pair of pants as an investment. 

The game needs these people to create an economy that is interesting to the second layer of adopters. 

The problem right now isn't so much the price of a pair of pants but the cost to interact with eth. Lots of the released merch is free if you can swing the gas fees. But with gas fees so high, free becomes more than most people can afford to spend. If those fees were down, a wider variety of people would be able to start their collections and that would bring more interest. 

At the same time, if in a few years decentraland has  a few million players, those $1000 pants from today will be a rare status symbol and in most cases they probably won't lose their value even if you can get a new pair of pants for free or a few bucks. And since that's the case, and because it can cost $100 to claim a free item and another $100 to list it for sale, those prices on the OG stuff are going to be going down any time soon.

decentraland,,"This was the exact same conversation a buddy and I were having just last week. We were thinking an internal program that calculates value of when things are made then adjusts to the current mana value wouldn't be as hard as it sounded (programmers here as well) and were thinking that there was already someplace else we had come across that does this adjustments, but we couldn't then (nor now) recall the name of the marketplace that did this. This was after we were looking for land and seeing how crazy expensive it has become compared to a couple of months ago when we first considered it. I was personally considering building a gallery for my NFTs (that I create) as well as to advertise for an upcoming mobile game project. At this rate I'm also concerned of buying land inflated and then having new lands released as well afterward.  
  
I love mana and am maybe 99% behind it (being honest) as I still would like to see steps forward in Decentraland inflation, graphics wise, and server (stability, etc) wise since those are the main issues I hear most about from people I talk to the project about who then try it out. I am looking forward to the upcoming launch of the casino and maybe even what NFTs could mean for bringing REAL Art Museums to Decentraland as well, but with those new projects comes new money and even more price inflation unless things are fixed. Especially if kids are going to ever get involved these all need to be looked at, because let's face it, virtual class trips could easily be the next step beyond having ""arcades"" for them to spend time playing games at. All tese issues need to be looked at before they become a worse problem and people get turned off by the experience.

because the stuff I was working on in SL was perfect for people working at

out now is that next wave but I will not hold my breath. As a marketing person  
the name Decentraland is pretty terrible and as a technical person I tried to  
go in world last week and Decentraland kept crashing and was difficult to use  
and doesn’t have many options. And BTW back in my SL days it was not the book ‘Ready  
Player One’ it was ‘Snow Crash.’   
I hope it does well, I really do. As a Metaverse pioneer

decentraland,,"That's just the style... Could change, but I kind of like it. Any limitations of the client is just that - client limitations. It can be changed and replaced as easily as it is to write a client. If you're looking for realistic graphics, I suggest Alyx. It's a great game actually, a lot of cool environments and experiences.

The attractiveness of Decentraland is being the first metaverse secured by the block chain. You know those luxury items, like watches, that cost a lot, but they put your ownership on the Blockchain. It's like that. Proof of ownership. It's virtual real estate you can do what you want with and share it with the world on the Blockchain. No one can take that away from you. It's rare limited supply, and one of the first of its kind. If the Metaverse actually takes off like good ol' Zuck wants it to, then these will be cool collectables one could flex and show off. There really isn't any point to owning virtual land other than the luxury of owning it. Your virtual avatar doesn't need to sleep, it doesn't get you anymore storage space, and the only traffic you'll get are other people also interested in and invested in making the metaverse a reality.

Decentraland is still growing though so all this can change if the userbase directs it to. More land could be added, the interface can change, could be that Genesis City no longer is prime real estate, and some new city is where it's at. Whatever the case, the *big draw* as you put it is the big draw of anything crypto-related. Proof of ownership cryptographically secure giving you full say of what to do with the resource you own. No one can ever take this away from you unless you will it. Other platforms like Steam, Amazon, etc. Can always ban you and take away all your assets for any reason they want - they're centralized and in control. Here the individual is in control. If I wanted I could run a smear campaign on all my parcels in an attempt to drive down the price. No one has the authority to stop me. Freedom at the finest...

decentraland,,"Same. I’m very new at this (started at the end of January, like many).  I get the whole “not your keys not your crypto” thing.....but at the same time, don’t really care about that since I have my crypto in 4 different exchanges anyways (anchor usd, binance us, Robinhood, and Coinbase) Anchor usd being the most user/beginner friendly one of them all. I mean it’d hurt if one of them shut down or for some reason stole all my crypto...but it’s not like I have tens of thousands in any of them or something. I’d survive in that already unlikely scenario. 

The main thing that has left me frustrated with the whole complexity of the uniswap thing though, is because there are like 2-3 alt coins that I’m very interested in investing in, and they’re not on any other reputable exchange yet. Also sucks that regular binance has so many coins that the US binance users don’t have access to. By the time some coins make it to the mainstream exchanges that I use, a lot of the gains opportunities to be had will have vanished already, since popularity is what gets them on the buy-exchanges in the first place. Just wish there was one tutorial I could find that could explain it to me like I were someone who had just heard of crypto. Guess I’m just gonna have to read a whole book on it or something to get there. And yea the fees seem crazy too....especially for someone like me who can’t put a whole lot into it...like is it worth it to pay gas fees for a measly 100-200$ transfer?",gua1488,2021-04-12 17:47:17,TheWalkingDead91,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mp6b3c/can_now_use_usdt_and_atri_in_the_dg_casinos_how/gua1488/,2,0,,2,0,mp6b3c,comment

Also since this comment is getting lots of attention don't put all your eggs in one basket. Yes I have most of mine in Mana because at the end of the day I see the biggest potential and it's a project I 100% believe in. However because I had also put money into other coins during the dip I was still in the green overall riding the waves from other coins. But I will say now is the time to buy Mana if your going to do it but don't buy it then freak out over price drops you gotta hold that stuff for years.

decentraland,,"I think what it is was people panicked when it dipped and put sell orders in for whenever it reached $1 again to get back what they lost because they aren't even paying attention to what is actually going in with the coin they just want the money.

decentraland,The secret to MANA going up.,"I see a bunch of people asking, “what does everyone think mana can go to? I bought in at XYZ. Is that a good price?”

Those are all the wrong questions. If you believe in the utility of mana, then buy in. Once you buy in, the next step… 

PLAY! Then get your friends and their friends to PLAY! 

The ONLY way mana grows is if the daily user base continues to grow. Y’all need to be posting about how fucking absolutely amazing DL is and how much fun you’re having. Make that shit go viral and get others to become addicted to playing, exploring, building etc! 

Daily users grow = more corporate investment = higher valuation

I know that many parcels currently sit empty, so I thought that this is an opportunity to offer something unique for invested users to place on their land. The design uses only 4,415 polygons, so you have a healthy allowance to customize the interior and make it your own—turn it into your own social hangout or NFT gallery, if you wish! For those interested in seeing the model in-game, I've placed it on one of my lands [here](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-43,20). I'm happy to listen to any feedback or answer any questions about the process or the NFT itself =:)

Edit: Holy guacamole, Batman! 4 already sold and only #4/5 remains. Thank you, whoever you are, my humble purchaser(s).

The entire foundation of Decentraland is built in Mana. People use Mana to buy NFTs in game. Once Mana has transactions that work on the sidechain I would go so far as to argue that Mana is now insanely more valuable for purchasing NFTs than Ethereum itself. Look their is a simple reason Greyscale continues to purchase more Mana and that's that they see long term potential in the coin.,gu52q8r,2021-04-11 11:59:15,PCgaming4ever,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mo5jsu/atari_creates_a_division_for_blockchain_and_nft/gu52q8r/,2,0,,2,0,mo5jsu,comment

decentraland,PSA: Decentraland is not a game.,"I see a lot of confused new investors wondering why this ""game"" is pumping. It is not a game. It is nothing like axies.

It is a metaverse. 

Meaning, most of what is going on is not in the 3d ""game world"" rather it is the representation of the community development. Most of the interaction going on isn't in dcl itself. A lot of it is through a multitude of discords and social media. 

Yea, there are events which are a great way to meet fellow investors, artists, programmers and everything else looking to collaborate on projects together. But you have to look beyond the low poly graphics and low ""player"" count. 

Its a place where you can make friends, colleagues, and some of the coolest people from all over the world. 

Its a place where you can get hired, hire people, or just collaborate on anything from smart contracts, NFTs, or games that earn passive income. Just take a look at some of the successful people and organizations from DG, metazone, ethermon, wonderzone, etc. 

It took me a solid month of scratching my head wondering wtf am i looking at until it all clicked for me. Decentraland isnt about speculation of MANA. Its a decentralized blank canvas of digital space. Its whatever you want it to be if you have the skill.

decentraland,Can we please shut up about prices in the sub.,"Decentraland is more than a token you got lucky with. 
This sub is great for helping new users navigate and learn the metaverse. But unfortunately, after sending a user here to try and get a feel for it and learn what's out there, they actually quit playing bc the talk about money and MANA just annoyed them, and after looking for help, all that was available was a scammer looking to have said person ""verify their wallet.""

I've been messing around in Decentraland since day 1. And as happy as I am to see the current numbe of users, I am broken hearted to see the obsession with price. 

The amount of work that went into Decentraland is actually insane. I remember when there was hardly anything there, but we slowly saw things get built.

MANA is not meant to be HODL'd it is meant to be used. 
It is meant to buy in game items, property, gamble, etc..
Alternatively,  $DG... The Decentra games token, is designed to be held. It's stake able, stable, and a governance token. 

So, please.  If your here to talk about how happy you are with the price, but have never even been into the metaverse behind it, then please take the money speculative posts elsewhere.",qls1e2,2021-11-03 11:03:49,TheRealNotaredditor,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qls1e2/can_we_please_shut_up_about_prices_in_the_sub/,153,0,147,153,2,qls1e2,post

decentraland,"Decentraland Clinic - Clinic.Dcl.Eth 68,-89","Hello Decentraland,

We are a group of friends who are all work in the medical field as our regular jobs.  We want to open the first clinic in Decentraland to provide medical and mental health advice for users on the blockchain all over the world.  We seek to increase health awareness and literacy, from the mindset that healthcare is a human right, not a commodity. 

We will be scheduling meetings with users and setting up a weekly consultation time slot with our Doctors.  So far the in game audio is not good enough from what we have tested, so it will be text based consultations.  This will be free of charge as we are a non-profit group just trying to help out fellow blockchain users who need some advice.

Please contact us at [DecentralandClinic@gmail.com](mailto:DecentralandClinic@gmail.com) for any appointments, further details or questions.

We are still hashing everything out within the game so please be patient with us.

68,-89 on the map.

Friendly reminder that healthy subreddit activity is going to drive more people to DCL. Make engaging posts regularly. Comment and reply, share the sub when you see relevant discussion elsewhere in the crypto space. 

Encourage frequent activity amongst other users and make a point to reply and upvote your peers. Why? That will encourage others to chime in. And it’s also just the nice thing to do.

decentraland,,I’ll look forward to buying more when a dip occurs. Long time hodler with XLM. I remember debating purchasing MANA when it was in the 0.20’s not long ago. It has a strong correlation with XLM but I still was a little hesitant. Noticed the climb and bought in at 0.57 which has given me a nice gain for today. Overall Decentraland is a great product and I was intrigued from the start. Kicking myself just a lil for not buying more but when the time comes again I’ll certainly do so. I’ll be a long term hodler with it too.

I’d hold r/mana no doubt but if you are doing short term moves then r/MATIC looks to be the next one to be gaining momentum (and fast). Good news is by buying r/MATICnetwork you are still supporting decentraland. Mana is one of the few available on Coinbase. So that’s why it got a juicy pump.

decentraland,Pros/Cons of Atari Event,"I think as a community of DCL supporters we should have an honest discussion of the recent Atari event by listing pros and cons. 

To be honest,  I was more disappointed than blown away. There was a lot of hype about a new casino and having a influencer who could bring in big numbers. This could have been the catalyst that propels dcl into the main stream. But what actually happened was a server that couldn’t handle 1200 users, glitchy music, high gas fees, and the same old casino games for dg. 

People are saying it shows potential but that’s a pretty low bar to set. Developers need to step it up. It would be nice if they could update the road map and be more transparent with where this project is heading.",n1hqb1,2021-04-29 23:56:37,EstablishmentWrong98,[],/r/decentraland/comments/n1hqb1/proscons_of_atari_event/,145,0,108,145,0,n1hqb1,post

decentraland,,"100% disappointment here. 

I got into Decentraland/MANA about 2 months ago and literally this event has been the most hyped thing since I've been following the project. 

I was expecting Atari slot machines, perhaps some Atari games you could gamble on, just SOMETHING more than what is ALREADY IN THE FRICKING WORLD. 

On top of that, I played some blackjack for the fun of it last night and lost literally 19 out of the 20 hands that I played. I'm sure the odds are fair and all. I've played enough BJ in my day to know you can just get that unlucky sometimes but it was definitely a kick in the balls on top of the casino itself being very weak. 

Unless they do a major upgrade, I will not be returning.",gwdtyt2,2021-04-30 03:33:15,DogGuy23,[],/r/decentraland/comments/n1hqb1/proscons_of_atari_event/gwdtyt2/,19,0,,19,0,n1hqb1,comment

decentraland,,"I agree. But you're looking at this the wrong way. DCLs true potential is limited to Ethereums performance. It will always be bottled neck by ETH. High gas fees? ETH, performance? ETH, sure there is a bunch of awesome and creative things developers can do with the current tech. But all in all, nothing will change till ETH is better (with sharding/side chains) or they switch to a higher performaning chain (EOS, Polkadot, Tezos, WAX, etc)

Put it this way, MMORPGs like WoW, Runescape, EVE online COULDNT operate on dial up internet speeds. 

Same applies here, how is DCL supposed to become more immersive when the tech on ETH is slow and lacklustre.

Something I've been ranting about for a long time, 
MANA's price in inflated, stupid money is here. Traders have a hold of this thing. 

The price of mana is outperforming land itself... think about that for a moment... it's stupid..
I have both mana and land and even though I profit from this I hate the price. New comers can't even claim a name without paying over $100.... when I first started in DCL claiming a name was under $10.  
These issues are the biggest barriers to DCL atm.",gwe7hnl,2021-04-30 06:05:16,Sly-Raccoon,[],/r/decentraland/comments/n1hqb1/proscons_of_atari_event/gwe7hnl/,12,0,,12,0,n1hqb1,comment

decentraland,,To the people saying this is bad for Mana did you read the article or even understand how a sidechain network works?  This is a network: Polygon’s Matic Network it's not a coin You transfer your mana to that network to do that transaction through USING MANA.,gt1jnnk,2021-04-01 15:52:00,PCgaming4ever,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mhv5ug/big_news_today/gt1jnnk/,13,0,,13,0,mhv5ug,comment
decentraland,,"I think a few people are still confused so...

Currently when you buy something on Decentraland you pay the asking price in MANA + ETH gas fee's

example: RTFKT Atari sneakers 350 MANA + $50 ETH gas fee = $400

Once the Matic network is fully incorporated ""expect to see this coming May"" according to this article, it will be just 350 MANA = $350. No gas fee

This will lead to much more sales",gt1uj74,2021-04-01 17:13:29,Grromph,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mhv5ug/big_news_today/gt1uj74/,14,0,,14,0,mhv5ug,comment

decentraland,,"To everyone unfamiliar with Matic;

It is a side/child chain in eth. It has smart contract functionality and many apps on eth already use matic as an option or alternative to save a TON of money on fees. 

Matic works similarly to eth but was designed with proof of stake and plasma mechanisms from the git-go. 

For example, compare uniswap to quickswap. I can do all the same trades and liquidity provisions as uni, but for fractions of a cent and lightning fast confirmation. 

So the reason to own matic is to secure the netowkr and earn rewards via staking. But not necessary to use mana on matic!

This will be a HUGE improvement to Mana in both speed and fees.",gt29y8m,2021-04-01 19:10:13,ETHcited,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mhv5ug/big_news_today/gt29y8m/,3,0,,3,0,mhv5ug,comment

decentraland,,"Im new to crypto, found Mana and am going mostly all-in on it precisely because it has something other altcoins don't: an attached space that people can associate with it. 99% of people don't know anything about blockchains or networks or any of that shit. People know virtual spaces and parcels of land. It's fun to explore areas.

That matters *a ton*. It's (kind of) tangible (ie explorable), familiar in a way to gamers, but unique in the crypto world. *Regardless of the uncertainties of what the future holds (ad space, casinos, lounges, marketplaces, puzzles, crafting workshops, battlefields, etc), people gravitate towards familiar things that stand out*. That gives it a certain momentum. 

The more developers begin to wring out what's possible in this space, the more attractive it becomes and the more momentum it will gain. I feel like an early investor of the video game I've always dreamt of, which, after the past few years of the industry continually churning out shit and destroying games that I love (all while I have precisely ZERO say in the process), it gets me pumped to see such a system forming.

Fuck the moon. To the stars!

decentraland,,"The term ""Metaverse"" comes from Neal Stephenson's book ""Snow Crash."" There he has characters called ""Gargoyles"" who are plugged into the metaverse 24/7. They become useless in the real world, as they always have an eye on what's happening in the virtual one, meaning all real world interaction, such as conversation becomes all but impossible with them. They are in some ways, permanently distracted by their addiction. Stephenson recently commented on this, saying that seeing so many people hunched over their phones, plugged into social media, is beginning to prove his point. Presently he worries that an algorithm hides stuff we don't want to see, creating a perfect world within our own bubble. In the multiverse, if you don't want to see black people, gays, Jews, children, then with the press of a button you, too, can create your own perfect environment. It's easy to imagine people being happier in there.",hld3ptq,2021-11-20 07:57:13,Putapest,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qxxzpc/all_hype_and_excitement_aside_anyone_actually/hld3ptq/,6,0,,6,0,qxxzpc,comment

decentraland,,"I'm not saying Grayscale would tell Decentraland anything... I was saying Grayscale would dump their MANA position if anything were to come out in regards to regulation/compliance for there being online gambling platforms within the world. 

If the US government wasn't cool with there being online gambling within Decentraland they can go after financial institutions that offer MANA to their customers. And as we saw with XRP neither Grayscale or Coinbase are going to stand up to fight it. They will just say ""oh ok"" dump it and move on. 

XRP is a perfect example. All it took was the threat of legal action for both of those companies to ditch it. Grayscale sold all their XRP in a single swoop and coinbase delisted them. They haven't even lost the legal battle yet or been charge with anything.

XRP themselves got in some hot water with US regulators and coinbase proactively chose to delist them (no one made them as far as I know).

I'm not saying I predict this to happen -- but if US regulators wanted to go after Decentraland for whatever reason, I'm sure the coinbases/Grayscales of the world would prefer to play it safe and just remove the ties to the project.

decentraland,,"Also, I think the amount of users is a factor right now. I had no clue about DCL six months ago, and haven’t seen any kind of news about it outside of Coinbase and this subreddit. Once (if) a lot of people actually start using DCL I expect to see some attempt at regulation, especially if it generates the kind of revenue it has the potential to in the future. I think the best course of action right now is to focus on development, lowering gas prices, and having in world price reflect mana or eth directly. I think this has a lot of potential though, but kinda needs to stay an “open secret” while it builds a steady user base. Two years DCL will either bust or boom imho.

decentraland,,"Yes, that is definitely a good point - target the device where your core audience is. But I think you are wrong about this audience.There is a problem here: What is this young generation going to do in decentraland?

**If we compare decentraland to roblox, then lets have a look some things:**

Roblox: Complete nocode editing and creation possibilities, free to do many things

Decentraland: Typescript SDK, not free to create, have to pay either land or rent - which is both very expensive. I know guys spending 200bucks renting two parcels.Why this cannot change it obvious: You cannot make something cheap in an enviroment that largely exists because its traded for high amounts of money. Can you see a ""landlord"" rent out parcels for pennies a month? Nope, that would devalue the 15k he just paid...

So the part where you actually have fun creating and sharing stuff falls flat.But if there is no content..why am I gonna buy wearables? ( and do we think a younger audience is paying 50bucks for a hat, or 100bucks to publish a wearable that requires like blender to create?

It results in a 20k daily active in dcl, versus 140 Million in Roblox. People dont just do something because its there, they do something because its cool and worthwhile their time. DCL has been in the press since a year now, yet there has little been happening. How many new game experiences did roblox get in the same timespan? Thousands.

Here comes a thought:Keep dcl in its niche where it obviously caters to a very specific need.Gambling, flipping land, nfts. And that is totally fine.

With the current system, it is not laid out to become something like roblox. No vr, mobile or whatever are going to change that anytime soon.",hwidhhy,2022-02-11 14:51:20,Decentrabro2000,[],/r/decentraland/comments/sppmpk/when_is_decentraland_going_to_get_a_mobile_app_i/hwidhhy/,5,0,,5,0,sppmpk,comment

Don't get my wrong, I think Mana will continue to see some solid gains for the next 1-2 years, but it's crucial that in this time Decentraland be receiving MASSIVE updates/upgrades. The game is currently way outdated. It's not enough to just say the Metaverse is the future and be perfectly content with the current state. Watching Decentraland and Sandbox right now IMO is a bit like watching two fat kids get a 5 second head start in an Olympic sprint. All it will take is much better constructed projects to show up (which lets face it, won't be hard to do vs the current iteration of Metaverse) for Mana to become worthless because it's unusable outside of Decentraland.

decentraland,,"You're missing the fundamentals and ethos decentraland is built on. Graphics and experiences will come but first you need a rock solid foundation.

Any company can build a VR experience that has dope graphics and games from the get go. Look at half life alyx, GTA V, fortnite, facebook horizon etc whatever. These projects however are owned by companies, stored on centralized servers, and governed/censored by laws.

Instead of starting with the experience, decentraland built the framework for an open source, user owned, decentrally stored, and community governed platform first.

Users own the platform. Content is stored and maintained on community owned servers. Development is loosely driven by a DAO governance system. And the project/content can't ever be taken down or killed as long as the code is open-source on github.

As the storage network grows and the desktop client is released, render speeds will improve and constraints on building will lessen meaning better, higher quality content and experiences.",hpu6ezy,2021-12-24 19:06:44,rarama,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rns052/metaverse_will_be_a_thing_but_this_aint_it_this/hpu6ezy/,128,0,,128,1,rns052,comment

decentraland,,"The Metaverse doesn't need one company....that's the thing. The Metaverse will come from a need to share communications and assets between subverses. 

Right now that need is strongly linked with our sense of identity and how we outwardly represent ourselves. Our Avatars have a strong link to us, and our fashion drives the need to share resources between platforms. 

Trying to do that under on roof would be a logistical nightmare. When one system changes, the other ones necessarily have to change. Enter Blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts. NFTs are a simple idea and solution to this problem, and yet they are only a simple contract. There is potential for the NFT alone - but I suspect there will be more at play soon.

decentraland,,"True.

Not anyone can have kick ass Art. Once you’ve got the wrong kind of Art and team that made it, it’s nearly impossible and very costly to pívot to a different style. I know that from experience. 

When developing games, Story comes first, then Art, then Gameplay Design, Economy , Back-end, Community, etc. IMO

I invest in both Decentraland and Sandbox (I believe in the space), but sadly I don’t see them having a unique story, attractive art or engaging gameplay, any time soon. These Metaverse “games” are more like social media at this stage - reminiscent of 1990s chat rooms and Habbo.

They’re missing the core 3 hooks that games use for engagement: story, art, gameplay. 

They don’t have a beating heart. Yet. 

It’s very risky launching something heartless- coz what if you never find the heart and soul of the game/metaverse? 

An Open World with tons of branded content can ONLY work if you have a kick ass core game mechanic… otherwise, after a while users will feel like they’re just being sold to- and have nothing purposeful to do. and “mini games” (eg. Slot machine in the casino sector) don’t count!",hpuv0po,2021-12-24 22:26:49,sebcoman,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rns052/metaverse_will_be_a_thing_but_this_aint_it_this/hpuv0po/,0,0,,0,0,rns052,comment

While waiting for the averse to become a thing surely we can enjoy the time of development. With the recent Metaverse narrative, there are lot of projects providing great APY.  
Just today I found a project that just launched bonded staking with insane APY of 70%.  
I always find the projects with good fundamentals tho as I do not feel the want to be rugged.

My most recent find is Meta Game Hub Dao, I love this new project. They are a very trustworthy team with notable partnerships like $SAND $MANA $LINK.  
Together with $LINK and Opensea they are collecting valuation data on Land transactions and summarize it into a valuation tool driven by reliable data.  
So they have also recently launched locked as well as flexible staking and either option provide at least 40% APR. Very happy with that.

All that said, I think FB will either scoop up DCL like The Borg and “assimilate” it (resistance is futile) or they will crush it. Those are the only two options.

decentraland,,"It’s on a peer-to-peer network. Each machine in the network acts like a client and server at the same time. Ordinary client-server architectures are centralized because the data is stored on the server side. In a peer-to-peer network, each machine is a client and a server so the clients all have the same data, thus decentralized and distributed. Block chain technology works on the peer-to-peer architecture. Typically node operators store the data and well distributed block chains will have thousands of nodes across the globe. These node operators typically earn coins through fees by giving up their hardware resources for the network. Depending on the blockchain, there may be multiple types of nodes that serve different purposes.",hpvafuk,2021-12-25 00:48:26,Saxbonsai,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rns052/metaverse_will_be_a_thing_but_this_aint_it_this/hpvafuk/,4,0,,4,0,rns052,comment

decentraland,,"Hi, I’m the person who wrote that blogpost about High Fidelity. I’ve been blogging for 4-1/2 years about social VR, virtual worlds and the metaverse, visiting and writing about over 150 platforms in that time: https://ryanschultz.com/list-of-social-vr-virtual-worlds/. There’s a LOT out there already!

I’ve written a fair bit about four crypto/blockchain virtual worlds that have an actual platform which you can currently visit as an avatar: NeosVR, Cryptovoxels, Decentraland, and Somnium Space. I’m on the fence about blockchain, only owning some NCR because I earn them as a Patreon supporter oh Neos (which, by the way, is doing some insanely creative things on their platform).  

Metaverse platforms do NOT have to have a blockchain component (although many of the posts by people selling products on this subreddit might make you think otherwise). For example, Second Life, at the ripe old age of 18, has about the same number of concurrent users on an average day as VRChat and Rec Room. SL is the perfect example of a mature, fully-evolved metaverse that newer platforms would be wise to study and learn lessons from. 

The current hothouse atmosphere of blockchain-based “metaverse” platforms since Facebook became Meta has frankly gotten a bit out of hand. Please make sure that you all your due diligence before investing a penny in any crypto/blockchain/NFT project! MetaWorld should be a warning to everybody, Engadget recently wrote up an investigation into the project here: https://www.engadget.com/metaworld-nft-metaverse-dedric-reid-clubhouse-discord-170052007.html

Decentraland had the great good fortune of a perfectly timed ICO, and made a lot of money. An early promotional video made it look like it would support VR but that did not come to pass.

decentraland,,"It’s not so much the currency but the idea of a virtual world where literally anything is possible. Ngl I originally bought the coin because of the name but after reading into the project and theory crafting how much potential can come from it I’m sold on it. 


You can have a shop in the real world, put up a store front in DCL and people can view your products and buy them. Even if you don’t have them buy it in game and just link your website for purchasing with fiat is huge. 

Imagine the fashion industry gets into this: make wearables as NFT people can buy in game AND also put a link to your store so they can buy it in real life. 

Imagine the delivery food industry gets in: Pizza Hut has an in game store, you’re playing the casino and get hungry, just walk over to the Hut and order a pizza and delivered to your house. 

Imagine the education system gets involved: TED style talks, interactions with major universities where they can offer discounted or free lectures to drive people to their school. 

Imagine the mental health industry gets involved: psychiatrists and therapists can set up private rooms and if going out in public makes you anxious or talking about your issues to a real human feels weird then you can talk to someone in a private setting and since it’s avatar to avatar it makes it easier and you can get the help you need. 

Imagine the entertainment industry gets involved: movie screenings, interviews with actors, cons could be hosted. 

Literally the possibilities are endless and let’s be real: with the name MANA as your currency you’re gonna draw gamers and then they’ll be like me and hooked on the idea. Lol",gqarjoi,2021-03-09 05:32:42,r3dxv1rus,[],/r/decentraland/comments/m0sod7/_/gqarjoi/,1,0,,1,0,m0sod7,comment

decentraland,,"The blockchain aspect is needed to prove ownership of anything you buy in game such as wearables, land, cars, artwork etc. Same concept as why would I buy digital art vs a real painting I can showcase in my real house? If I buy a shirt from the DCL shop for my avatar then the blockchain allows me to own it and then sell as I see fit. The casino aspect is what really got my attention with blockchain implementation. Since everything is on the chain you can see that games are being fair and not rigged against the player as every bet and payout is recorded for the public. 

The theories I put correlating classes and food delivery chains is under the assumption that when people log into DCL they’re doing so for the social aspect. You’re right that people aren’t going to load up DCL just to order a pizza, but if your immersed and playing with friends in a mini game or at the casino you could just be like, “Hey guys wanna order some food together?” and head over, chat outside while you’re waiting and then enjoy a meal together shooting the shit or continue back at your blackjack table or whatever you were doing. 

I guess in summary I see two different ways that people and companies can use DCL. There’s everything that can be built upon with blockchain technology and also real world applications. It’s still very much in infancy but as more people hear about it and land gets developed and there’s more to interact with I personally see endless opportunities.",gqavksh,2021-03-09 06:24:25,r3dxv1rus,[],/r/decentraland/comments/m0sod7/_/gqavksh/,1,0,,1,0,m0sod7,comment

I agree that the most convincing aspect of it is the gambling. It's in tune with the mindset of the majority in the crypto space. The pumps are what really excite people still and it's very incentive driven in that sense. 
For the moment I can't see past the novelty value of NFTs. The legal aspects of it seem too mind boggling too. For the moment...
I do however find the idea of developing land in a public virtual space to have new expressive potential. However I sort of doubt the platform would compute smoothly if say a million people logged in. For one, they wouldn't be populating the same instance and so would miss each other.

decentraland,,"If you want to trade look for technical analysis tools. Look at the most popular indicators RSI, MACD ect. 

Only invest money if you can live without it for at least 2 years. If you don’t need it, you don’t need to pull it out when / if it’s down. 

Think about where this can go. More partnerships, advances in tech (VR, Mobile, graphics, features) research timeframes for those major milestones and wait it out. 

After you invest, don’t keep looking at it everyday your emotions will take over and you will want to sell at the wrong time. Invest some, and look for other opportunities.

decentraland,,"True but you have to look at the long term. In 3 to 5 years there’s going to be 1 million Nft projects with the 10,000 club concept. Here is virtual land that only 90,000 parcels in the world(thousands are being brought up by institutions like the Mets owner and Cuban talked about plans)

There will be other meta-verse projects but I honestly think we’re the gold standard. If it’s in a good location once there’s more awareness about how virtual land works,The price will be exponentially higher

Having mana is fine. I’m just personally an nft guy and plan on selling my land in a few years as a WWE museum in a good district for way more than I invested.

I still hold mana(any traditional investor would call me nuts for the amount I have dedicated to mana/land)

I just really believe in the project I’ve been following it since it’s infancy and I don’t think many out there come close to what we have accomplished.

decentraland,,"So I had bitcoin back in 2015 but I gambled away.. then a year went by I wasn’t paying attention and it had exploded. This was probably the end of 2016 maybe early 2017. So I started looking for a new coins.

I was looking up and down the list and ETH caught my eye. They had Litecoin and Ripped ahead of it. for some reason I thought litecoin was a knock off bitcoin and wasn’t going to do good and rip all just seemed shady because the banks were cool with it in the beginning.

Ethereum was doing other things so when it was around 600 I put a good bit into it. This was back when you could buy almost any crypto. So I saw Decentraland and it really caught my eye. I followed the coins closely but since I wasn’t working and relying on social couldn’t invest really.

Earlier last year I got a job and began putting all of my money into crypto. To answer your question I look at market cap upside,uniqueness and if they are expendable .

That being said my clear number one in my portfolio is Mana. I am over invested by technical terms but I just believe in it too much. Anyway about 35% of my portfolio is ETH. 25% MANA. 20%Chainlink 10%Matic and the other 10% I move around depending on announcements and trends

Now if I factor in what I put into my land,mana is roughly 60% of the portfolio and if I factor in what my land is worth it’s probably 80% mana lol.

But yes I have the same philosophy with all of my coins/NFTs and think you would do great if you bought in this order.

3.LINK

I would seriously consider buying land if you have the liquidity. It is considered an NFT and even though it might seem overpriced(3.3 ETH floor) it’s not even getting started.

Soon it will be at a 10 ETH floor. Make sure you install a wallet for your NFTs and if you have any questions about buying them ask me.

Finally, our market cap is still only 7.5B. Shiba is around 30B. That being said we have so much room to grow because we are better than a lot of projects that have Market caps 10x ours.

decentraland,Bill Gates saying 3D metaverses are the next big thing,"""Within the next two or three years, I predict most virtual meetings will move from 2D camera image grids—which I call the *Hollywood Squares* model, although I know that probably dates me—to the metaverse, a 3D space with digital avatars. Both Facebook and Microsoft recently unveiled their visions for this, which gave most people their first view of what it will look like.

The idea is that you will eventually use your avatar to meet with people in a virtual space that replicates the feeling of being in an actual room with them. To do this, you’ll need something like VR goggles and motion capture gloves to accurately capture your expressions, body language, and the quality of your voice. Most people don’t own these tools yet, which will slow adoption somewhat. (One of the things that enabled the rapid change to video meetings was the fact that many people already had PCs or phones with cameras.) Microsoft plans to roll out an interim version next year, which uses your webcam to animate an avatar that’s used in the current 2D set-up.

There are a ton of companies working on 3D avatars, and I recently had the opportunity to test out some of their prototypes. I was super impressed by what I saw.""

decentraland,,"Hi guys,

I designed the Zen Cabin as a simple minimalist space  ready to be placed on a 1x1 Decentraland parcel. It is available to purchase on [Mintable](https://www.mintable.app/u/radium)

It offers a subtle blend of intimatacy and transparency and adelicate mix between a traditional archetype and a modern contemporary form.The Zen Cabin has an inner patio for meditation and quietnesss where you can place a little garden or your favorite NFT.  The interior walls can also act as an art gallery. The large window that projects outside offers a pink filtered view of your Decentraland neighbourhood

The unlockable content includes the .glb file ready to be uploaded on your Decentraland parcel.

&#x200B;

Edit : I am excited to announce that the Zen Cabin #1 has been sold ! 

I think i will issue a limited edition of 5 to 10 items during next days.

Also I will  start working on other designs.

decentraland,,"I should preface this by saying I just took a heroic dose of about 7 grams of psilocybin mushrooms.  Will DCL evolve into a true metaverse is the million dollar question, isn't it?  Are we going to have a simulated world soon that people can use to defy the laws of time and space that govern the physical one?  I think, like most things related to technological advancement, the answer is a bit complicated, with alot of nuances to it.  First, full immersion into a vr space is not going to happen suddenly- there will be intermediary steps along the way that gradually lead to the final leap.  For right now, AR is much more practical, portable, and soon to become much more affordable.  This will probably come in the form of some kind of glasses/haptic glove device which connects more and more to physical objects.  6g + IOT is the magical formula.  Essentially, this will lay the groundwork for an entire simulation of the physical world as well as creative worlds that come out of our imaginations.  Read David Kelly of Wired Magazine's article on the Mirror World for reference.  

So what is DCL's role in this?  Well, like many in this group, I instantly was hooked on the metaverse concept, even before Ready Player One.  It just makes sense.  Humans have created great wealth in the physical world, but they also have created great Illth.  Greed and fear, evolutionary resting points, have brought humanity to the brink of self-destruction.  The thing that is our root cause of suffering- the ego consciousness- is also syptomatic of planetary growing pains.  We build technology with Promethean ambition in order to alleviate our suffering, but this technology creates great power and responsibility that few among us have the ability to wield wisely.  If one observes closesly, as in the traditions of Oriental philosophy and Western mysticism, every thing has consciousness in it, however dim.  The mineral world is alive, the vegetative one even more so, and the animal kingdom is the most intelligent (consciousness IS intelligence).  Our planet is ""waking up"", and beginning to become self aware.  The human brain and nervous system is it's current most advanced communication and information system.  As Nietzsche said, man is a bridge from one world to the next.  This is the message of all sages and philosophers, in fact, from Plato, Buddha, Jesus, Tesla, and beyond.  Our physical body and mental hardware have the limitations placed upon them by Mother Earth.  But our minds, as has been proven scientifically in the modern discovery of the quantum field, are limitlessly connected to the Great Cosmic Mind.  To simulate our universe is the next leap into interplanetary self-realization.

DCL, in it's current incarnation, is still very, very primitive.  The concept is flawless but the execution is still very cumbersome.  It's difficult to navigate and find things quickly.  There still are only a relatively low number of people online at any time.  But most of all, it still doesn't feel like a remotely authentic experience, such as one would encounter with the Rift or Hive.  To create the illusion of reality is the trick, because, as anyone of The Matrix's cult followers will tell you:  what do we even mean by ""reality"" anyway?  It's just by consensus agreement amongst us that we say this is ""real"" or that is not. Quantum physicists and Zen masters agree:  when you observe the nature of things with concentrated effort, you end up like the proverbial dog wagging it's tail.  There is ""no-thing"" there.  Only patterns and patterns of energy that are interconnected and form the matrix by their relationship to one another.  What our modern digital age is doing is reverse engineering the human experience of consciousness, so it only goes without saying that we will live in more and more recursively simulated universes.  I am encouraged by the noble aspirations of DCL, am an investor, and will keep my nervous system wide open to measure their progress and the progress in general of the development of metaverses.  As Amazon and Google use internet technology but don't own it, so DCL and the Ethereum network use blockchain technology but don't own it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that told me which ones were going to make it, but I am reasonably optimistic DCL will play a large role in our transformation of planetary consciousness.

decentraland,,"Another fun architecture x DCL project—the *Gambit's Pavilion*—for you guys is releasing on June 1st via an OpenSea auction as a limited #1/1 NFT. Just shy of 100 hours went into the design, development, 3D rendering, soundtrack, and minting of this project and the winner of the pavilion auction will also receive the matching #1/1 *Gambit's Set* as a separate, unique NFT.

The project is 16m x 16m in size and comes in at just over 6,000 triangles with colliders included. The unlockable .GLB file can easily be placed on your 1x1 (or larger) parcel of land using the native [Decentraland Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) with no coding required. All bids made during this week-long auction will be offset by 200% of their estimated carbon footprint in support of the [McCloud River Conservation Forest Management Project](https://dashboard.cloverly.com/sustainability-report/archonomousf389e7) making this a carbon-positive event. As always, I'm more than happy to answer any questions you guys have about the design/development process, what's included, or the auction itself. Below are a few links to learn more about this release—

It's a multiplayer soccer game, called Moonshot, I made last July and held a 'Crypto World Cup' tournament with 24 teams from various crypto companies!

It's not a finished product, which, for me, is kinda the point. If it were, it wouldn't be worth buying, as it would have reached its stable value. The greater the risk the greater the reward.

I've got a surface pro 4 with 8 Gigs of ram and don't have a problem running it in low performance mode. What took 2 hours? Did you need to install Metamask or something?

decentraland,,"I think this is fair - and probably a common experience. I can say that over the past few months of exploring decentraland, I have found genuine ""entertainment"" a few times. The Wall St Bets takeover was great to explore for an hour or so, with some decent humour in the scene decor and some interesting challenges, but mostly it's been live music events, topped out by the Metaverse Festival which was brilliant and by some margin the best Metaverse event I have seen.

I think the reality is that for the most part, it simply isn't ready yet, we are all early. In the DeFi space this means complicated Dapps that sometimes get hacked, in the Metaverse space this means low res graphics, shaky performance, lack of full VR, limited scene building tools for the layman, and generally underdeveloped spaces. 

My advice would be set low expectations for now, and enjoy watching the space evolve over the next few years.",hk4grgu,2021-11-10 21:56:06,supertyler,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qr2shw/unpopular_opinion_just_spent_3h_playing/hk4grgu/,68,0,,68,0,qr2shw,comment

Wannabe rent seeking, on the other hand, is easy. Just buy insanely over-priced land and wait around in the hope that someone will pay you to use it.

IMO DCL is more of a event driven social game but if you are into mini games there are fun games created by people/teams but sadly usually lasting during the time of the event, like the xmas games, or the Wonderquest quest 1 for example where team created their NFT collection and as a promotion they created a really fun (and hard) puzzle game to solve in their temple.",hk4ube6,2021-11-10 23:29:41,Nicic,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qr2shw/unpopular_opinion_just_spent_3h_playing/hk4ube6/,5,0,,5,0,qr2shw,comment

We built it during the first few hackathons/gamejams and we were all just learning the SDK and trying to build something with the tools we had at the time. The games that came out didn't really focus on replayability, and you'd usually just try everything once and never again.   


I enjoyed the public launch of decentraland a lot. The content was based around all the games that were created during the gamejams with treasure chests/rewards for completing the mini-games. The main reason it was so enjoyable was because of the rewards! you could find wearables, mana and even LAND (if you were one of the first people to find all 50 or so chests) When you strip away the rewards, these non-replayable games are kinda boring.   


Now we're focusing on creating more replayable content, and as some people mentioned here, Interaction with other players is going to be important in making things more enjoyable and fun.",hk7764j,2021-11-11 13:28:15,Lew_WZ,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qr2shw/unpopular_opinion_just_spent_3h_playing/hk7764j/,3,0,,3,0,qr2shw,comment

decentraland,,"I have gone through cycles on this. Ultimately I have decided that land is the value play for me. If MANA were somehow an exclusive in world currency it would appeal more, but the easy availability of other tokens within DCL - which is absolutely necessary - diminishes the long term case for mana for me. The role of MANA is really limited to DAO voting rights (which land also provides), so in a roundabout way MANA is sort of a second class asset, one which does not have the added value of land rights. If buying mana, i see this as closer to a pure play investment in DCL DAO governance rights, and whilst the market does not reflect this yet, someone with more time (or just smarter than me) might actually compute the relative minimum cost of voting rights obtained through either land or mana, and work out whether voting rights can be increased by switching between the two. In theory the value of land should reflect the value of the underlying governance voting rights plus a premium for the land itself, whilst MANA should simply reflect the value of the underlying voting rights. This was probably a much more complicated answer than you were hoping for.",hkcaqhf,2021-11-12 15:22:59,supertyler,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qr2shw/unpopular_opinion_just_spent_3h_playing/hkcaqhf/,3,0,,3,0,qr2shw,comment

decentraland,MANA token onchain analysis. Price prediction based on whales wallets movements,"MANA token price is $ 1.96 today. It is 67% below the ATH which was $ 5.85 on November 25. Since then, the price has been in a strong downtrend. Decentraland held above the $ 3 line for a long time, but recent market events have brought the price down below the $ 2 mark.  

https://preview.redd.it/1zblqull9wd81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0707c49cb0a245e9b6e28be58e1e35f5fc9f313

Let's start the analysis of portfolio charts with a general summary of addresses above $ 5k. We can see that the trend is increasing. The number of wallets was 4,931 on the day when all time high was done, then increased to 5,195 from December 23, and has been going down slightly since then. This chart will always show the sentiment of the market. As we can see, the greatest euphoria is behind us. The situation on the market and the recent declines in BTC certainly contribute to this. However, this is not a significant decline, which allows you to remain optimistic for a trend reversal.  

https://preview.redd.it/6l1kj6in9wd81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a2a1dd6e66dc8a669cfc3ea12f79cf11d1b890

Among the larger portfolios above $ 100k, we see a halt in gains in a similar period, but they have not been declining noticeably in recent days. You can see that larger investors are more confident in their investments and are not selling out yet.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gxt05ovo9wd81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d555b4d1868f556a8f8fe9c559447df2076c458

The largest portfolios above $ 1M show an accumulation that started at the time of the recent market downturn. You can see here that whales see a great chance in the low price of the MANA token.

Now let's see what the specific ranges of whale wallets look like. Let us define a whale as an entity with min. 0.005% of market capitalization. For Decentraland, addresses above $ 139k in value. We analyze the graphs on a linear scale to better observe the differences between the ranges.

Let's start with the 150k - 250k USD range. Here we see a strong increase near ATH time and then a slow decline.  
• 250k - 500k USD. No clear changes  
• 500k - 1kk USD shows a slight increase.  
• 1kk - 1.5kk USD. Here we can see increases at the beginning of the month and then an equally large decline  
• 1.5kk - 2.5kk USD, some increase in the last 4 days  
• 2.5kk-5kk US, also continued gains.

https://preview.redd.it/6mbqnx7r9wd81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bfd129d6a212b59df9f3e63796b01fa98d993f9

We must remember that if the number of wallets has decreased in some ranges, it may be due to two situations. One is the case where investors have sold tokens and are not included in the analyzed range. The second is the situation when someone bought additional ones and appeared in the results of a higher range. Therefore, the analysis must be carried out collectively and the capital flow should be taken into account.

https://preview.redd.it/1hcqkpjs9wd81.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=016654057e19f208f7f165fb6cd2a82de3dcf6ac

Lets present changes of wallets numbers for each range of whales in the table. However we should analyse exponential moving average of the portfolios. Let's set a 28-day moving average. This will help to better visualize the trend direction. Above examples of chart with exact values for each day and 28-day moving average chart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4nuy69yt9wd81.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=85a8fdd1a863a80af0d93e28b7935962640f51dd

Now let's compare the number of portfolios with the supply movements on them. This will allow us to better understand how whales behave in relation to the Decentraland project in the current market situation. For each range, supply movements are very similar to the changes in the number of portfolios.

https://preview.redd.it/4ag67duu9wd81.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b2715ea117739eeb8ceb2b6a52fb9aded67ebc7

Based on this information, we can determine how much the whales have grown among MANA token holders. We calculate the weighted average of the whale wallet gains, where the weight is the supply in each range.

&#x200B;

On a 30-day scale, the upward trend was 6%. Compared to other altcoins, this is a lot. This value does not clearly guarantee the direction in which the price will go in the coming days. It depends on the sentiment of the whole market and other factors. However, it allows to notice that whales still accumulate MANA tokens. This shows what the potential of the Decentraland project is and how much it can grow in relation to the current price. It gives you some advantage when choosing your investment.",scn8ux,2022-01-25 20:35:31,FollowAltcoins,[],/r/decentraland/comments/scn8ux/mana_token_onchain_analysis_price_prediction/,97,0,25,97,5,scn8ux,post

decentraland,,"Good for you and good luck!

I am in with 124,000 MANA (seriously). We need a few things to happen for big growth -

1. I want to see the Atari / Decentraland partnership launch successfully in May (whenever the launch happens) and bring in a ton of revenue.
2. I want to see the Las Vegas casinos follow by putting their casinos onto Decentraland as a revenue stream.
3. I want to see institutional buy-in. Institutions just seem to be getting into Bitcoin, Ethereum. There is that mind-expanding educational process all of us have had to go through. So, expect a learning lagtime for the general population.

Time will tell but IF Decentraland can deliver (a 'Ready Player One' experience please!), as the various technologies mature, then we might have something really big here!

decentraland,,"Man as per usual friends, I think folks are expecting some bug pump on the launch but I think it’s priced in. With only 10,000 users a week or whatever, the idea that they will all show up and start virtually gambling their real money is kinda super duper niche at the moment. First, be a gambler willing to risk it. Second understand crypto, have crypto, and know what decentraland is. Third, have done all the insane legwork of getting to the point of having signed up and learned about wallets and connected to decentraland etc. fourth now log in and go to Atari casino, then gamble.

There are already casinos in decentraland. The brand name is rad, but it will not exponentially blow out the user base. Degens don’t need crypto to gamble online they can do it with the click of a button and fiat all over the place.

Not saying this to down the runway for the coin I hold some I want it to blow up as a gaming experience but I just don’t think what people expect to happen will happen and sustain. The game needs to grow and grow and grow. One event won’t put it over the tipping point IMO. It takes consistent innovation and growth.

I mean hell you add a FPS element to this or some kind of Minecraft style building of puzzles and self running machines and all that fantastic interesting stuff then charge a mana token to run the machine, sure.

decentraland,Atari Casino launches today!,"# Last month, Atari announced a collection of NFT’s, partnered with hotels and casinos, and launched their own token

The group, which became French in 2003, also plans to build several hotels and open a new kind of online casino. It should also be noted that Atari has already recently entered the cryptocurrency market by offering its own currency, Atari Token.

[Atari Casino Official Launch Date - DecentraNews - Metaverse, MANA, LAND, ETH, NFT's and Crypto News](https://decentra.news/atari-casino-official-launch-date/)

Shortly after its rather successful launch into the digital currency market, Atari announced the opening of a “crypto-casino” on [Decentraland](https://decentra.news/cnbc-releases-a-segment-about-land/), an interactive and open-source virtual reality platform based on the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The principle of the crypto-casino is obviously the same as a traditional casino. Cryptoassets – people with a virtual currency wallet – can gamble their money in virtual casinos without having to convert their dollars or euros.  


>*Join us for the grand opening and launch party of the brand new Atari Casino in Vegas City! With over $10k USD in prizes, free wearables, and a live performance by the legendary Dillion Francis!*  
>  
>*Enjoy Atari-themed games along with blackjack and roulette, while wagering the $ATRI token in addition to $MANA and $DAI. A rare Atari POAP and surprise Dillon Francis NFTs will be available only at the event.*  
>  
>*Come hang out with friends, win some crypto, and celebrate Atari’s partnership with Decentral Games while we party with Dillion Francis and Gerald!*

## Wednesday, April 28 from 08:00 pm to 09:00 pm UTC, on the Metaverse! We will be there!

decentraland,,"If not allowed here please delete.

The Metaverse is hot. Decentraland could be the really big winner. Now just my opinion of course not financial advise 😜.  $Mana, $ENJ and $Sand are the big three for the Metaverse. Zuckerberg is supposed to have bought a huge chunk of land in Decentraland. People are making big bucks 1x or more in less then a month. What happens Thursday? Everyone is bragging at Thanksgiving dinner about all the money they're making in these Metaverse investment. 

Will if cousin so and so the college drop out, drunk loser is doubling his money, so can I. This will start a huge FOMO. People start piling in. The next week back at work the FOMO spreads. More people jump in. Prices are skyrocketing so fast that a corrections hits around 10th of December. Panic sell off for a 5 days to a week. Things slowly start climbing again. By Christmas everyone is in the green feeling good. Now the second wave hits.

Uncle Joe and Grandma Sue are sick and tired of collecting 0.27% interest on their savings account get some help and toss a few thousand into this money machine.

Next big crazy wave going through the first to second week of 2022. After that I'm not sure maybe a long correction.

decentraland,"Until the folks in this subreddit and on DCL are willing to be honest about things like the Atari Casino, DCL will never realize its full potential.","The ""Atari"" casino is a pure cash grab from a company which used to be something impressive but failed to hold onto that relevance as better companies left them in the dust. So many posts on this subreddit are trying to plug this casino as if its so awesome and its a great exposure means for DCL, but the reality is not even close. 

The only thing that even lets you know Atari is involved is the brand name sold to DG, and the shape of the building, which resembles the logo of the company. Walk in, and you will see a dance floor, and casino games that DG already had in world in multiple other casinos. There are no throwbacks to the different consoles or games that made Atari what it was at its peak. You can't play versions of any of the games which put Atari on the map. It was an extremely low effort attempt at a ""hey remember us?"" moment from a dying star.

We have to be honest about the reality and optics of things like this dumpster fire, and the truth is Atari sold its brand name to DG and beyond that put no effort whatsoever into the project. Its exactly the opposite of what we should be wanting from a company trying to make a name for itself in the world. We want companies to go all fucking out, push the boundaries by hiring designers to make their stuff themselves, thats how we will ultimately see what the engine can really handle. Otherwise, how long until Lamar partners with DG, buys a few parcels along all the major roads they can, and then turning them into literal billboards advertising you guessed it, casinos!

*Lamar is an advertising firm that has most of the billboards here in my state of louisiana, but I mean it generically, any ad company could latch onto this and do what I described.
**I am invested in a few smaller projects that are really just people trying new things to see it if works,  and two people making some games that I really like so far, so my involvement in this world goes beyond just being the guy railing against casinos, which I'm sure someone will try to say is the case.
**** Someone I was talking with this about before making this asked me what I personally would like to see in DCL. I would love to see some sort of setup that allowed MIT and other institutions which are always doing really cool things (such as trying to generate stable fusion or creating gecko gloves), to showcase their newest published papers, as well as showing us the fun new things they are working on like the above I mentioned. I think that virtual spaces are critically underappreciated in it ability educate, and I think that DCL could really hit something on the head if they secured  themselves to be known as an educational resource as opposed to a place you can gamble and pay no taxes.

EDIT: I don't know what the sandbox is aside from it being a similar concept sorta to DCL, but I see it being brought up a few times, but this post is in no way trying to get people to look to other options than DCL.",nsaprl,2021-06-04 17:33:58,CloudiusWhite,[],/r/decentraland/comments/nsaprl/until_the_folks_in_this_subreddit_and_on_dcl_are/,87,0,47,87,3,nsaprl,post

decentraland,,"I would have to say that you bought it at the right time.
Hodl your way to $5, you will see a pull back to $4.8 and then a potential run to $5.7 or maybe even $6. (Assuming crypto recovers overall and more interesting news comes out)

Scenario 2: we get a run up to around $4 and go sideways from there until there's progress with the devs, or more news.
Could touch $3.5 or maybe even tickle $3 in the next 4-6 months. Overall, we would see good support at $3",ho0m6wv,2021-12-10 18:25:19,SomeCuriousFellow,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rddin9/just_bought_250_mana_oh_boy/ho0m6wv/,4,0,,4,0,rddin9,comment

decentraland,,"Step into the future of NFTs with **The NFT Booth**.

**FEATURES**

* A billboard system that attracts attention to your NFT from a distance. Automatically appears and disappears based on player proximity.
* Players can click the billboard and be taken to a link of your choice (e.g. Rarible)
* Note that you must provide a link to an image for the billboard (if you like the styling of the one in the preview, I would be happy to generate one for you using that template! – DM me on Twitter u/Cryptonovelist_)
* A futuristic white booth that expands around your NFT when the player approaches, offering unprecedented immersion and focus for your art.
* An artist/gallery owner name introduces the NFT, adding a layer of cinematic flair to the experience.

**CONFIGURATION**

The following options can be modified by owners of the booth:

* nftID (used to specify NFT to display)
* nftContract (used to specify NFT to display)
* fixedNFTURL (Overrides nftID+nftContract: if you want to simply reference an image instead of an NFT – useful for loading hi-res NFTs)
* nftWidth (width of the NFT inside of the booth)
* nftHeight (height of the NFT inside of the booth)
* attractorImageURL (link to a 1000x2300px image that will appear on the billboard)
* attractorLabel (text to display when a player hovers their mouse over the billboard)
* callToActionURL (link to the destination players are taken to after clicking the billboard)
* presenterName (name of the artist that shows up in UI text)
* presenterNameFontSize (used to adjust the size of the UI text)

Finally, please note that the trigger areas used to automatically display/hide the booth/billboard are not configurable. However, the ability to use your own trigger areas in conjunction with the booth will come in a future version. This will enable you to provide more of a tailored experience for your particular parcel/estate.",grd3zyc,2021-03-18 14:35:43,thecryptonovelist,[],/r/decentraland/comments/m7ptsz/launched_a_new_nft_booth_yesterday/grd3zyc/,3,0,,3,0,m7ptsz,comment
decentraland,,"I understand.

It's a bit like judging World of Warcraft based on an early alpha build. The graphics will improve over time, but it's fundamentally limited in its graphics because 1) it's meant to be runnable for the average person in a browser on commodity hardware and 2) there is not a centralized corporation like Blizzard creating uniformly high quality content. The players are the creators, which is what's so cool, but also what can create the perception that the game is generally low quality.

I don't think people are coming to Decentraland for the graphics or for a traditional gaming experience. They're here for the social element, the ability to display NFTs, and to just generally explore a new kind of virtual world.

decentraland,,"I have both. The land because I think it’ll go up a lot in value. It already has. Plus being a land owner allows you to make passive income off it depending on how you use it.

decentraland,,"if you were to value them purely based on the utility they are assigned within the DCL governance model - i.e. the DAO Voting Power they entitle the holder to, then assuming an average parcel value of $10000 and a MANA price of $2.5:

$10K if held in MANA = 4000 MANA = 4000 units of DCL Voting Power

$10k if held in LAND = 1 parcel = 2000 units of DCL voting power.

This implies that if you want to invest purely in DCL DAO governance rights (which is more or less the defi proxy for having an ownership stake in the whole ecosystem), then holding MANA direct is a better way to achieve this. In fact buying MANA would always be a better way to achieve this whilst land costs anything over 2000 MANA.

I say this as someone who holds LAND and not MANA. The additional value i get from LAND is the ability to use it in interesting (and in future potentially revenue generating) ways.

I also think the voting power associated with land should be increased several times over - but i'm probably biased.",hv9ptkc,2022-02-02 12:51:46,supertyler,[],/r/decentraland/comments/si6v7t/is_it_better_to_own_land_in_decentraland_or/hv9ptkc/,1,0,,1,0,si6v7t,comment

It was super cool to be in the 'virtual crowd,' as a fan of live music.

Also as an artist, I'm excited for this space to grow, so we can thrown our own live events on our land regularly.

decentraland,MANA social hype is soaring due to the Facebook rebranding,"A few friends and I got together to create a crypto analytics platform that scrapes data from various social platforms to alert on over 5000+ coins including MANA.

Today's top socially trending coin is MANA. We think it has most to do facebook/metaverse hype thats created these relentess spikes in social activity.

It would be great to understand if this latest news is the biggest factor causing this surge in community activity or if there's anything else contributing to MANA's social wave?

We post these alerts daily on our reddit if you want to keep up with the community engagement for MANA and the other 5000+ coins

Alert shown below:

It's still very much in the early phase, but you can just feel the limitless potential. 

So far, I've played roulette and blackjack in the casino and am up a few hundred in Free Money. There's a ""casino night"" tonight at 5:00pm EST so I transferred some MANA from my Coinbase account to my decentraland wallet through Metamask, in hopes that I can win some actual crypto. Right now, I'm mining in the WonderMine Crafting game and chatting with other players.  


I can't wait to see what other features come out, because this place is already booming in popularity.

decentraland,,"It doesn't matter. There are thousands of little-used MMORPGs out there, with even smaller userbases. Do they have the worldwide brand awareness of Decentraland? Of course not. DCL is in mainstream newspapers and news media. The main obstacle to entry in Decentraland is the price - it's very expensive to get in. This will change (eventually), but for now the draw is digital property - being able to trade in digital property. Gameplay is kind of irrelevant at this point. DCL offers opportunities for investors and developers to build. The early are the early, and they'll be rewarded.

Just a machine to run a spreadsheet for double-entry bookkeeping. And these things we're using now, on the internet, on our phones, in our TVs, etc. are all based on that surge. Ring a bell with DCL?

IBM makes most of their money of patens these days. They sold everything worth while to pump their stock and kept some storage and mainframes which they will most likely sell off too and go full cloud chasing the next thing. I love IBM equipment. It ""USED"" to be great. It all comes down to the CEO and direction they want to take. It used to be expensive, but the service was fantastic and the techs/support were good. They chased the money and are the same as anything else now. Yes they are a giant so they will not disappear, but if you look at their stock price it's never been the same after it came down.  First isn't ALWAYS best.  Getting into IBM early would have been good though.    Mind you.

decentraland,,"I can't think of a better place than Decentraland for any of the following:

\- University lectures given to students over the internet (better than Zoom), with the ability to integrate AI (machine learning corrective technology) assistants

\- Art galleries 

\- Exhibitions of particular types of product, e.g. bathrooms (taking over BBBY in the USA) using rented space

\- Foreign language lessons where teachers and students each have an avatar, mic and headset instead of camera (awkward), mic and headset, and so are less inhibited. Costs down because class can be given to multiple people

\- Yoga or pilates classes where people can feel less body-conscious and beginners can *give it a go*

\- Dancehalls and concert rooms. DJs or instrumentalists or concerts or singers

\- Algorithmic art in full audio-visual representation

\- Actual clothes boutiques (replacing the dying high street), where people can wander around and try clothes on their avatar after seeing a photo, and then decide for themselves if they want it in real life

\- Product launches of high end items: luxury watches, cars, etc.

There are other projects of this sort but none of them are really ready to do this *right now*. Lots of projects that are over-promising and which will underdeliver.

The third layer of DCL will be the platform that developers will develop. Current textures and forms can be upgraded automatically, with shading and pixellation, over time. 

Conceptually, nothing comes close to translating the idea of building blocks, to young people. You give someone Assassins Creed or an Unreal Engine-based game, and they're blown away. You give someone Minecraft, and they're inspired to create a medieval castle and a nice town.

In short, I see a LOT of potential in DCL (which owes me nothing, incidentally, as I withdrew my initial investment long ago and am sitting on what was left).",hn54c5m,2021-12-04 01:33:29,Squirida,[],/r/decentraland/comments/r71hcr/decentraland_is_the_future_bitcoin_of_the/hn54c5m/,2,0,,2,0,r71hcr,comment

decentraland,,This is one of my first cryptos I bought around 0.22 and sold half at 0.33 because of the gain on my initial investment within a month.   Felt bad because it went to ath and could have had larger gains.   Bought some more in the high 0.70s 0.80s a few months back due to belief in the project and the fact we are still in the early phase of crypto adoption.   The only thing that I can’t het my head around is the future potential as the coin in used to buy land and build and can be cost prohibitive for a lot of people to join in thereby potentially capping the future value in the low $$ range for the coin itself.  What may I be missing in my thinking about the future value potential of this coin?

decentraland,," That they are letting players mine DG and be the house is pretty amazing. Just from personnel experience I lost maybe $1500 in MANA playing casino games, but I earned almost 6 DG, which is now valued at $444 each, which I can stake and earn over 20%APY. So while they are giving out DG it is a no brainer. You get the governance token are allowed to stake, and can see the treasury value keep growing, and it will only get better with growth.

decentraland,,"Since a lot of you did NOT read this blog post I will summarize. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization. While some DAOs offer governance tokens, DCL is not. They will look at at the amount of LAND you own and MANA you have wrapped and give you voting rights and the ability to propose changes based upon that. Meaning, THERE IS NO NEW COIN. Stop saying that. Seriously, do some research. I mean, at least read the blog. This will positively effect the price of MANA and LAND but more importantly actively allocate grants to spur development of new ideas in DCL which is what we need desperately. We are in the first inning of metaverses. Naw. Not even. We still in the parking lot tailgating before the game. I am pleased to have all of us together in this sub. In truth, I know we will grow exponentially from here. I must STAUNCHLY recommend a lot of you who have “invested” in MANA go to the DCL website and READ ALL OF IT. Everyone please, take the time to learn about DAPPS and what they do before you toss money in a coin. Investing is ducking brutal and even with massive amounts of research still super risky.",gzebl59,2021-05-25 14:52:37,Accomplished-Cream-1,[],/r/decentraland/comments/nk392k/introducing_the_new_decentraland_dao/gzebl59/,5,0,,5,0,nk392k,comment

decentraland,,"Should be a positive thing. All it means is Mana will be able to be moved to the polygon L2 for use in game, etc. 

More usage of Mana as the virtual currency, more value it should accrue. 

Here’s an example. 

It doesn't cost anything to mint an ""awarded"" wearable to use in game. But right now, because that is done on L1, you have to pay about $40-80 in gas fees.

Once the system runs on L2, you pay pennies in fees for the same thing. 

**Two things to note**

1.	There is still a gas fee to “send” Mana to L2. But once you are there, you are good. 
2.	I expect to see an adoption of more Oracle based pricing. Meaning we will see an adjustment in “Mana” cost based on equivalent USD cost. So things like buying a name could become cheaper. 

For #2, there just hasn’t been a huge incentive to do this yet because of the high L1 gas fees.",gt7nrd9,2021-04-03 03:43:10,cryptostriker,[],/r/decentraland/comments/mixzvg/to_moon/gt7nrd9/,12,0,,12,1,mixzvg,comment

decentraland,,"Omg! Thank you for commenting. I greatly appreciate that! -seriously. This is how we grow our projects; by conversing, coming up with ideas and implementing. People are pretty flipping friendly, I do agree. I just really think it would be a good investment to create a welcoming committee. 
We could potentially accelerate the growth of this project in doing so. 
Within my experience of customer service in general, the more you take the initiative to involve others, ask them their input/ opinions and educate them, the more invested they become. And what better way to do that than to have educated, strategically designated people who are live in DL actively answering questions in chat and interacting. 
It’s like how people use bots to hype shit up except You can trust these people because they are real members of the community. 
Can I curse on here? Anyways...
It’s the quickest way to grow a small project in my opinion. DL just doesn’t feel like a community and it’s supposed to be.
People are like, yeah Decentraland!
But I need some major HELL YEAH DECENTRALANDs!
Lol. 
Also, discussions like this are extremely important. Someway somehow, the community of DL needs to become more actively involved in the community itself with discussing ideas and opinions and implementing them once again, outside of event hosting. That is super fun but it’s not making a difference where it counts, I believe. You can’t build a structure without a stable foundation 
That is how the most successful companies became well.... successful. Lol.

I’m so sorry. I know I talk a lot and over explain sometimes but I get really excited when I talk with other people. I don’t really feel like I’m apart of anything accept reddit and crypto in general. Lol. 
So once again, I really appreciate you taking the time to respond and open my mind and perspective.",gy44mad,2021-05-14 16:09:59,Lie-KUH-peen,[],/r/decentraland/comments/nbten0/hello_guys_im_proud_to_be_part_of_decentraland_i/gy44mad/,3,0,,3,0,nbten0,comment

\----------------------------

Here's another one that I'm really excited to release to the community:  The Tower!

The Tower features three inner floors as well as a wide open rooftop stage, connected by an elegant spiral staircase in the center of the building.  The roof is the perfect spot for gatherings, events, livestreams, or concerts, and the interior floors have ample room for NFT displays or whatever tickles your fancy.

The build occupies right around half of the resources allocated to a 2x2 estate, leaving plenty of room for customization by the owner.

Additionally, fully baked lighting maps ensure that your parcel will be noticed by explorers and remembered by visitors.  This build stands out from the crowd, get it before it's gone!

decentraland,,"As someone said, I would think you would first bar entry to your plot via age verification terminal of some sort. Once I you could setup NFT viewing galleries, links to sites, cam streams, videos, artists. 

I think sexy NFT wearables would fit under such things. Also if you're a content creator, you could update the NFTs you are displaying and selling as you create more content... 

Hmm 🤔 you could also make some interactive game where an npc strips and dances. Could also make it a porn theater showing clips, movies of porn.

decentraland,,"The building tool lets you do simplistic things, like dressing a scene or moving objects around. You'd have to get your hands dirty into the SDK to produce something like that. Right now, we're a little lacking on the developer-side, as those who are in the space are already attached to larger projects.

Of course it is possible to set up a fall-guys form of game, allow users to sign-up to participate by paying some Mana to act as a price pool, and feed it out to the finalists. But that would require a fair bit of time to produce and, as with all things that include money, there would be people looking to cheat. This means you would not only have to create a scene that has a modular game-swapping system (and the games), but also write and host an authoritative server to ensure cheating isn't easy.

Also, with the way the SquidGames token robbed its audience, you might have trouble getting people to trust the initial setup.",hkd4tra,2021-11-12 18:47:25,TheCryptoTrader69,[],/r/decentraland/comments/qs41xd/we_need_to_make_a_squid_game_event_for/hkd4tra/,5,0,,5,0,qs41xd,comment

decentraland,,"A lot is personal choice.  The argument from the real world that location matters is why you see such a large spread in prices, but since you can teleport to anywhere instantly with a link it seems like it should matter less.  

That said, I chose a parcel next to a road (a corner lot actually) because I don’t want to have a neighbors completely building up all around me making it hard to see a full-front view of my property, and making it impossible to walk to my property.  This might not matter to some but I think it is an important consideration.

decentraland,,"We found common ground—fuck Damien and his stuffed shark! I’ve been looking at putting a few Mickey Mouse nickels into DCL hence this banter with Prof Smallz. Last nugget re Christies speech class debate: DCL and NFT is about the p2p owner and trade experience. Consequently, Christies is the “third party” musty blazer of old auction houses. 2020 also saw steep declines of in person paddle hold bids. A different type of art investor was needed beyond The call in bid. Hold the phone!! The wink. The touch your left ear lobe “I want that piece of shit!” Sold!! Nod nod. And then the auction casa gaming: When a lot sells to “invisible” ...after lukewarm interest. Wait, WTF? “Ok next lot”... Art truly is loads of BS. Online or offline. Christies can now cater to the NFT dude. As the old timers die holding a paddle. Sorta like smokers. You
Need fresh blood. But again. It’s a third party hype. Of course they are gonna accept crypto. 
Just as DCL fans see opportunity for virtual land. Well—in that space do we need shoulder padded blazers to sell art or give creed to digi punk jack? Prob not. People rub their isolated socially distanced eyes. DCL may have a brighter future than Christie and Co. I just cant get into DCL yoga or wearables.

decentraland,,"Haha made me laugh.  Yeah I don’t know where DCl is going and it’s not worth more than nickels at this point I agree, but to the extent that this is just a NFT test being shilled by Beeple, I would be shocked if fashion houses didn’t at least follow suit and test it as well.  Buy a pair of Balenciaga’s and they come with an NFT as an extension of their existing use of blockchain for supply chain authentication, and of course it’s also part publicity stunt.  

Whether DCL will see a boom from this I don’t know, but LAND is a pretty cool NFT that has other potentials beyond the collectible and aesthetic value that will be assigned to wearables and artwork.

The historic art auction house  Sotheby’s announced Thursday that it will have real-time bids in ETH for  its upcoming auction of Banksy paintings.

The auction, dubbed “The Now,” will  occur on November 18 and consist of Banksy’s Trolley Hunters and Love in  the Air artworks. As of publication, the paintings are estimated to  cost between $5 to 7 million and $4 to 6 million, respectively, in USD.

There's a lot of events and concerts going on weekly and there are a lot of games and art galleries to check out but not everything is visible on the map. You just have to explore or get a friend who knows their way around the game. Plus in the future they plan on making it VR compatible so there's that extra immersive layer to add to it. I think it'll hold up amazingly against sandbox and other metaverses but you have a right to your opinion and I respect it.,hp91rv8,2021-12-20 03:15:20,SoulLime4332,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rk73q0/more_i_read_about_metaverses_more_i_believe_in/hp91rv8/,7,0,,7,1,rk73q0,comment
decentraland,,"I’ve been enjoying it (about 3 months in). I don’t own land, but You can usually find me playing mini games with some friends, grinding out P2E’s, crafting wearables, at events for drops, visiting shops, and being a degen at the casinos. 

I saw gameplay with sandbox and comparing both, I think they’ll each have their place. Both have big names behind them, investments, etc. i believe sandbox is going to have multiple issues upon launch, and this can take a lot of time to polish, just like DCL is still trying to do, but they have worked out a lot of kinks. 
DCL has wearables, not land, but wearables going for 10’s of thousands of dollars. Even for sandbox, I even seen a DJ table going for 2k SAND which hasn’t released yet. The metaverse in general is still EARLY. But I like the indicators I see. Hell I can’t even find a poker table at the casinos on Saturday nights sometimes in DCL. 

When sandbox releases, I’ll for sure probably get my feet wet with it. But I do believe both will have a large piece of the Market Share either way. 

I do also believe that a lot of this for either side depends a lot on the communities in them as well",hp9qk6f,2021-12-20 07:21:23,Aggravating_Fix1198,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rk73q0/more_i_read_about_metaverses_more_i_believe_in/hp9qk6f/,3,0,,3,0,rk73q0,comment

decentraland,Decentraland should step up their game if they want to lead into the metaverse,"Just seen the movie ""Free Guy"" and I couldn't stop thinking about haw similar is to Decentraland like ""Ready Player One""... I will not get into details because we have discussed this so many times but i really think that the DAO and Creators of Decentraland should get involved more in this kind of development and not just organize some random parties with 20 people, or just waiting someone to build something there...They have in their hands the opportunity to create something that no one has done and would be absolutely amazing to be able finally utilize the full potential of the metaverse and blockchain technology. Cmon guys you can do better than that just change a little bit your direction there is nothing wrong with that, also when will be ready the phone version of the game?!

Regarding to MANA price it will continue to go up but very slowly/more improvements and partnerships are needed to Decentraland in order to reach new ATH, Hodling and DCA is the best strategy.",pw3hvd,2021-09-26 22:08:14,Crypto-Jim33,[],/r/decentraland/comments/pw3hvd/decentraland_should_step_up_their_game_if_they/,66,0,40,66,0,pw3hvd,post
decentraland,,"DCL devs aren’t here to pump our bags, relax and enjoy the ride. Building a completely decentralised metaverse is about as complex as it sounds. 

The problem right now imo is in the LAND owners & districts - there’s too many speculators hodling empty LAND looking around and waiting for everyone else to bring value. There’s projects like MetaZone who are trying to solve that by creating game franchises that have easy way for LAND owners to deploy their game content on their LAND & split the revenue. Check it out: https://rovi.ai/ & https://metazone.io/

Their belief is that play 2 earn model is what’s gonna bring masses to DCL first and then build a world around that. Makes a lot of sense",heelz1y,2021-09-26 22:51:40,spinz808,[],/r/decentraland/comments/pw3hvd/decentraland_should_step_up_their_game_if_they/heelz1y/,10,0,,10,0,pw3hvd,comment

decentraland,,"Decentraland is designed as a digital city more than a metaverse: it is centralized on a finite number of plots all contained within a single space. There are a few issues that i see standing in the way of Decentraland reaching its full potential. 

The first is the lack of active community developers. I've found some pretty interesting project such as Ethermon. However most of the available content is either art, gambling disguised as gathering sims, or straight up gambling (which will hurt the game in Europe due to their regs). What we need are free social games that treat Decentraland as a platform and provide a gateway for new users to see the potential of this project.

The second is how land is managed at a basic level. Its treated as a hosting space for content, but it is finite, meaning there is always opportunity cost associated with what you choose to place on your land. 

e.g. if you had to chose between hosting a free game or a game that will generate a visible, profit most users would pick the one that provides income and disregard the intangible gains of a free game. This will lead to most landowners viewing their plots as hard investment, only placing paid-for content on their plots. This means any new users will have to pay for their first taste of any content, which will lead to a much smaller number of adopters.

Another issue with finite land supply is the impact of speculation holders. These people understand there is an inherent value in the land, but have no intention of developing it, and seek only to make a profit on selling it off to someone who will.

You can see how these two issues feed each other: no one wants to host free games because land is worth as much as the most profitable thing you can host on it, so you don't need to develop land to add/give it value. You can just hold land and sell it after its value has become realized.

What would fix this is providing personal land parcels at a standard cost, but limit their size and functionality, while maintaining the city parcels. This would allow easy access for developers to showcase projects and games on affordable land, but force large projects to be hosted on city parcels. This could bring in a bundle of challenges of its own, but it would ultimately be a step in the right direction.

The most we can do at this point is continue to build up our community to be the best it can be and hope these issues are addressed before another metaverse that is better designed appears.",heezpnv,2021-09-27 00:42:42,TheCryptoTrader69,[],/r/decentraland/comments/pw3hvd/decentraland_should_step_up_their_game_if_they/heezpnv/,6,0,,6,0,pw3hvd,comment
decentraland,,"IMO the DCL vision is the best of all metaverse projects. The platform is fundamentally open in ways that other platforms are not. This creates enormous longer term benefits in terms of the flexibility that will be available to both users and creators, and the ways in which people can experience the world, but it also creates a more complex technical roadmap.  

It's easy to say the platform should be developing advanced gameplay features, but you have to recognise that the role of the DCL foundation is to create the tools, and it will mostly be the role of the private sector developer communities to create the in world experiences, games and apps that those tools enable.

The reality is that the base infrastructure does not yet support the features complex gameplay would require, we are literally still at the ""make it work for basic stuff"" stage, so in addition to things like wearables and improving the scene builder, the foundation are working on fundamental things like:

 \- Reducing run-time lag/crashes whilst simultaneously enabling more complex scene graphics and interactivity. I believe this will be addressed at least in part with the introduction of a client side application which would cache scene filedata to reduce runtime bandwidth and central processing.

\- Enabling dynamic ""realm"" shifting so that you always see the people close by and don't experience the world alone because others are connected via a different server.

\- Shifting most transactional events to L2 to reduce associated fees and confirmation lag.

\- Enabling full VR based access.

You can expect the resulting available gameplay to evolve as these core platform features are built up over time, but these are all relatively complex tasks and I'm sure this is just a few from the ""to do"" list. They'll need some time, the best thing you could do is to recognise the vision/roadmap and try to find ways to support either the foundation or the community of early developers building on the platform (check out Rovi - mentioned by others here). If nothing else, more users will attract more outside investment into the development of in-world spaces. I have noticed quite an uptick in in-world events recently  (the recent Wall St Bets takeover was both entertaining and engaging, by far the best example of a build I have seen) - so just hang out and think about the stories you'll be able to tell when it really is like Ready Player 1 and you are an OG who remembers when much of the world was still just open space and characters couldn't even kill each other yet.",hehg9x7,2021-09-27 15:53:59,supertyler,[],/r/decentraland/comments/pw3hvd/decentraland_should_step_up_their_game_if_they/hehg9x7/,3,0,,3,0,pw3hvd,comment

decentraland,,"Ahoy there hope things are well with ye, so I'm looking at renting as a less preferred option but the primary intent is LAND development! If you have any LAND you would like to add custom modeled scenes to, I am your guy! I've got around 20 years 3d modeling/texturing/animation experience under my belt from humble beginnings as a Total Annihilation modder, and recruited my younger brother, a promising compsci student, to speed along SDK/backend production. I'm prodding a number of artist friends to make concepts for me, but now the only missing link is LAND. I have a bit of a crypto treasure chest available but the LAND prices have jumped quite quickly - so now I figure the best way to the big time is to partner with some LAND holders to do value-added developments for a profit share. Is that something you'd be interested in?

I am invested very hard into crypto, but not MANA, and for good reasons. 

Why not invest in L1 solutions that have similar upside but less risk?

decentraland,,">ople on here are gambling and don’t realize

Tf you mean how is it calculated? Lol my initial SHIB investment of 2k hit ATH of $30k and is currently floating between $12-$15k. I remember when people called me stupid and said I was gambling on that too. But I actually did weeks of research and came to the correct conclusion

What makes me think the future of the metaverse is tied to Decentraland? Lol really? Its one of the first projects, by far the most unique, one of the most mainstream, marketable, celebrities are already getting on board, and the buying/selling land is great. How you can build custom lands, how the economy works, and how the governance works is just great, attractive and very interesting

You are strawmanning my arguments-- I do not invest in projects ""because I have a good feeling about them."" Never used that line of logic, and never would. I invest in projects I can rationally see a future in based on how things have been, how they're going, WHERE they are going, how the world is changing, what the developers are up to, etc.

decentraland,,"Gamblers can make money, it doesn’t mean they are not gambling. 

Being first does not matter if no one plays it. Do you play it? Have you tried playing it? You still have not answered.

Buying and selling land and governance is not hard and other projects do the same things. The hard problems for metaverse are creating the infrastructure (software and hardware) to run a massive world that millions of people can use concurrently. We are far still from solving this problem. We don’t even have “centralized” solutions to these yet, so it’s such a stretch to think we will have decentralized solutions. And that’s one of the problems with decentraland, its decentralized in name only. The simulation layer is very centralized, because it has to be. And their simulation layer sucks and is now where near where it needs to be to support actual generic stuff that you would want for a metaverse.

It is much more likely that a company like FB, Roblox, or Epic games will develop a v1 of the metaverse, and will either open it up or a decentralized version will come after. 

There are crypto projects working on getting a truly decentralized generic compute infra up and running, but its still early and the scope of problem they are trying to solve is much smaller than “metaverse”, and its still a hard problem that will take time. 

If decentraland actually had a player base, I could see some argument for how once those breakthroughs happen they get absorbed into decentraland, but there is no player base. 


Look, I’m not saying you can’t make money in MANA. You definitely can and I hope you make tons of money. I’m sure the price will continue to pump and do well due to the metaverse hype caused by FB and speculators speculating. But that doesn’t mean its not gambling. 

For L1s, ETH is a lot less risky and will likely outperform MANA in the next 10 years. Way less downside and similar upside.",hqi008j,2021-12-30 03:18:07,Throwaway3691776,[],/r/decentraland/comments/rqot7u/just_invested_10000/hqi008j/,0,0,,0,0,rqot7u,comment

No I don't play it-- I don't use Tinder, Im still invested in Match. I dont use Microsoft, Im still invested in it. What's your point? I dont have time to sit around and play games at the moment. This has nothing to do with my investment decision LOL

And dude for the love of god stop with the gambling comparison, you are being flat out delusional and already created a comment why. Just because there is a great deal of risk involved with something does not mean it is gambling. Is it moderate/high risk? Possibly. But not gambling. Seriously stop embarrassing yourself you sound like a Boomer. Go invest in a mutual fund.

Decentraland being first gives it a great chance of it gaining traction before other platforms, their crypto is also a Top 30 coin--Celebrities are hopping in as I have already mentioned. Its known and established in the sphere, why are you neglecting this?

Look, most of your comment is just pessimism and negativity saying the user base isnt there yet, the tech isnt there yet, etc etc. Guess what? Its called being early, dude. Should I wait for Decentraland to be perfect and with one million daily users? It seems like this is the strategy you'd take? But at that point the price is going to be sky-high and I will have missed the boat. Look, there was a point in time when the internet itself and automobiles had 18,000 daily users, it was called a fad and laughed at. People said the tech sucked and it wasnt 'there yet.'

Being first doesn’t matter. And it matters even less when you have no users. Plenty of examples of companies being first that are dead now. It’s not about being first, its about being the first with a large user base, and even that is not a guarantee.

Celebrities don’t matter. There were plenty of celebs shilling coins that ended up being rug pulls.

I’m not being pessimistic, my points are valid criticism of the project as an investment. You have no rebuttal. Why do you think that in spite of all the negatives it will still succeed? 

Have you researched the team? The leadership? How much funding they have? What incentives do they have to build this out? If you agree it’s not there yet, then what makes you think they get there? What makes you think they get there first?

Look I don’t care what you do. I just called it out as gambling. That’s my opinion, you are free to disagree. If it bothers you than maybe consider why that is.

decentraland,The Future of Decentraland,"My name is ""Hearts"".  Been in DCL for a few months now, developed some land, regularly play Wondermine, made new friends, and generally having a great time.

Here are some of the events that I see happening in Decentraland this decade.  I'd like to revisit this post in 5 years and in 10 years to see how many came true.  Universe, make these a reality please.

\- New and exclusive blockbuster movie screenings at AMC Brand Theaters in DCL.

\- Cannes/Sundance/Toronto/Berlin movie festivals w/ VIP access, celebrity sightings and papparazis will be a thing.

\- Comic-Cons - Will Ferrell, Kevin Smith, Bryan Cranston, Ryan Reynolds in the avatar flesh.. NFT giveaways, fashion shows, events, meet and greets.  Marvel and DC will be a mainstay.

\- GameStop, Louis Vuitton, McDonalds, Apple, Tesla... you name 'em, they'll be here and will be hiring.

\- Live NFL, NBA, Premier League, and other sporting events watchable from 360 VR courtside/50 yard line VIP ""seats"" and/or from the stadiums watching AI generated live-data 3d representations of the players in DCL stadiums.  With live VR sports, Coach and Manager games will be more fun as you can be on the sidelines making your moves.... sports betting of all kinds.

\- DCL already has infinity engine capabilities (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland/comments/mc1fj2/infinity_engine_on_decentraland_huge_game_changer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)).  The potential for in-game expansion is truly infinite.

\- An explosion of new creative flavors and ideas as billions of humans and trillions of Ai join the Internet for the first time (highspeed global satellite internet), version 3.0 and the Metaverse being their first foray.  It will be the ultimate bazaar, global and cosmic trade on an individual level with goods and services changing hands at a rate never seen before thanks to instant and free transactions and free 1-2 day global shipping w/ an uber efficient cyber-physical distribution network.

\- Fully customizable one-off car design irl.  Tell your car designer Ai what you'd like, the design is instantly made, you ask for tweaks as you see fit, the design gets sent to one of the local 3D auto print shops, once the car is born it drives itself to your house.  When you're not using the car, it works as a taxi to make you money.  #KnightRider is real.

\- Same goes for NFT wearables, cars, buildings, virtually anything (haha).  Tell AI what you'd like to design, they do the rest.. for a reasonable fee of course.

\- Disneyland will develop a theme park.  Naturally, the most famous rides and themes will be included, Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald avatars will be available for pictures, Disney NFTs, events, giveaways..  While we're at it, why not Universal Studios, Wizarding World, Six Flags... all of em.

\- The United Nations will create a DAO and hold regular meetings at the DCL Inter-Galactic Trade Center.

\- Intellectually cloned AIs of ourselves will be available.  They will be indistinguishable to our own minds and will react to stimuli according of our coding, and be customizable.  We can sit back and let ourselves work in the Metaverse while we pursue creative endeavors, relax, game, travel, etc. in the 3d world.

\- Now that we can Imagine all the people AI can clone, maybe the Beatles will perform live concerts at the Yellow Submarine venue. Read poems, share artwork, hold meditation sessions.. you might even get to talk to them face to face and hear their voice, if they feel up to it.  I wonder what Elvis is up to?  Nikola Tesla are you there?

decentraland,,"$100 USD is my end of year target. The key is localization and we need Chinese and Koreans on board.  Not sure how many of you checked out Against Gravity's RecRoom, with a HTC Vive or Oculus Rift and notice the amount of Chinese or Asian players. South Korea is probably no 1 in e.sports.  


Once we get the word out there, the growth of DCL and by implication MANA, user growth could be like putting TikTok in front of an 13 year old with a Monster Energy drink on one hand, and a double RedBull and Vodka on the other.    


That is the catalyst needed. The Chinese know how to build shit man. Everything is made in China. Hell, even the largest Crypto exchange is Chinese, the miners are all Chinese. 

The only thing we ought to thread carefully is the risk of the CPC (Chinese Gov) clamping down, and wants censorship. We will cross that bridge when we get there and that would be a luxury problem to have.   


Tiktok is 180 bln valuation with talks of 500bln USD target by IPO. DCL with 2.6 billion tokens out can easily justify a 100 dollar price. The key is we need to get people in game.  


And one thing I know is the Chinese love to gamble, every casino you go to around the world, you will definitely see some Chinese.

I think we should prioritze localiszation or bring that forward and let them come in build shit. I don't care if they build Great Wall. We'll get the Trump/MAGA crowd into and let the claim it is theirs. LOL

decentraland,,"I think it's mostly that it's running in the browser. I believe the team is working on a Unity implementation now. I'm sure they'll have it running on low end VR hardware in a year or 2.

One other consideration, the content of decentraland is provided by the users and owners of decentraland. There's no central ""game developer"". There's a team building tools for the world, but it's individual efforts that create the actual places of interest in the world.

They could create a world that would allow AAA graphics, but I think very few people would create detailed 3d objects with detailed texture maps. Also, it'd be a lot more expensive to store all that data on the ETH blockchain.",glr3vm9,2021-02-02 17:03:35,edwilli222,[],/r/decentraland/comments/laxe97/well_i_did_it/glr3vm9/,10,0,,10,0,laxe97,comment
decentraland,,"The performance problems we have, affecting many different hardware setups, is mostly due to:

\* Running in the browser:

\- The browser limits the memory and processing capabilities of the build

\- Even though the explorer executable is a Webassembly build (fastest GPU and native access from the browser), Unity Webassmebly building doesn't have multi-threadding support, and probably the code conversions needed to get from .net/Mono to Webassembly results in a not-so-efficient code compared to building to other platforms.

\* Streaming content:

\- Decentraland can't have everything baked and faked (lightmaps, etc.) like in a regular game, in dcl case every scene (composed by LANDs) must be streamed into the explorer and instantiated in runtime (some files are actually cached locally to avoid re-downloading stuff of your frequently accessed scenes, etc.), that means downloading the scene code (and start running it sandboxed in a browser webworker), and all the other scene resources (GLTF models, textures, audio). For the GLTF models the resource has to be parsed on demand (kinda like a JSON with vertices, materials and animation info) and that takes a lot of processing power (an  optimization to convert the GLTF/Texture assets into Unity Asset Bundles when deploying the lands has already been implemented, but it still has problems that are being tackled)

\- The explorer has to apply optimizations in runtime, for example in a regular game one could minimize the used materials/textures amount in an offline creation pipeline, but in our case the explorer has to recognize which textures are being reused cross-scenes and manage that, etc. This also applies for meshes batching optimizations (we are doing nothing of the sorts in runtime yet)

\* Several scenes processing:

\- Since every deployed scene can have very different code and logic complexity (using Decentraland SDK), performance varies a lot across the 90k LANDs in the world depending on ""where you stand"", in some cases you can have a couple of scenes around you that do medium processing stuff in their code (there are already throttling optimizations regarding the distance to every loaded scene, etc.) and in other situations you can have many scenes around you doing heavy stuff, and it will affect performance. (There is a URL param right now called LOS for Line Of sight in which you can change the radius of scenes loaded around you, for example LOS=0 would keep you limited to the scene you enter the world, and LOS=1 would load a radius of 1 scenes around you at all times, the default is 10 I think, we'll probably see this in the settings panel in the near future)

When the Explorer gets to other platforms, we will probably see nice performance improvements, comparable to the performance we get when running the explorer from Unity.",glvqejx,2021-02-03 17:05:45,Pravusjif,[],/r/decentraland/comments/laxe97/well_i_did_it/glvqejx/,2,0,,2,0,laxe97,comment

decentraland,So I played decentraland,"Game was laggy as hell, had an obvious memory leak watched it chew through 16gb of ram in about 15 seconds every time I open it and then it just crashed with a memory error.

How is a browser game laggy on a gaming rig lmao.

I get why owning virtual real estate in a populated game world could be lucrative but this doesn't seem to be it, the game doesn't even run yet lots selling for over 2mill usd?

&#x200B;

edit: my thoughts after reading a bunch of comments on this thread.

So a lot of people who support DCL believe that DCL is going to make radical improvements.

I personally don't agree with this, DCL is basically a game (some people say it isn't a game), it needs to be coded and developed, in my experience games that are in a really shitty state like DCL take a ton of development time to actually get to where they need to be.

It makes much more sense to me that the game is that is going to take the metaverse by storm is quietly being developed as we speak.

A lot of people seem to be drawing this comparison between DCL and say bitcoin (even subconsciously), in the fact that bit coin has gone up millions of % in the last decade, but bitcoin is so fundamentally different to DCL.

I'm a gamer, games die ***FAST*** these days. I don't see why this is going to be any different to games in the metaverse, people are always going to want that next virtual social experience in the metaverse, a lot of the DCL bulls are banking on this game becoming a masterpiece in 5 years or something? Something is going to blow all the current metaverse games out of the water and it will happen overnight I promise you.

And to add one more layer of practicality to my argument look at facebook, it was the biggest social media platform at one point but even it got dethroned by instagram, and now we have tik tok.

I also think what would make a lot more sense for the metaverse as a whole is to have one cryptocurrency that would be accepted across every game in the metaverse, that would be much easier to trade as a whole and also if one game in the metaverse dies you want rapidly lose the value of all of your currency in that game, no ones going to hold currency of a game that is slowly dying which will cause it to die even faster and will limit the metaverse as a whole.

According to wikipedia DCL has been developed by two Argentinians, what happens when a big game studio decides to make a metaverse? (I would be shocked if some game studios aren't already making metaverses)

the game is lucky to have 1500 concurrent players yet has a billion dollar market cap, it is a bubble of insane proportions, that will be popped by a way better product making it obsolete.

decentraland,,"Best play for next 100x is NeosVR by far, they're about 5 years ahead others when it comes to the actual VR product and tech. It's still small cap, totally hidden gem, with only 50 million max supply.

The experience itself is combination of VRChat + Garry's mod + Roblox, so you can have 10 million creators creating businesses, 3D objects as nft's and god knows what (imagination being the limit) that will bring 10x more users to the platform.

It's like the beginning of Ethereum but in Virtual Reality, it's a platform, metaverse engine. Very exciting stuff! I've yet to see a cryptoinvestor who's not impressed by the project so this will move fast with exposure.

Edit:

The word about it is just now starting to spread fast so do your research and be quick about it. For starters visit their website: [https://neos.com/](https://neos.com/)

Edit2: Oh and you're welcome, we all want a great metaverse that's not provided by Zuck and this could be it.
