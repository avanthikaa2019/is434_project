CryptoArt,"Tommy Hollenstein | World famous artist | Creating the world’s largest real-life art piece and NFT project | 10,000 pieces - everyone buys receives the artwork in the post! | Supported by Ringo Starr"," 

The NFT is a UNIQUE Tommy Hollenstein painting. He is painting an extremely large artwork 20x400 feet. There will be 1k pieces cut into 10k pieces and digitized. Each piece will be sold as an NFT. Checkout the DRIVE above to see! **People will get an NFT + The Physical Artwork in the post!**

**Why is it different?**

Tommy's painting is one of the first fine art NFT out there. No one has a project on the scale of Tommy's. Tommy's painting is one of the largest paintings ever made. 

The quality of art with the sheer scope of it all is unmatched in the world. 

**Some NFT’s will be uniquely rare, and signed by celebrities like Ringo Star - Anyone has the chance to own one!** **AND People will get an NFT + The Physical Artwork in the post!**

**Why should people invest in the token? What are their benefits?**  


Tommy's paintings are purchased by many wealthy people and famous celebrities. Also the story behind Tommy is incredibly motivating. One of the benefits of buying the NFT is the ability to get the physical copy too after holding onto the NFT for a certain amount of time. The logistics are still being worked around but you will get the physical. After buying 5 NFTs you will be put into a raffle for a free sculptor made from all the brushes that were used on the project. These brushes will also have the celebrities brushes included in it.

**Why are you guys better than other NFTs?**

The painting itself is higher quality then any NFT in the market. Tommy's painting is considered fine art, and there will be certain NFTs that are painted by celebrities too like Ringo Star.

Most NFT projects are computer generated or low quality artworks. This piece is real fine art. It is done by a legitimate professional artist. Another thing that makes this unique is the fact that you can get the physical piece alongside the digital. It is not often done where you can get both.    


**Who is the team? Why are they amazing and trustworthy? What makes them capable of delivering?**  
The team is Joseph Silva as the project manager, Samual Moegenburg, Cassidy Barnette, and the Dreamcenter. The Dreamcenter is an amazing non profit that has been around 27 years and have helped over 7 million people. They are providing the studio and the general labor to get this project working.

**Big partners?**

The Dreamcenter is the beneficiary, a massive non profit that has been around for 27 years. They have programs to help with the homeless and drug addicts. They house tons of families and veterans. They have a witness protection program and they even help with displaced children. They feed thousands of people every day in the city of los angeles. Check them out below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V5jFRpqmZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V5jFRpqmZE) 

**What is the token supply?**

Tommy’s unique painting will be cut into 10k pieces, and those pieces will be digitized into NFTs. This means there will be 10k unique NFTs. 

**Why are the tokens worth buying?**  
Tommy is one of the most inspirational people you will ever meet. His story of perseverance with his disability and how he never gave up no matter what his situation brought him in, is truly unique. We truly believe that his story and just who he is on top of being an amazing artist will bring value to the project, you can check it out here:

**How do I buy the tokens? (Easy mode explanation)**

CryptoArt,,"Thank you!

Pipeline is standart for this days — C4D with Redshift and some Houdini magic for cloth sim:)

Thanks to modern software now is easier than ever get some good base meshes even with textures. DAZ is good enough for this kind of work. Also there are very good free cc0 models on Sketchfab and Artstation and now you can rig hi-poly scans in Mixamo or with Volumetric Autorig in C4D.

Trickiest part was to manually put all characters together for nice result. Sounds simple, but in fact it turned out to be very difficult to fit everything into a limited diamond shape and maintain an aesthetic appearance. 8 Hands and legs is no joke:) And hairs! One of the things I liked the most from this artwork and from which I suffered the most. I had to do a good sim and manual job with the hairbrush to give that ""frozen underwater look"" for it",gqmdi9f,2021-03-11 21:45:06,Ivldkv,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/m2gcbb/captivity_part_1_my_first_nft_drop_on_rarible/gqmdi9f/,1,0,,1,0,m2gcbb,comment

CryptoArt,🌕 Safemoon-AVAX 🚀 | Launchpad in Development | Heavy Marketing | $10K Giveaway Live,"










The token launched only a few days ago and went from a 10k Market Cap to over 3 million. Seeing the rapid growth of the token inspired us to further explore our vision. We wanted to combine the two main focuses we had for this project. Facilitating the growth of the C-Chain by:

1) Driving traffic to the AVAX network

2) Providing that traffic with a project that is safe with a team that they can believe in

The success of the launch was a clear indicator to us that, with the backing that we have already received, it was our responsibility to now maximize the utility of this token. The only logical path from here that will maximize the utility of this token, and also directly correlate with our vision for is to create an IDO Launchpad.

In doing so, we will directly be participating in providing a platform and gateway for more legitimate Avalanche C-Chain projects. We have been in this space long enough to know what we are doing, and are incredibly keen on seeing AVAX explode in terms of growth and along with it, provide those joining the network an ability to be a part of the C-Chain’s best projects.

CryptoArt,,"Michah Dowbak aka [Mad Dog Jones](https://blog.cruvoir.com/mad-dog-jones-x-phillips-a-multi-generational-nft) is a multidisciplinary artist from Thunder Bay, Ontario, where he still resides. His works deftly interweave cyberpunk, dystopian imagery exploring themes of beauty, nature and technology. As a lover of the wilderness, which was ever present where he grew up, he brings a fresh thematic to the metropolitan aesthetic, done up in citrus and neon tones of technology somehow rendered as a space naturally human. Dowbak rose to fame in the world of crypto art with the recent success of his Crash + Burn series of NFT artworks, and he is now a headliner in the first major NFT art exhibition at UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing.",gwtkob6,2021-05-03 19:46:06,ccconstantin,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/n45eaj/mad_dog_jones_x_phillips_a_multigenerational_nft/gwtkob6/,1,0,,1,0,n45eaj,comment

CryptoArt,,"This kinda demonstrates a growing distinction between technical artist and conceptual artist.
A great artist is sure someone who's both.
In most cases technical only artists do sell since their work is good, but at a relatively low price, since no real innovation can be found in their work and hence they get no interest from collectors.
Conceptual only artists do sell only in the very lucky case of getting the appropriate attention and prices can go crazy at times
Hybrid artists are sure the most valuable and the ones most likely to get into art history, but not necessarly making sells during their life.
It's a matter of soo many factors!
My suggestion is not to get discouraged but focus on some deep meanings and/or innovation in artworks, quality is something that can improve the overall probablility of sell and a good marketing strategy is key at present. Doing everything needed alone can be overwhelming so building a team could be ideal too.",gutsblb,2021-04-17 10:05:54,Levitosio,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/ms84t1/_/gutsblb/,2,0,,2,0,ms84t1,comment

----World's Largest Adult NFT Marketplace to date. Creators monetizing on their content with no fear of chargebacks or banks saying no, by utilizing $NSFW as a payment. Web 3.0 Revolutionary NFT Marketplace upgrade coming soon!

----Pleasurely.com, their OnlyFans replacement. Built by creators for creators. Interacting with creators will be as easy as the push of a button! Tip with $NSFW. Interact in live streams with $NSFW.

----Adult Gaming platforms being built, giving adult NFTs more utility & value, while playing fun & sexy games, moving forward into the metaverse and beyond!!!!

----Creators are also investors being paid in $NSFW to cash out or HODL to the moooon! It's there choice, not the banks, CC companies, or platforms controlling how they choose to monetize on their content. 


To add to this Adult Ecosystem, the team is adding value to $NSFW and all of its working parts for investors & creators alike in the following ways:
 
----New Staking program being announced to incentivize HODL. With great monetary perks. 
 
---- Nsfwpay.com making buying $NSFW a breeze via flooz trade!

That's the opposite of artistic integrity and originality. You do have without a doubt the technical skills to do great things... Do it! Do YOUR thing, it's gonna lead to success in the end.

You can buy it on pancakeswap, but you will have to add the contract manually:
0x9DAAa05946e486ADd2c81e0d32D936866B8449D9
And set slippage to 8%
It is also available at https://flooz.trade and https://nsfwpay.com (easier to buy but basically both the same as pancakeswap).
Or you can buy and trade without fee on http://lbank.info

CryptoArt,,"u/geometrieva u/Punchkinz Interesting indeed. Does his work, look different from yours? Certainly.

Looking at his and your work ***gives off two completely different energies despite*** the familiarities between the two.

I then took your and his work and color corrected them to be the same color palate in Photoshop and they still looked different, ***but I can still see why your upset***.

&#x200B;

**""The question here is whether you find this sufficiently different from my work to call it yours. ""**

***I felt your ego through my screen*** lmao Like come on, many famous artist literally copy other Artist styles, but their still famous it's still their work. (I'd be happy to list them too btw) And Art historians can easily connect their work to their influencers.

&#x200B;

Your work (**geometrieva**) ***possesses substantially more fine details and nuances***. Albeit, both you guy's work looks generally like Landscaped Gradient Art, which people have been making for decades in illustrator and photoshop lol

However, this is more so ***a case study at the future of Art in the digital realm***. How so?

Well for the simple fact that ***this guy has created a program that can generate work akin to yours simply buy using an AI bot. That's pretty impressive***, no matter how you look at it.

***A bot like that could be made for ANY artist***, digital or traditional...dead or alive.

This is a rabbit hole that could go super deep. I mean, ***who wouldn't be kinda prideful if someone showed you a bot that could create work vaguely familiar to yours without even  half the effort or time?*** (Excluding the time it took to program, source / code)

&#x200B;

He's given you full credit as far as inspiration, but he has not used any of your original work whatsoever.

&#x200B;

I want you two to look up the Artists, **""Parra""(45)  and ""Fucci""(30)** . Parra started making his work first, Fucci got inspired and starting creating his own work. Despite the obvious similarities, you can still tell they’re different. They had their little beef, but ultimately Parra was the bigger man and they came to an agreement down the line (rumors).

&#x200B;

TL:DR:

**It's his work still no matter if he got inspiration from you or not. He's recognized you as his influence but his landscapes are distinguishable enough from yours. I certainly understand your perspective, but let him be.**",gs5gn2i,2021-03-25 09:15:48,Saint-Bolotelli,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'verified-artist'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/mc53e0/dropped_the_first_3_out_of_999_landscapes/gs5gn2i/,2,0,,2,0,mc53e0,comment

CryptoArt,"ASTROMINERS, Everything you NEED to know!","AstroMiners are a breed of tough, hardy humans and cyborgs, who set out on interplanetary journeys to enrich the people on Earth by providing the dying world with new sources of energy. AstroMiners are frontier heroes equipped with a wide variety of talents, skills, and technology who seek out resources on unexplored, alien worlds to save the future of civilization. The collection consists of 8,888 stunning characters based on the blockchain technology.

One of the main goals of the project is to create an interactive and engaging NFT gaming experience that is transparent to, and is governed by the community that built it. Every month, the top 10 performing Guilds will be eligible to vote for a representative to join the High Council for a full month, where they can debate and influence technical changes to the project in accordance with the needs of the community (Discord).

AstroMiners is built on LinearX Meta, providing a fully interoperable platform that frees projects from utilizing multiple game engines and is blockchain agnostic by using proprietary technology. All assets generated will have multiple utilities throughout the Astroverse. For every AstroMiners NFT sold, the crew will be donating one Water Bund via Justdiggit charity.

The overall gameplay looks very intriguing. The multilayered MMORPG Metaverse platform revolves around AstroMiner NFTs. Players can utilize them in various gameplay loops, all with built-in play-to-earn mechanics. The platform also features a resource gathering mini-game, which will be  complemented over time. The resource gathering mini-game takes place on different Land-Plot NFTs, each owned by players. Players can upgrade their Land Plots until it becomes a fully developed Mining facility to gain new features that improve gameplay efficiency and unlock more valuable resources to gather.

Gathered resources can be utilized for purchasing and upgrading equipment or simply turning a profit (on real-time Auction House). You can also buy Official Merch on AstroMiners Meta-Shop. The Astroverse can be a challenging place to tackle alone, which is why there are Guilds that allow players to join with other like-minded individuals to take on more demanding challenges.

**Staking**  
The gaming experience will provide players with both solo and group missions and even bounties to complete for $ASTRO Token. Players can stake their AstroMiner NFTs on the DApp platform on their website to receive $ASTRO Tokens. Holding an AstroMiner entitles the player to collect taxes from Non-AstroMiners which will go into a pool to be distributed among all the AstroMiners. AstroMiners have the option to create jobs on their Land Plots which gives them the right to adjust the tax of the players who do not possess an AstroMiner NFT. They will have to pay for the work they do at your facility. In addition, you can collect royalties from all Land Plots sold on the Marketplace.

The team is very active on their socials. They have over 37k+ members on Discord and 21k+ on Twitter where the crew is highly vocal on topics regarding the changes about the project. New exclusive characters are also revealed on the channel so do not miss out on the updates. Participate in their Discord to find more about Astrominers and the mint day.

**Astrominers Raffle**  
Currently, there is an ongoing raffle only for the lucky persons reading this post. You can participate in the exclusive raffle for a chance to win a spot for the limited Genesis mint, which will be held on March 13th.   
Check out the Raffle: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb1jmxWYnxLRoLuBDLmO\_E6mqNhTc4rL08gAQuKdyRX6-CkQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb1jmxWYnxLRoLuBDLmO_E6mqNhTc4rL08gAQuKdyRX6-CkQ/viewform)

CryptoArt,New NFT collection from LOTTRADE," 

Trading is a fun and potentially lucrative activity that can be done from the comfort of your own home. You may win free coins in cryptocurrency tournaments by doing what you do best: trading cryptocurrencies. As a result, tournaments have become a popular way to gain free bitcoin, which you can spend on your favorite websites or use to generate interest and grow your portfolio.

Many cryptocurrency platforms provide competitions in which you may compete against other traders and win coins if you are the best trader each month. Others may encourage you to find bugs in code or learn a new trade skill to move you out of your comfort zone and enhance your talents. A cryptocurrency tournament has everything you're searching for!

There are more secure methods for satisfying our wants and winning that will save you time and worries. There appears to be a common thread among these companies that claim to pay you to trade on their platforms or exchanges. In most cases, it's a fake, or you'll get given once and lose twice as much. However, as a risk-taker, I elected to compete in LOT TRADE tournaments. The creators have promised to reward anybody who just makes one deal on Binance using their platform. The range was visible and easily accessible to all attendees. They hold frequent contests with prize pools of $5,000, $10,000, and $25,000 USD. Traders who do not take any slots are entitled to a portion of the remaining pool. And guess what? That's correct! I made $70 for acquiring MATIC and reselling it the next day for a 4% profit. It's difficult to fathom, but I guess it's part of the marketing strategy until the project becomes too enormous. However, over 150 traders are presently competing in a single tournament. You may even sign up for all three at the same time and receive all three prizes.

These gentlemen have announced their intention to hold one-of-a-kind tournaments with increased awards and competition. Simultaneously, they will issue a fixed number of different grade NFTs, ensuring participation in these events, up to 55% APY, and a portion of the prize pool.",t1wb32,2022-02-26 12:45:35,DreamilyAnnoying,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/t1wb32/new_nft_collection_from_lottrade/,49,0,0,49,0,t1wb32,post
CryptoArt,🚀CryptoPunks Second Sale Minting Live Now // Easy 100x,"* **SECOND PRESALE LINK:** [https://cryptopunks-nft.com/](https://cryptopunks-nft.com/)

10,000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The project that inspired the modern CryptoArt movement. Selected press and appearances include Mashable, CNBC, The Financial Times, Bloomberg, MarketWatch, The Paris Review, Salon, The Outline, BreakerMag, Christie's of London, Art|Basel, The PBS NewsHour, The New York Times in 2018 and again in 2021. The Cryptopunks are one of the earliest examples of a ""Non-Fungible Token"" on Ethereum, and were inspiration for the ERC-721 standard that powers most digital art and collectibles.

THE SECOND SALE JUST WENT LIVE, THE LAST TIME CRYPTOPUNKS SOLD OUT AND THE PRICE 1000x

THIS IS THE SECOND AND LAST TIME CRYPTO PUNKS WILL BE MINTABLE!!!

**DETAILS:**

* 10,000 Unique NFTs
* 0.8 ETH per NFT
* 10 Per Wallet
* Last time the floor price did 100x
* Secondary Marketplace: Opensea

**MORE INFO:**

The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on etherum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Now they must be purchased from someone via the marketplace that's also embedded in the blockchain. Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale. Below, you'll find information about the status of each Punk in the market. Punks with a blue background are not for sale and have no current bids. Punks with a red background are available for sale by their owner. Finally, punks with a purple background have an active bid on them.

See the **marketplace instructions** below to acquire your very own punk. You should also join discord which includes a bot that announces all bids, offers and sales in realtime.",s73vj9,2022-01-18 18:14:22,johpendai,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'MINTING LIVE NOW'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/s73vj9/cryptopunks_second_sale_minting_live_now_easy_100x/,49,0,2,49,0,s73vj9,post

CryptoArt,,"Oh I dont know... Good question! I feel that fudd would be devastated if he succeeded in killing duh wabbit. he's too blinded by his rage to see the underlying love that has always been there. I feel the overly detailed rendering really cements the gravity of the emotion of grief. Looney Tunes was is my very first memory of falling in love with cartoons. Like a lot of people, I used to wake up very early every saturday morning for cartoons,  in highschool I would leave parties early so I could wake up early enough.

CryptoArt,📈 New AI NFT Project With Utility Backed by Bluechip Crypto Billionaire and Bored Ape🐵,"😮 The project is a members only NFT collective focused on Artificial Intelligence. The collectives first project in the collection is called ""Text2Art"". It is a first and only of it's kind in the NFT space.

&#x200B;

🔥As far as I'm concerned the project gives the user immediate utility.  I used the AI generator to build these works of art by just typing phrases into the Discord chat bot. It was very easy to use, I just typed in ""/generate Dancing Alien Starship with Bright Neon Flowers"" and a minute later the AI/Machine Learning software would churn out a piece of art. The tech is absolutely insane. What's crazy is that most of the art actually works as a composition and makes sense. Check out some of the art I was able to come up with below.

&#x200B;

Art Generated Using [Bored.AI](https://Bored.AI)

&#x200B;

[imgur.com/a/JwgO9Xg](https://imgur.com/a/JwgO9Xg)

&#x200B;

😍 So after playing with it and loving the tools, I deep dove into it a little bit more. The project is led by one of the founders of Bancor (a [CoinMarketCap.com](https://CoinMarketCap.com) Top 200 BlueChip). Team is stacked with AI/Machine Learning wizards. There's over 80 Board Ape Yacht Club Members involved. It looks like a seriously cool passion project trying to change the NFT game. So far from what I've tested i'm very boolish on this.

&#x200B;

🚙 ROADMAP 🚙

[✅Bored.AI](https://✅Bored.AI) Memberchip - Access to future upgrades - ACTIVE AND ROLLED OUT

[✅Bored.AI](https://✅Bored.AI) Text2Art Floppy Disk NFT - Art Mint Function and Generator - ACTIVE ROLLED OUT

[❎Bored.AI](https://❎Bored.AI) Text2Art Boosts - 3D Functionality and Other Features - COMING SOON

[❎Bored.AI](https://❎Bored.AI) PFP Generator - Metaverse Persona Generator - COMING SOON

&#x200B;

🤙 I'm told there's less than 400 whitelist spots remaining for the project (0.1eth) and the mint is happening on Thursday March 10th (0.2eth). Mint grants access to the art generator tool (use to generate art as you want) and 1 mintable NFT (incase you create something you absolutely love that you want to eternalize on-chain.) Total supply is 10,000. 

&#x200B;

🙏Looking forward to growing with this community and seeing what's coming next from the team!",t8vpf9,2022-03-07 18:22:40,fuffie_,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/t8vpf9/new_ai_nft_project_with_utility_backed_by/,45,0,2,45,0,t8vpf9,post

CryptoArt,,"It really is getting hard to keep up with all the developments. I know reddit is saturated with crypto wanting your investment, but the progress made by xxxnifty is incredible and you really should check it out. The team is very accessible and regularly takes part in video calls within telegram, twitter and clubhouse. This includes the two CEOs, the COO and many of the brand ambassadors. They share news with us directly and always deliver on their promises. They're hinting at some very big developments on the way, and I have no reason to doubt them. The market cap has grown nicely but, at under $20 million, its crazily low. The price has started creeping up again so best get on board soon.

CryptoArt,4 New NFT's supporting my Nature Mixer website,,m7a4i0,2021-03-17 20:42:05,jawanda,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Rarible'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/m7a4i0/4_new_nfts_supporting_my_nature_mixer_website/,41,0,3,41,0,m7a4i0,post
CryptoArt,,"I wonder if there's room for something like this in the crypto art world?

Each Nature Mixer token corresponds with a video from my website [NatureMixer.com](https://NatureMixer.com), and by purchasing the token you become the sole Conservator for that ""Nature Mix"" and are credited on the website (if you so desire). 

I've been working on a bunch of ideas to fund this passion project of mine and hopefully keep it free, and NFT's seem like a really cool option. If it goes well I will create a new NFT for every Nature Mix on the site (currently 34).

Here's the rest of the Nature Mixer Tokens so far: [https://rarible.com/naturemixer](https://rarible.com/naturemixer)

I'm interested to hear any feedback, I know this is very different than most of the content on the NFT markets.",gra1wn4,2021-03-17 20:45:19,jawanda,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/m7a4i0/4_new_nfts_supporting_my_nature_mixer_website/gra1wn4/,2,0,,2,0,m7a4i0,comment
CryptoArt,,"They look cool and very NFT style. Should sell. I would say though your nature mixer site looks very outdated and needs design and ui improvements. It sounded like years of footage and endless lines of code would be more suitable to a minimal style. I thought it would choose a random footage and sounds automatically, but the buttons look ginormous and the rounded rectangle previews are like 2005 looking. I’d just make the entire site big square previews or automatically randomly generated",graoth7,2021-03-17 23:52:58,AdamGmanPhoto,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/m7a4i0/4_new_nfts_supporting_my_nature_mixer_website/graoth7/,2,0,,2,0,m7a4i0,comment
CryptoArt,,"Hey I really appreciate the feedback, on both the NFT and the Site. I AM a little old school (I've been coding for a loonnng time haha) and it definitely comes through in my designs sometimes I'm sure.  I will take your input into account.

So you're saying you think it should play a random mix each time you load the site? I have that feature implemented just need to turn it back on.

Thanks again for taking the time to check out my stuff, I usually feel like I'm working in a bubble and rarely get such detailed feedback.

Edit: If you reload the site, I JUST rolled out some new features including a slide show that cycles through the videos, and went ahead and turned the ""random mix on each page load"" feature back on (unless you've previously customized a mix in which case it might re-load because cookies)... fixed some other issues as well with this release. Thanks again for the input :)",grapgi9,2021-03-17 23:58:36,jawanda,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/m7a4i0/4_new_nfts_supporting_my_nature_mixer_website/grapgi9/,1,0,,1,0,m7a4i0,comment

CryptoArt,"CURE has launched the BIGGEST NFT competition in BSC! 🔥 Over $175,000 in epic prizes! Almost reached the first tier already!🎁 Also a raffle to win a custom, branded, Harley Davidson worth $65k!","The BIGGEST ever NFT lottery in the history of crypto has begun courtesy of CURE!!! 📣

As our incredible NASCAR sponsorship begins, we are giving away over $175,000 worth of amazing prizes! 🎉 Not only will there be MacBooks, PlayStation PS5s, iPads, and iPhones, we will also be giving away not one but TWO Chevrolet Camaros!!! 🏎 There has NEVER been a competition like this in the history of BSC! And we are ALREADY about to hit the first tier!!!💰

But how does it work? 🤔 

CURE will mint up-to 10,000 NFTs, and 38 of these will be randomly and live on video, selected to win one of the prizes! The more NFTs purchased the higher the tiers will go, opening up access to more expensive items, all the way up to the best of the best - a Camaro ZL1s, in honor of what Noah Gragson will be driving during our incredible ‘Race For A Cure’ campaign!!! 🚘

Each NFT will cost 0.15 BNB to mint and there is no limit to the number you can buy as long as it doesn’t go over the total amount available. The more you buy the higher your chances of winning! 🏆 Additionally, each NFT will receive 15% CURE reflections throughout the campaign. Find our more here! 👇🏽

[https://www.race4acure.com/nft](https://www.race4acure.com/nft)

What’s all this about NASCAR? 🧐

In case you missed it CURE is partnering with none other than NASCAR!! The project will be joining forces with Kualig Race Team, with the speed demon himself - Noah Gragson - taking the wheel of the no.16 Camaro ZL1 for CURE!!!🏎

Millions of eyes are going to be on CURE as the brand wrapped car speeds around the tracks and the project takes over NASCAR’s website alongside none other than Coca Cola!!🥤

Not only that but YESTERDAY there was a FULL ‘roadblock’ takeover at [nascar.com](https://nascar.com)!! 🚧 This is to celebrate project lead Jacob and members of the team heading to Daytona to meet the team, taking a family that suffered the dramatic affects of childhood cancer! 🧡 That evening will be a big sponsored dinner with the entire race team and top investors!!! 🤝

If that wasn’t enough, CURE is having a unique and amazing motorcycle wrapped in CURE colors and emblazoned with the logo. Being designed by a top bike builder and painter in Chicago, the raffle will be hosted through RallyUp, and one lucky winner will walk away with a $65,000 motorcycle! 🏍

CURE Pay 2.1 will also be launching in the next coming weeks, meaning you can buy with a debit card, on your phone, even easier than every before!! 📲 It will soon be rolled out to other projects too, with a percentage of their taxes feeding the growth of the project! CURE is ready to blast!!🚀

Lastly, CURE Chain is prepping to go ahead with one of the best blockchain developers in the world taking the helm. CURE Chain’s future utility will change the world forever. Imagine earning royalties for every time researchers used your ANONYMOUS healthcare data? This is just the tip or the most revolutionary iceberg the world has ever seen! 🧨

Want to know more about this amazing charity project? Then come find out more!

CURE is the ONLY token created and backed by a real charity, founded in 2016 💖 So far we have raised over $400,000 with a goal of a further $10k being raised every single day, help us get there. 😇 

CURE aims to use the space to truly revolutionize global healthcare, and it’s our amazing community who will help get us there. 🙏🏽 To be clear, CURE Token is NOT a meme and if that’s what you want, we aren’t for you. ⛔️",suvkuu,2022-02-17 18:24:06,opiRAMIn,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mintable'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/suvkuu/cure_has_launched_the_biggest_nft_competition_in/,43,0,9,43,0,suvkuu,post

CryptoArt,Experience a Utility-First and Community-Driven Future of NFTs with The King of Oneself," Hello beautiful people!

Check out this [article](https://medium.com/@Nicole.Muniz/experience-a-utility-first-and-community-driven-future-of-nfts-with-the-king-of-oneself-551ee9c2708e) about an amazing NFT collection in the making, quick sneak peak below, with base picture of the character and video of making the project.

*Disclamer:*

*I am part of the team, we are really trying to do something different. Really grateful if you guys and gals checked it out and saw it for yourself. Love you all, Maya <3*

# Experience a Utility-First and Community-Driven Future of NFTs with The King of Oneself

The King of Oneself is an exclusive collection of 10,000 unique NFT lions. With each piece hand drawn, meticulously detailed, and algorithmically generated, these lions stand proud and tall.

So if you’re an appreciator of art and the finer things in life, the 130+ hand drawn traits will satisfy the inner art collector within you. Owning one of the lions is a unique experience because each comes with unique traits and a trackable history of its own.

In other words, the King of Oneself is every art collector’s dream come true. But, at the same time, it is so much more. Check the [article](https://medium.com/@Nicole.Muniz/experience-a-utility-first-and-community-driven-future-of-nfts-with-the-king-of-oneself-551ee9c2708e) link to find out how this exciting new NFT collection packs a knockout punch power and delivers on its promise of an elevated NFT experience.

So I knew instantly I had to create a piece, showcasing my experience from the Citadel.",gscgqva,2021-03-26 22:10:57,Marz_Psd,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/mduq9o/visions_from_the_citadel_cell_me_2021/gscgqva/,3,0,,3,0,mduq9o,comment

Pirates of the Caribbean coast

Is a collection of NFT created by a father and his 10-year-old daughter Jonathan and Yumi. The project began as an idea to help children with cancer, donating a part of the proceeds and also learning from the experience of this great community. Father and daughter created all the base and trait layers for pirates, then generated 1200 unique digital collectibles programmatically using an open source Python script.

CryptoArt,Experience a Utility-First and Community-Driven Future of NFTs with The King of Oneself,"Hello beautiful people!

Check out this [article](https://medium.com/@Nicole.Muniz/experience-a-utility-first-and-community-driven-future-of-nfts-with-the-king-of-oneself-551ee9c2708e) about an amazing NFT collection in the making, quick sneak peak below.

[King of Oneself art](https://i.redd.it/4xl1c17w7rk81.gif)

*Disclamer:*

*I am part of the team, we are really trying to do something different. Really grateful if you guys and gals checked it out and saw it for yourself. Love you all, Maya <3*

[The King of Oneself](https://www.kingofoneself.com/) is an exclusive collection of 10,000 unique NFT lions. With each piece hand drawn, meticulously detailed, and algorithmically generated, these lions stand proud and tall.

So if you’re an appreciator of art and the finer things in life, the 130+ hand drawn traits will satisfy the inner art collector within you. Owning one of the lions is a unique experience because each comes with unique traits and a trackable history of its own.

In other words, the King of Oneself is every art collector’s dream come true. But, at the same time, it is so much more. Check the [article](https://medium.com/@Nicole.Muniz/experience-a-utility-first-and-community-driven-future-of-nfts-with-the-king-of-oneself-551ee9c2708e) link to find out how this exciting new NFT collection packs a knockout punch power and delivers on its promise of an elevated NFT experience.

How can we help offset or reduce this to more reasonable levels?

Focus on quality over quantity.

Discuss of prices with the collectors instead of setting up auctions and list prices.

Prioritize ethical platforms.

the xDai blockchain uses a proof-of-stake consensus method so both the cpu usage and gas fees  are incredibly lower. Also it uses a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar so not only NFTs environmental and crypto prices are lower, but it is also possible to know what you are spending without caring about the fluctuations of the currency.

CryptoArt,,"renewable power is not an excuse for waste consumption. Every new windmill or solar farm costs money and the entire electric grid needs to support the ups and downs of renewables. The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow.

A better solution is to increase renewable and lower consumption at the same time. With a proof-of-stake consensus you can do just that (as suggested by the article). That is why me and my company have launched a marketplace for NFT using this technology.

It is incredibly cheaper and more sustainable as well. I have posted the link above if you are interested",gketk0c,2021-01-23 17:25:37,Alexsyo,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/l23pe8/the_unreasonable_ecological_cost_of_cryptoart/gketk0c/,1,0,,1,0,l23pe8,comment

CryptoArt,,"It's possible to tokenize cryptoart on non-PoW chains that wouldn't come close to the energy requirements of current day Ethereum - so throwing the baby out with the bathwater might not be the best choice.

Is this damning? Absolutely. Can it be solved? Yes, and it needs to be done quickly.

Self serving as a lot of cryptocurrency related behaviour tends to be, there is a genuine need for a venue for cryptoart to flourish. If it were to suddenly die off because nobody wants to face the hard truths about energy consumption and _do better_, it would be an incredible loss.

Besides, let's not pretend that DeFi is a much much bigger culprit with regards to number of transactions generated. Trying to place the blame squarely on the shoulders of cryptoart is asinine. This is an ETHEREUM problem not an artist/collector problem.

That said, this is world shaping technology and we need to make it work for everyone. It falls to artists and platforms to take a stand on this issue and make it right, if they plan to continue participating as they do now.

Look to the growing popularity of things like NBA Topshot, and you will see that this problem is not going to just go away, and if anything it is only going to accelerate at least for the foreseeable future.

So really, we need to be having a really big conversation about this and not be trying to sweep it under any rugs (that later get pulled).",gk4pthx,2021-01-22 02:02:38,the_stabologist,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/l23pe8/the_unreasonable_ecological_cost_of_cryptoart/gk4pthx/,6,0,,6,0,l23pe8,comment

CryptoArt,,"⚡️ Highlights and FAQ: ⚡️  
  
Bad Bears Genesis: 5,555 total NFTs in the collection  
  
What are the benefits to holding a Bad Bear? Passive yield; mint pass; DAO.  
  
👉 Each Bad Bear NFT generates 100 $MSK/day in passive staking yield. Holding a Bad Bear  
acts as a membership card to the Bad Bears universe and entitles you to future NFT drops that  
come out of Bear Labs.  
  
👉 Bear Labs is scheduled to drop a serum in Q1 which will produce a one-of-a-kind Bad Cub  
that has an $MSK multiplier effect. A metaverse-ready VX Bear is in production now.  
  
👉 The Bad DAO is funded by 10% of the mint and royalties which will be invested at the  
discretion of the Bad Bears NFT holders to purchase land in the metaverse or used as  
distributions. Profits earned from investments are paid out to Bad Bears holders quarterly.  
What is Bear Labs?  
  
👉 Bear Labs periodically releases serums, viruses, and crazy tech which produce NFTs that  
will enable a multiplier on the MSK earned per day by each Bad Bear, cross-chain  
interoperability, and Metaverse integration.  
  
👉 Collaboration with A-List artists for future drops  
  
What is $MSK and what are the benefits to holding $MSK tokens ?  
  
👉 $MSK - fixed 1 Billion supply NFT utility token for the Bad Bears ecosystem and raising the  
value of every Bad Bear  
  
👉 $MSK holders meeting the minimum token requirement (to be announced) will have access  
to a crypto trading web-app never before seen in the crypto space. FOMOwallet is set to be  
released in Q2 2022.  
  
👉 $MSK holders meeting the minimum token requirement will be auto-whitelisted for Bad  
Bears Genesis and future NFT drops out of Bear Labs.

CryptoArt,,"“The old grey stone showed much sign of wear and age; cobwebs draped the halls instead of the thick rich curtains of long ago, dust lined the floors where one there were long elegant carpets and the wind howled and whistled eerily down empty halls where once the sounds of lively chatter and mirthful laughter were carried on a soft undertone of someone singing.  
Far up in one of the highest rooms that looked out over sea and land lay a beautiful woman with rich golden hair flayed around her. She was sleeping peacefully despite clad in what would quite easily pass for heavy armour whilst her hands secured her jewelled blade to her chest - almost as if she had been perfectly posed. Even here the cobwebs and dust had dared to invade, stretching their influence ever closer to the sleeping woman.  
For the apparent amount of time she had been slumbering, her armour had not lost its sheen, neither had the flamed jewel in her sword lost it's glow. It seemed that time did not pass for her as it did for everything else. Could it have something to do with the flame crest on her forehead? or maybe whatever magic kept her slumbering? Is there a way to reverse it? If so how? Maybe the answer lies not in what the cause is, nor in who is awkening her (as some charlatans might have you try to believe) but in who she is.  
The Elven woman Mirelda is who slumbers, but that is only her name, in part. A warrior of great calibre, she was not to be taken lightly on the battlefield. Her loyality to those she served and those who served beside her ran deep, and she made many allies, though she didn't always keep their company. Her fondness of roses and penchant for fire (as well as her fiesty personality) earned her much respect among her comrades.  
A beautiful rose has many thorns but sometimes one but brave those thorns. Does one need to be high born? Or playing with grubs? Just to wake Mirelda? Maybe all one needs is a rose, and some fire in their spirit.”

  
This is first of a set of NFT drops from my original art of heroines. I doubt it will sell but hopefully get to create more awareness of my work. Thanks very much in advance for your attention and support!

CryptoArt,,"I used exactly zero of the steps in that tutorial to create my animation. I don't even use Houdini. It looks like you found a tutorial for creating a 2D pattern that vaguely resembles the 3D structure I made, and you assumed that they must be somehow connected. Even if I had followed that tutorial to create a 2D pattern, it would have only helped me with about 10% of the finished product. The pattern was manually designed, but most of the actual work was spent creating a shader for the surface of the material, animating the surface to look organic, and setting up lighting.

I'm a little embarrassed that I've spent so much time trying to defend my art because you think it's ""simple"". It just pisses me off that you're justifying your mean spirited behavior by trying to claim the moral high ground with comments like ""shit like this turns my stomach"". You seem to have some sort of half-baked idea that art must be complex in order to be good, but you can't even correctly judge whether or not something is simple.",gnghfjg,2021-02-14 19:35:11,thefaketomato,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'verified-artist'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/ljfvz3/rough_endoplasmic_reticulum/gnghfjg/,2,0,,2,0,ljfvz3,comment

CryptoArt,Tired of paying so much in gas? Give GhostMarket a look!,"I’ve seen a lot of people posting about gas prices and it always goes back to everyone being on Rarible primarily.

Rarible is awesome, but I agree with most that it’s way too expensive to mint right now, especially if you’re just starting off. After a lot of research since mid January, a few weeks ago I discovered GhostMarket.

GhostMarket has its own set of wallets (Ecto and Phantasma) that are easy to download and use. They also have their own currency, SOUL and KCAL. That is truly where they stand out, as it costs around 20 KCAL to mint a single NFT and it ends up costing less than a dollar. 

On top of this, the last two weeks SOUL (the primary currency used to make purchases) has gone up in value around 200%. I sold my first two NFTs within the last week, and I started minting only a little bit before that.

There’s a wide variety of incredible artists and the team behind GhostMarket are very responsive on Discord. I felt welcomed and was able to get responses quicker, compared to other sites.

The site is still growing a community and they’re still adding a lot of features, but there’s definitely room to grow and your NFTs won’t be buried like on some sites due to the high volume of work being added.

I highly recommend giving it a try and also doing it sooner than later! If anyone has questions I’d love to help. I’m not affiliated with them as a developer or anything, just an artist who has really enjoyed using their platform and wants to see it grow. 

Also, this is meant in no way to bash other sites in any way as I enjoy all of the other platforms :) this is just a solution to the rising gas issue I see everywhere preventing new people to the space from minting, like myself.

*EDIT* The second wallet is actually called Poltergeist, Phantasma is the blockchain itself! My apologies for mixing those up.",lorrdc,2021-02-21 07:26:56,GhostCowboy92,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/lorrdc/tired_of_paying_so_much_in_gas_give_ghostmarket_a/,23,0,11,23,1,lorrdc,post
CryptoArt,,I started with mintable.app because it was the only place where I could mint for free through them. I figured it be the easiest way to start given the gas fees etc. I’m gonna check out Ghostmarket and if it’s only a dollar or 2 to mint through it may be worth it. Any other suggestions on how to gain traction in the NFT space?

CryptoArt,,"Newby here... so many questions lol... First - are these platforms interchangeable? For example, can I create on GhostMarket and then list/sell that item on other platforms as well... say, OpenSea? Seems like that would be too easy... Also, when does the gas fee come into play on these platforms? Is it when you first create/upload the item? Or after the item has sold that the NFT is created and verified for the buyer that gas fee is applied - seems like it would happen upon initial creation - maybe? Lol... This answer would make a difference if you're creating say, a series of items, in deciding when to upload and how many at a time...? Sorry if this just seems too simple. I'm sure I can find answers by ever more googling...

CryptoArt,,"Thank you friend :) 
Minting myself now but ETH costs so much. This could be a solution. 

Mintable mints once the product sells and not before I was told?  (Which doesn't sound bad for a beginner just trying to get some eth to start with) 

Checking Ghostmarket out tonight. Maybe it'll be my first mint!",gr608ux,2021-03-16 21:06:46,GetFacedet,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'verified-artist'}]",/r/CryptoArt/comments/lorrdc/tired_of_paying_so_much_in_gas_give_ghostmarket_a/gr608ux/,1,0,,1,0,lorrdc,comment

CryptoArt,,"Hey there, sorry just seeing this now.

GhostMarket is on the Phantasma Blockchain which is different than the Ethereum chain (where Rarible/OpenSea/Foundation/etc are on). This means you can’t switch over NFTs, they would only be available on GM. However, Phantasma is crosschain in terms of currency, so a side from the native currency SOUL and KCAL, you can use ETH and NEO, among a few others I believe.

Minting on GM is simple, it’s 20 KCAL (currently about $2 USD) you to mint a single piece, which charges your wallet upon minting. If you mint 20 of the same piece, the cost of KCAL decreases, rather than being 400 KCAL, which is nice. Hope this helps!",gsjc1x5,2021-03-28 01:37:57,GhostCowboy92,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/lorrdc/tired_of_paying_so_much_in_gas_give_ghostmarket_a/gsjc1x5/,1,0,,1,1,lorrdc,comment

CryptoArt,,">GhostMarket has its own set of wallets (Ecto and Phantasma) that are easy to download and use. They also have their own currency, SOUL and KCAL. That is truly where they stand out, as it costs around 20 KCAL to mint a single NFT and it ends up costing less than a dollar.

Hi, I'm a newbie here.  Thank you for sharing this info.  I'm going to experiment on both GhostMarket and OpenSea and see which is better.",hla1mhm,2021-11-19 17:33:01,RiglerDigital,[],/r/CryptoArt/comments/lorrdc/tired_of_paying_so_much_in_gas_give_ghostmarket_a/hla1mhm/,2,0,,2,0,lorrdc,comment
