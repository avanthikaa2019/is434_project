CardanoNFTs,,"I'm one of the co-founders of ***NFT-Craze*** and we're also working on a NFT MarketPlace and NFT-backed DeFi.

Our goal is to enable artists to easily launch their entire collection if they wish to. Also, we're working on using smart contracts to implement shared/partial ownership for NFTs and Decentralised P2P loans using NFTs as collateral. This would allow users to earn higher APY by lending. If the loan + interest is not paid before the deadline, the ownership of the full/partial NFT gets transferred to the lender.

If you'd like to see that, you can find us on:

CardanoNFTs,"Don't miss the rocket to the moon, buy Crypto Dino's while you still can","So those of you who have been ears to the ground looking for the next hype project struck **gold** with [Crypto Dino's](https://www.cryptodino.io/#collection). Over the past week, Crypto Dino's managed to surpass Bits to enter the top 5 projects in ADA and unit volume. It has a buzzing community full of activity that many have likened to that of Spacebuds post mint event.

In 48 hours, the floor of the most common units have more than **doubled** in price while ultra rare units **have skyrocketed into the stratosphere.** The time to get in on Dino's is **right now** before the floor doubles again tomorrow and every day after.

[40 ADA Floor for Dino's](https://preview.redd.it/5onep6ah5uk71.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b0999312cd9a5d27087b732c1103f7b5b0a508)

[Rank 5 on Top Projects](https://preview.redd.it/2srraa4xkfk71.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=9753556b2803d37cec64ae320647058673791b2a)

The best part about collecting Crypto Dino's is that each one has utility for the greater game that will be launched in the near future. For example, each handprop will have a specific gameplay element tied to it. We are expecting the developers to provide more insight into the game in the coming months and joining the [discord community](https://discord.gg/jYKk39DU) is the best way to keep up to date with any news about ongoing development.

Here is a preview of my most unique Dino that I affectionately refer to as Patrex Mahomes, QB1 for the Kansas City Dino's. As you can see the artwork is pure fire and the hype surrounding these buggers is extremely justified.

[Patrex Mahomes](https://preview.redd.it/umvjw9o9jfk71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd64a6f793abdbf6922776d4b1937d3540e25e12)

As early adopters of CNFT's we need to have each others backs and make sure we are the ones profiting from the maelstrom of ETH NFT collectors who will be rushing the flood gates come the 12th. Don't say I didn't give everyone in this lovely community a chance to **score huge ROI potential with Cyrpto Dinos.**

CardanoNFTs,Let's find out best NFTs to invest in 2022,"
GRSE NFTs may impress you. They are launching on 26th December and have an amazing collection of trippy owls. Apart from this they also have a great collection of Moon NFTs.

The best part is that NFT holders will be automatically rewarded a piece of land in the metaverse. The project is based on land on the moon entirely.

They are also working hard for the development of their game and the NFT marketplace. An interesting project that can give you good benefits.

CardanoNFTs,I just sold my First CNFT - I can't believe it,"For some context, I have sold some NFTs before on [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io) But this time it was one nft that I made of my own.

 I never thought that it would be possible, I told myself before putting it for sale on a random discord server, that it wouldn't sell because I'm a nobody, but who knows maybe It could work or not, I'll just give it a try. Today, one week later, a completely stranger came by and just told me that he wanted to buy my NFT. I just couldn't believe it. It wasn't much, 50 ADA for the NFT + a physical Vinyl of my music, but the simple fact that somebody likes and wants to support your art its simply wonderful.

Anyways, I'm shaking right now...

I'm in love with Cardano and this community.

CardanoNFTs,If you own a GRSE mythic NFT you will automatically be given Land.,"Grise Metamoonverse is a project situating its metaverse across the moon itself. If earth has become a boring place for you, remember that you now have multiple options and Grise Metamoonverse is on them.

Grise believes that our beloved Earth is depleting its
resources and there is an urgent need to shift towards bodies situated outside space.

Thus, the project inherited the idea of building up a
metaverse and dividing the acreage of the Moon into 10,000 equal pieces.

These lands can be owned by anyone. On the land you can merge with their head NFts. And create a base, these head NFts they intend on making them intelligent.

If you own a GRSE mythic NFT you will automatically be given Land. The rest of the pieces of land will be listed on sale in their marketplace.

Grise Metamoonverse also features NFT marketplace, NFT Collection, and an Al platform that unlocks countless opportunities for the moon army to function and operate around the metaverse with different capabilities.

NFTs are now being touted as the digital answer to
collectibles.

NFTs are Non-fungible assets that means it has unique properties and can't be interchanged with anything else. This can represent a digital art, music and more.

FYI, an animated Gif of Nyan Cat - a 2011 meme ofa
flying pop-tart cat sold for more than $500,000. Whereas, musician Grimes sold some of her digital for more than $6m. Christie's sale of an NFT by digital artist Beeple for $69m set a new record for digital art.

Now, GRSE NFTS are ready to hit the market on 26th
December. Its seems an interesting project to me. Their collection of NFTs include Head NFTs, Trippy Owl NFTs and Moonland NFTs.

Grise meta moonverse is based on land on the moon entirely. All of the moon will be divided into 10,000 pieces of 69.09 acre lands. These lands can be owned by anyone.

CardanoNFTs,GRSE a wonderful NFT Project with Unique Collections.,"Grise Metamoonverse is building a Metaverse and
dividing the acreage of moon into 10,000 equal pieces. Any user who owns a Grise NFT will be automatically awarded land on the metaverse.

They are also developing their game on the intersection of Starcraft and clash royale.

You will need the Land NFT to start building your base. Their initial concept and deliverable will be 3 races and each race will have 4-6 characters initially) with each character having its own set of properties.

You can use these to battle other bases to win the loot (think clash Royale).

Upcoming roadmap:

• Launch of Moon dashboard on our platform for land holders, Grise token launch on Cardano.

• Release of different characters on the moon land and different merging mechanics to make your moon land stronger.

CardanoNFTs,,"Nice work!

I did notice that the floor for The Hoskinsons is listed as ₳8, which is an unfortunate side-effect of the way CNFT.io is handling multiple collections produced by a single artist. Right now, all policy IDs are grouped together under the artist name without any way to separate them out into individual collections. The result is that our fungible tokens (hosks, kilohosks, microhosks, etc under policy ID `98dc68b04026544619a251bc01aad2075d28433524ac36cbc75599a1`) are grouped together with our NFTs (Hoskinsons under policy ID `e986d38f4ead45a4f909cb51d61d8d95efc72b12d9302cdd040974d1` and Hosk Pool under policy ID `44ae79bd8fbbcd4b7ecbf5745feaa75feb4c7be8ac5198a968528f0a` among others). The fungible tokens are usually sold for the minimum ₳8 amount, which brings the floor price down for other Hoskinsons NFTs. For comparison, the current Hoskinsons floor is about ₳50 and the current Hosk Pool floor is ₳750, which are all masked by the ₳8 hosk fungible tokens.

Not sure of the best way to address this. Bigger picture, I think the data structure CNFT.io is using at https://github.com/Cardano-NFTs/policyIDs could be improved to allow an NFT artist to specify a collection name for each policy ID instead of grouping them all together. This would allow floor prices for each collection to be tracked separately.

For example, something like this. I'm sure more fields could be added, too (e.g., website, twitter, etc):

    {
        ""artist"": ""The Hoskinsons"",
        ""projects"": [
            {
                ""name"": ""Project1"",
                ""policies"": [ ""policy1a"", ""policy1b"", ""policy1c"" ]
            },
            {
                ""name"": ""Project2"",
                ""policies"": [ ""policy2a"", ""policy2b"", ""policy2c"" ]
            },
            {
                ""name"": ""Project3"",
                ""policies"": [ ""policy3a"", ""policy3b"", ""policy3c"" ]
            }
        ]
    }

Ideally there would be a way for artists to get verified and then update their data themselves instead of requiring CNFT.io to do it manually. It would be nice if a third-party maintained this database that CNFT.io and other marketplaces could pull from. Or multiple independent databases, or even better, this data could be published on the chain, but now I'm dreaming.

In the short term, what are your thoughts on how to fix the ₳8 floor issue? I suppose one fix would be to break our project up into several separate projects, each with its own entry in https://github.com/Cardano-NFTs/policyIDs

Keep up the great work. We appreciate it.

Update: I'm separating The Hoskinsons into separate projects on github for now.

CardanoNFTs,GRSE NFT is worth to get your attention.,"GRSE NFT is now live for minting. You can directly visit their website and can buy a NFT of your choice. They have a huge collection of Moonland NFTs and Trippy Owl NFTS.

FYI, Grise meta moonverse is based on land on the
moon entirely. All of the moon will be divided into 10,000 pieces of 69.09 acre lands. These lands can be owned by anyone.

On the land you can merge with their head NFts. And create a base, these head NFts they intend on making them intelligent.

If you own a GRSE mythic NFT you will automatically be given Land. The rest of the pieces of land will be listed on sale in their marketplace.

Now if you want to sell your NFT after buying, you just have to follow a simple process.

After you own the GRSE NFT it will appear in your my CNFT tab this can be accessible by clicking on your connected NAMI wallet button and then clicking on my CNFTS.

You will then see all your GRSE NFTs. And you can place them on sale directly by clicking on sell

CardanoNFTs,,"Its different for every project. The reason it takes so long is that they are moving all database tables, schemas, and data to a completely new database in one go. This is enough to make any DBA nervous. Not only that they have to do extensive check out after to make sure that everything moved correctly. If a database table is move but the indexes did not move with it then you'll still have a performance issue. If data is accidentally duplicated it could lead to unforeseen issues with APIs and the UI. In my experience i have see database migrations last from a few hours to an entire weekend.

CardanoNFTs,Let's find out if you can make money from blockchain NFT/crypto games.,"Yes definitely. In fact, IMO, this is the best time to invest in a NFT project. FYI, there are many NFT projects that have already given some good returns to the investors.

NFTs are the evolution of the digital art. If you are looking for a potential as well as unique NFT project then you must check out Grise Metamoonverse.

Grise is building a metaverse and dividing the acreage the moon into 10,000 equal pieces. Any users who owns a Grise NFTs have been automatically awarded land on the metaverse.

They are also working on the development of their game and the NFT marketplace, all under the same roof.

CardanoNFTs,Own Land on Moon with GRSE NFTs,"Grise Metamoonverse is a project situating its metaverse across the moon itself. If earth has become a boring place for you, remember that you now have multiple options and Grise Metamoonverse is on them.

Grise believes that our beloved Earth is depleting its resources and there is an urgent need to shift towards bodies situated outside space. 

Thus, the project inherited the idea of building up a metaverse and dividing the acreage of the Moon into 10,000 equal pieces.

These lands can be owned by anyone. On the land you can merge with their head NFts . And create a base, these head NFts they intend on making them intelligent.

If you own a GRSE mythic NFT you will automatically be given Land. The rest of the pieces of land will be listed on sale in their marketplace.

Grise Metamoonverse also features NFT marketplace, NFT Collection, and an AI platform that unlocks countless opportunities for the moon army to function and operate around the metaverse with different capabilities.

How about in real-estate being used as the virtual home tour.  Bought and sold for realtors and home owners.  Town home info.  something in that area.

Also my wife did a lot of arts and crafts.  One of the items was a device called a cricket.  Which uses these design patterns that gets sold on e-bay all the time.  It's written in a way that the machine uses.  Maybe we can get some interoperability with that. Even those have limited editions.

We are doing a final limited drop of our CryptoDoggies NFTs. If you still don't have one, and love dogs - don't miss a final chance!

It will last for 1 day only (from Saturday 8 AM EST), or until all 200 doggies find their new digital loving home.

Oh, and a short reminder - 50% of the sale goes to dog shelter charities across the world. Buy a crypto doggie, help us save a real doggie!

Our team sends huge hugs and thanks to all the participants of our project, we've already donated to two dog shelter charities this month!

Not too difficult producing these kind of clay figures. Even less difficult producing hundreds of NFTs from.

Comparing the difficulty producing a fcking clay figure to producing a Rolex watch? Really?

The brand name of that clay figure producer still has to proof its value.

CardanoNFTs,,"[Wild Warriors NFTs](https://twitter.com/WildWarriorsNFT?t=esLcCIN0jQ-iO4ZzE5mKbQ&s=09) will be dropping the 2nd half of their first mint on Saturday November 6th, 2021 at 11:45 EST (08:45 PST, 10:45 CST, 15:45 UTC). You can find all the information here: [Roadmap](https://www.wildwarriors.io/roadmap). The reasoning behind having two halves of one mint was due to network congestion. The Wild Warriors team had to pause minting as not all transactions were making it through. You can read more about the situation of the network congestion of the first mint half [here](https://www.wildwarriors.io/congestion).

Spearheading the Wild Warriors project is none other, Cardano supporter, [ADAape](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe?t=ULdJ2gpOlSSKYrqWTX780A&s=09) with amazing art by [Foeniculum](https://twitter.com/ERGnomes?t=_mCHY7K02eb1RU1dXbBHAg&s=09). You can find more information on the team here: [Wild Warriors Team](https://www.wildwarriors.io/team).

We have a Discord server with a great community, if you would like to join. There's a giveaway currently happening on the server. You have a chance to win 1 of 3 Warriors. Yes, you heard that right, 3 possible chances at winning a Wild Warrior NFT. All you have you to do is join the Discord (if you already haven't), click an emoji and you will be entered into the giveaway. Take a look for yourself!

CardanoNFTs,Welcome to the Adamance project! The Adamance Metaverse is where almost everything is a CNFT.,"

Welcome to the Adamance project! The Adamance Metaverse is where almost everything is a CNFT.

Bring the metaverse to the Carnado blockchain, not your grandfather's crypto project. Metaverse can be an overused word, but when I look at this project, I think it's a fair assessment from onboarding CNFT artists to pushing forward on their metaverse. Finally, someone(could even be you) owns everything you look at. They are giving you a great chance to build your own world by yourself or with friends, not too dissimilar to Habbo Hotel. Not saying they are going for a clone, mind you. But I think we can all agree that inspiration and aspiration are essential. Is the whole world going to be ready out of the box? No, but I think we have all seen projects promise the world right out of the gate and fail to deliver. Collecting the goals one by one is the way to go IMO. Come get in on the ground floor.

CardanoNFTs,"Just finished my first drop of 99 Cardano NFTs, here to share my experience...","TL:DR; Sharing my experience. In August 2021 I was just one artist painting dragons. On September 9, 2021, I made a Twitter account for my project. By September 21-23, after some hiccups with 3 separate drops, they are all sold out. I'm now an artist with a fledgling community.  

\[August 2021\] I started painting dragons because I needed to paint something to get out of the rut that my brain was swirling in.

\[Late August 2021\] A friend said I should share them, so they get released into the world. I started a TikTok for my artwork, it was fun but didn't get too much interest. I didn't even care, I was painting, that's all that mattered.

\[1 September 2021\] My friend mentioned NFTs on Cardano. I thought I'd try minting the 9 dragons I painted as Cardano NFTs and selling them. I figured I'd be happy with 250-300 ADA for each, and that would be it. So I started researching.

After some research, I figured 9 was too low, and since I was no generative artist, I could not afford to make more than 100 manually. I decided I would release 99 dragons instead of 9 and change the price to 25 ADA each.

\[7 September 2021\] [Tokhun.io](https://Tokhun.io) launched its marketplace. I saw it on my newsfeed randomly, compared a few other minting/marketplace services like [EasyCNFT.art](https://EasyCNFT.art), and even [Artano.io](https://Artano.io). I decided that because Tokhun lets me easily make my own policy (least programming for a simple artist like me), it would be my choice.

\[9 September 2021\] Started my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dracanoart), set up a [website](https://dracano.com) to the best of my layman abilities, and picked a launch date: 21 Sep, 2021. It would be a Tuesday, low traffic, and I could list all my 'Dracanos' on Tokhun and let it sit for a few months before sales start coming in.

I started a 'giveaway' where the winner and a friend would each get the first 2 editions of my artwork.

\[10 September 2021\] (Approximately 50 Twitter followers) I got to work on the nitty-gritty... made a policy ID on [Tokhun.io](https://Tokhun.io) and then submitted it to [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io)'s GitHub for verification. I also sent a submission to WenCNFT with my launch date.

\[11 September 2021\] (100+ Twitter followers) I got a message in my Twitter DM from a YouTuber who saw my project on WenCNFT and was interested in talking about utility and the outlook of my project.

So this made me take a real hard look at my own project. I like world-building, so I know I can create a world and a community for these creatures. I may not have the resources to create a game yet, but I may in the near future. I also knew I wanted to paint, and that should be the core of it all.

I would not pump this project, I would not set rarity, I would not even keep any of the first 99. I wanted to find like-minded people organically, they will take care of my dragons, and the community will decide on what's rare, what's good, and what's collectible.

\[14 September\] (500+ Twitter followers) The YouTube video came out, and I was over the moon. It's the first time I've ever been on the platform. I was contacted by other new creators also getting into the CNFT space. People started DMing me, and I would answer them as quickly as I could.

By this time, I had started posting my ""work in progress"" videos. I like them for myself because it shows me how I paint (like an athlete re-watching a video of his performance to see where he could improve). It turns out that people also like seeing these, and it proves that I actually made the artwork.

A few more content creators hopped in, I felt extremely lucky for each and every bit of interest. 

\[20 September\] I went on Tokhun and added about 400 ADA to my Tokhun wallet and started minting 99 dragons, one by one. It took a few hours because I added descriptions and metadata manually. The description for each set of dragons added lore to my universe, and that was important to me.

\[21 September\] (1000+ Twitter followers) Launch day!

I woke up with a Tokhun announcement on Twitter: Maintenance today! 

Apparently, Tokhun also saw that Tuesday was a low-traffic day and decided they would do surprise maintenance, timed two hours after my scheduled launch time. I thought... well, two hours seems like enough time for me to list.

I was wrong.

I listed my first dragon at exactly 10 a.m. UTC (as planned). It immediately sold.

About two minutes later, I was able to list another. It sold too!

Something great was happening, but I could only manage to list one for sale every 2-5 minutes. I did keep going. I'm just an artist, I wasn't trained to handle situations like these.

People were messaging their frustrations on Twitter, advising to move to the other famous Cardano NFT platform. So when Tokhun went into maintenance at 12 a.m. UTC, I announced that I'll do what I can to move to [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io).

\[22 September\] (1300+ Twitter followers) Following the advice of my own community, I started a [Discord](https://discord.gg/sXDBZ3WmQ8). Because things were beginning to become unmanagable on Twitter for one person. I needed a place to put all the announcements together and a website wouldn't let me engage directly with people.

I set a new time: Drops will be on [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io), once at 5 a.m. UTC and again at 5 p.m. UTC (to facilitate the people in my community living in different time zones).

By this time (two weeks later) I was still unverified by [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io) and from the sale yesterday, there were already fakes of my artwork up on the website. I tried messaging [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io) on this, but expected no reply. I figured this was beyond my control, but I could do my best to warn people to check my policy ID.

People who did get some dragons prior helped me a lot. The community spread the word, and retweeted. Some volunteered to help me with Discord because I was (admittedly) a certified noob. 

\[23 September\] (1500+ Twitter followers)

Launch 1.2 was here, and I started to time myself by releasing 2-3 artwork every 30 seconds or so to help avoid potential bots (I had no idea there were bots, but the community advised so, and I followed).

Guess what? [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io) accepts multiple purchases for the same NFT. I try to send the artwork from my wallet directly to the first buyer as soon as I get the notification. I don't like to keep people waiting, in all honestly, and I firmly believe people should get what they pay for.

The problem was... people were paying and not getting. Some people are still just discovering now (hours later) that they are not going to get the artwork they reserved.

Launch 1.3 later in the day had the same fervor and the same disappointment. 

This time, [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io) lagged and did not send me 'buy' notifications immediately. I ended up needing to sift through dozens of pages in order to find the first instance of a buy after the instance of my listing.

In the whirlwind, I accidentally listed one for 15 ADA instead of 25 ADA (heh). Since it was my bad, I sent it to the buyer anyway.

\[24 September\] Today, I'm resting a little from all the excitement of the past few days. Letting my brain refresh and I intend to steadily keep this project growing. My community is playing a big role in helping me grow, going forward. 

I am fully verified on Tokhun but still unverified on CNFT. 

Overall, it was the best learning experience I could have asked for. I jumped straight in, stayed afloat mostly on good luck and the kindness of strangers, and I will keep going for the foreseeable future.

I started writing all this down for my own memory and then I realized it might benefit other smaller projects and artists if I posted it publicly. Hello Reddit! Thanks for reading. Feel free to get in touch with me. I'll try to answer any questions, and if you have advice, I will gladly listen.",pucojh,2021-09-24 04:51:35,DracanoArt,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pucojh/just_finished_my_first_drop_of_99_cardano_nfts/,46,0,27,46,3,pucojh,post

CardanoNFTs,,"Thanks for the encouragement! What I do is nothing extraordinary, I paint what I naturally see first - shapes and light, so everything is done in grayscale then colors come later. I have 9 base species of dragons that all have different patterns and coloring. I also change details on each of them so that no two are exactly the same (even if you put them back into black and white) before officially minting.

""Items"" was something I considered too, but it didn't suit my art style. I wanted full-color paintings of baby dragons that each looked like they were drawn from scratch. 

I use a second-hand iPad 10.5 (2017) with Adobe Fresco, Procreate, and I do most of my final inspection in Photoshop to correct color and tone. It is admittedly a manual process, one that I find very rewarding when I see the end result.",he2ffa9,2021-09-24 08:03:02,DracanoArt,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Artist'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pucojh/just_finished_my_first_drop_of_99_cardano_nfts/he2ffa9/,5,0,,5,0,pucojh,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"Royalties are still a little tricky in the Cardano NFT space. There's ""777"" that has been established by several members of the community in regards to royalty ([https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/116/files](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/116/files)), and that's a great start.

But not all platforms support it (as of today). So you may get your royalty if your buyer resells your art on one platform, but not on another platform.

[Tokhun.io](https://Tokhun.io) has a minting process that helps you implement royalty into the policy ID. [Artano.io](https://Artano.io) is working on a solution for artists to easily mint and sell. There are a few others that can help you as well, depending on the type of project you're looking to create.",he2g2t8,2021-09-24 08:12:54,DracanoArt,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Artist'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pucojh/just_finished_my_first_drop_of_99_cardano_nfts/he2g2t8/,4,0,,4,0,pucojh,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Thanks too, my Season 2 drop, currently happening, is done through a Discord lucky draw system. I have a small supply, not enough to meet demand. So this system works best for now.

Depending on your technical skills, you might want to look at blockfrost.io or nft-maker.io pro and link their API to your website.

If you’re purely artistic, apply to Artano.io, they’re gearing to become the Superrare of Cardano. 

Marketplace sites like tokhun.io will help you get started quickly too, if you need a selling platform and you’re planning to do marketing on your own.

CardanoNFTs,How to mint tokens with cardano-cli - a complete walkthrough,"I’ve noticed more and more would like to make their own tokens or NFTs in cardano but lack the knowledge as to how to so.

All of the walkthroughs and guides I’ve found were just an amalgamation of commands, some of which made no sense to me, especially with the high readability of address hashes etc.

So I’ve made my own guide: https://link.medium.com/h2E7j0UsSfb


I’ve put a lot of time and effort into this and tried to not only provide the necessary commands but also some background information and explaining key facts you need to know. Because in my opinion - you should at least have some sort of understanding of what your doing.

It covers minting token, sending them to another address and burning token, all with in depth explanations and screenshots.

I hope this helps anybody wanting to get into Cardano and have full control over their policy and tokens. 

If there’s anything missing or you came across some errors, please let me know!

Cheers

CardanoNFTs,,"Side note, 'burned' NFTs become unplayable (can't go on adventures) ghost characters in your tavern, their NFT will show up as a tombstone, which will still be tradable. 

If you have a grandmaster adventurer (only 10,000 minted) if they fail the adventure, they will not die but go back to you tavern to recuperate. I believe they are all able to be leveled in some way. 

Taverns will be able to be visited by other players, talk of selling/providing goods as certain taverns will be tied to certain areas for certain quest. Look at it like worlds, if you want to quest on a different world for an item, you need to stay at a tavern in the world. 

Pretty grand plan, will love to see how well it's pulled off. Showed up late so was only able to pick up furniture packs. Will be waiting for next series drop next year.

Also if you like this, look into Cardano Warriors. Just found out about them yesterday. Wish I'd known back when they showed up on the scene 5 months ago so I could've gotten in on the minting. But pixel RPGs are the way to be, especially since there's been a resurgence in DND over the past few years, so I don't see a lack of interest in either of the projects.",hg0ahq7,2021-10-09 18:11:09,SigSalvadore,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/q4ogqx/drunken_dragon_games_will_be_about_owning_and/hg0ahq7/,8,0,,8,0,q4ogqx,comment

At this point I'm just looking for NFTs I think will be have airdrops and NFTs that benefit early adopters of chains and such.

The NFT stake pool is a great idea and way to invest in the project though. There's not enough information in my eyes to justify buying up NFTs, but delegation is just a risk of lost opportunity elsewhere which is super palatable for this situation. 

This project seems like moonshot. I like the graphics, but nobody has any idea what kind of game this will be. It could be an incredible rogue-like ARPG, or it could be a clicker with very little to actually do.

The grandmaster adventurers are characters you can buy and use for quests when the game is operational. They are capped at 10k and they wont make anymore.

Pixel tiles are like cards in a pack. There's furniture for your inn (you will operate an inn as part of the game later) and playable characters as well. They will release more pixel tile packs in different sets later. 

Gmas are typically worth more and can't die, as opposed to the pixel tiles which can die during quests and have a greater supply.",hg3m0bl,2021-10-10 13:14:20,SearcherRC,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/q4ogqx/drunken_dragon_games_will_be_about_owning_and/hg3m0bl/,1,0,,1,0,q4ogqx,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"You will earn additional NFT's (loot,bonuses, etc.) by completing quests. Basically, the game is a mix ofresource management with rpg questing. You own a tavern (no cost to own atavern, avail to all who play) and your tavern can be enhanced withfurniture and pixel characters (bars, tables, bar maids, inn keepersetc.) The better your tavern, the better the quests available to youradventurers. You will have either regular adventurers (which can die onquests) or have a GMA (Grandmaster Adventurer) which cannot die onquests - Your adventurers complete quests (teams of 5)to gain resources for your tavern.

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey Reddit community,

There is project myself and my team have been working on that we are immensely passionate about. 

We are releasing out first set of hand drawn Space Squids NFT due to arrive in the Cardano system early December 2021. We have a gargantuan year planned out for 2022, with the release of our first Space Squids graphic novel rollout begining in Q1 2022 and the release of our new game Squidverse due in Q4 2022 there’s certainly enough to keep the community busy. 

Our graphic novel will be sure to immerse you into our crazy world of sci-fi fiction without revealing any spoilers we are pretty sure you guys will be satisfied.

Squidverse will be a play to earn game spanning multiple galaxies where holders can battle each other using any tool in there arsenal from all Space Squid collections.

There are more than 10 different Squid Skins to collect, and over 100 accessories to bag. Every Squid will be a completely unique 1/1 piece.

We our very serious about giving back over here at Space Squids which is why 5% off all funds raised will be donated to a charity primarily focused on ocean cleansing and clean up, we believe we should set an example to all future generations and look after the place we call home. With future donations being chose by holders. Also we’re all about rewarding our own which is why all holder will have royalties from all sales split with them 50/50 just to show how much you guys mean to us and how much we value you guys.

If you are interested in NFT's, and in particular Cardano NFT's then we would love it if you guys checked us out, we are pretty sure you will not be disappointed.

Full roadmap available on our official website: www.SpaceSquidsNFT.com

CardanoNFTs,,"Smart contacts can execute on-chain logic in a clear, open and verifiable way.

1 example:

If you buy an NFT without a smart contract which mints at the point of purchase, you're trusting what the creater says the odds are - and if you'll even get it.

With a smart contract the public can verify what will happen, what the odds are, etc.

Another example:

Smart contacts can allow games and other logic with NFTs. Common examples would be breeding or fighting. There's one where you will use your NFT for adventures and they can ""die"".

CardanoNFTs,,"**Drunken Dragon Games** is a **Game Company** that uses crypto to increase the fun, and not a **Crypto Company** that uses gaming for financial purposes. Their main goal is to create an immersive and epic universe where people can share their love for fantasy. All else are tools to achieve that. 

The game will be divided into two modes: **Collector's Mode** *(Eternal Realms)*, and **Adventure Mode** *(Mortal Realms)*. 

**Collector's Mode** is now playable in alpha stage. It's currently a simple diorama for you to decorate and show off your collection. And it'll come alive in the future with animations and utility. 

**Adventure Mode** has yet to be released. It'll be the main game where you can quest, progress and expand your collection in a vast world filled with dangers and high risks, but also high rewards. 

We hope to see you in the tavern, adventurer! 🍺

CardanoNFTs,PSA: All cNFT minters and mintees should be aware of this 1 Tx workaround!,"Due to eUTXO model, 1 Tx limit is bypassed by savvy dev turned ""white hat"". Twitter user ChessCardano reported that he is using the multi-output functionality of Cardano's eUTXO model to ""easily"" mint more than 1 NFT in a single transaction, despite limits placed by minters.

**NOTE:** This does **NOT** allow mintees to avoid paying full price for all minted NFTs but it **DOES** allow them to only pay a single transaction fee **AND** get around the 1 NFT per Tx limit that is commonly placed on most drops.

It is also important to note that this is not a ""bug"" or issue with Cardano. This is a result of Cardano's transaction model and is an expected outcome of the extended unspent functionality. Realistically, utilizing THIS method of transaction creation for NFT minting would help resolve a lot of the network congestion issues we see as it reduces the total amount of transactions within each NFT mint.

I recommend that ANY would-be bulk NFT minter or any upcoming NFT mint which you may be following, seriously consider pausing their scheduled mints to modify their project to accommodate for this. Various devs within the Twitter replies have already made recommendations on this, including validating mintees by stake key to ensure a single NFT is provided regardless of total ADA sent.

I've attached a screenshot of his multi-tweet explanation and provided the link below if you want to review further. [https://twitter.com/ChessCardano/status/1463179362275049479?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChessCardano/status/1463179362275049479?s=20)

CardanoNFTs,Cardano NFTs are starting to get incredibly cool!,"I have recently jumped into the world of NFTs after first not caring as I found them all so boring and similar.

That was until I cam across CardanoTrees. [(Their Twitter)](https://twitter.com/CardanoTrees?s=20) The first full on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain. They change based on so many things like the time of year, weather, day and night cycles at their location, if it is time to flower or have fruit etc. They grow and will never stop growing.  They are not static images, gifs or videos... they are trees growing on the fly based on time. [Pool.pm Demo tree](https://pool.pm/386707e1dd9ae353a49480c576a680266e48737be00c1515ec3e715d.CTDemo04) This is just plain cool.  


A few days later I found out about Stellar hood Project.  The first interactive, fully onchain programmed and executed next gen Cardano NFT [Official Website](https://stellarhood.com/). Trading card collectables of solar systems based of real astronomical data, has a galactic interactive map, made by a real PhD physicist [(his twitter)](https://twitter.com/EgonFX?s=20), you can rename your systems and more also. [Here is one of mine](https://pool.pm/91acca0a2614212d68a5ae7313c85962849994aab54e340d3a68aabb.SH2775) if you want to take a look. P.S you can expand the card by pressing the blue symbol top right of the card.  


These are incredibly cool projects and I highly suggest looking into them if you are a fan of NFTs. I would also love to hear of any other unique projects that people know about. I have a few I like that I am looking into but the more unique the better! It will be crazy to see how far NFTs can go on Cardano and I can't wait!",pfm6yb,2021-09-01 04:07:45,tntthunder,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pfm6yb/cardano_nfts_are_starting_to_get_incredibly_cool/,36,0,31,36,0,pfm6yb,post

If you could check out my project, it's called SushiBytes. We wanted to bring utility to NFTs, so we've been developing some retro games that can be played directly with the NFTs in your wallet. We've successfully brought two games now to the Cardano blockchain, one game called SushiByte Catch where you use a sushi plate to catch sushis falling from the sky and another that is a pokemon inspired battle game called SushiFights, where you can level up your character by building up their experience points. Both you can play just by plugging in your wallet address. You can find more info at https://www.sushibyte.io/

We've used the technology that we've built to help other projects as well, like the CatLoaf project from Ioly. It's like a cross between a retro arcade game and a tamagotchi where you keep your kitten fed.

Today i bought two NFTs on CNFT.io 

Straight forward, fast, almost non-existing fees.

I really hope this becomes the mainstream, impressed right away from my first buys. 

These two NFTs did cost me 0,43 (~$0,80) ADA in total fees.

My first Eth NFT cost me $70 in fees..

CardanoNFTs,How I’ve sold over 600 CNFTs,"In ~45 days, I went from knowing virtually nothing about NFTs to fully minting my first 500 CNFT project, donating 1,000 ADA to charity, and currently minting a much larger project.

The purpose of this post is to simply provide the simple steps I took. I see so many people frustrated that their NFTs aren’t selling. I also have a promo offer for my current project as a thank you to the community.

1. The idea: you must have some sort of ability to create a digital asset. Whether it’s art, collectable or w.e. It all starts with the idea. I used 3D modeling programs to create high res 2D artwork. 

2. Create a theme around the idea. I wouldn’t have sold many NFTs if I just minted and posted a few to Tokhun.IO. Instead, my theme was 500 fractal “stones” from space. They were art, collectable, and eye catching. 

3. Go where the demand is. Currently, the demand is not buying individual artistic NFTs on a marketplace like Tokhun. The demand is for “flipping” NFTs to make a quick $$. I brought my art first project to the hype game by joining that community with discord and Twitter, by adding a layer of rarity to my stones (various backgrounds, colored orbs to the stones, etc).

4. Learn to “mint on demand”. Idk how to code, so I found an autominting service like easyCNFT.art. Seb is amazingly helpful and the site has been flawless. This allows you to not have to front the cost to mint, but rather mints upon receiving payment from the buyer. It automatically takes out the 3 Ada minting fee, and sends you the profits and sends the buyer the NFT.

5. Build a discord community. Before launching you have to market the project. Find your wary champions who want to help you bring more people in. Treat them well, they’re your ambassadors. Be active in your community, be friendly and answer questions. 

6. Develop a launch plan, share your project on CNFTcalendar and WenCNFT and build excitement leading to your launch. Launch your project on time and entice your buyers to share on social media and tag you in it. 

Please let me know if you have any questions about this process. Happy to help anyway I can.

PROMO: The Stars of Creation presale is live. If you mint 5 (15 Ada each) DM me on discord and I’ll send you a free one. Making your cost just 10 Ada each for some awesome space art.

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey, great post! Don't mean to hi-jack it but I do want to call out a few benefits of working with an individual minter vs a website/service. My pool offers minting services via a vending machine and have minted hundreds of thousands of NFTs for popular artists in the community. 

When you use a site like easyCNFT you actually don't have full control over CNFT features such as metadata, locked/unlocked policies etc., format of the sale itself, etc. Not to mention a lot of manual minters (such as myself) are actually cheaper than those sites that are more rigid.. I only charge on average 15% of the sales price and work with you on every step of the way. 

I have scripts that automatically generates metadata and can deploy any project in as little as two days.

CardanoNFTs,Celebrate the launch of Cardano Caricatures with an exclusive giveaway! 👈,"We're a new & innovative Cardano project that's a monthly NFT series where the community votes on which Crypto Youtubers they want to see immortalized in hilarious limited edition Caricatures 😆   


Here's what makes us unique 👇   


1️⃣  Each month, any Cardano Caricature NFT holder gets to vote from 10 of their favorite Crypto Youtubers. The top two choices by the community get to become a limited edition NFT that drops later that month! 🙌   


2️⃣  Each Caricature has 15 different variations with hidden stamps and rarities all inspired by their Youtube content 📺  Your voting power each month is based on the rarity of all of your Cardano Caricature NFTs combined! 🗳   


3️⃣  If the 1,000 NFTs sell out for a Caricature, then all NFT holders get a fine art print of the exact NFT they received 🖼  This also unlocks 1,000 more unique art prints which can be purchased exclusively with ADA 👀    


Dive into our website ([cardanocaricatures.com](https://www.cardanocaricatures.com)) & follow us on Twitter ([@AdaCaricatures](https://twitter.com/AdaCaricatures)) to stay in the know 💡  


Now to the giveaway! 👇  


Simply upvote this post and comment which Crypto YouTuber you want to see as the next Caricature and 3 people will get a random NFT before the Collection is even released!  


We launch the full Collection this upcoming Thursday (August 19th) at 9:00 AM EST!

CardanoNFTs,,"The first set of camels coming to the Cardano blockchain - Camel Club

  
Hey Cardano community,  


There's a project that I've been working on that I'm hoping you guys are going to like, its bringing the first set of algorithmically generated camels to the Cardano blockchain. Not only do we have amazing artwork and creative, unique designs, we are bringing utility to our NFT's in the format of a game that will use your own camel (with its own specific attributes) to challenge and face-off to other users within the Camel Club.   


There are over 13 different camels up for grabs, with over 80 attributes up for grabs - no two camels will be the same!  


We are guaranteeing 5% of the proceeds to go towards the Afghanistan Refugee Crisis appeal via the British Red Cross, with several one-off editions being raffled off prior to launch day with 100% of proceeds going towards helping those less fortunate via the power of ADA.  


If you are interested in Cardano NFT's then check us out and see for yourself whether its something you'd be interest in, I don't think you'll be disappointed!  https://discord.gg/h7uXCCke",hdrrf8e,2021-09-21 21:50:20,HarryEFC95,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ps8qp5/wanna_be_a_whale_check_out_the_cardano_warriors/hdrrf8e/,-1,0,,-1,0,ps8qp5,comment

I’m so happy to tell you I’ve released my 1st Cardano NFT Art! And it’s literally my first NFT!

I’m a russian artist based in Moscow. One of my paintings is hanging in a museum of Russian art. 

So I made a set of 4 Cardano Blockchain NFT carrying an image of my paintings of the sea on round canvases in PNG format.

It consists of material artworks painted in 2018-2020.

I was surprised that such a perspective cryptocurrency as ADA doesn’t have a marketplace yet.

CardanoNFTs,,"Dear Cardano NFT members, the CryptoDoggies NFT is going on sale Saturday, May 8th:

8 AM PT

11 AM ET

3 PM GMT/UTC

11 PM GMT+8

&#x200B;

You can find out more about us on:

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/doggies\_crypto](https://twitter.com/doggies_crypto) (and observe how many have endorsed us)

Discord: [https://discord.gg/FerPJp44fP](https://discord.gg/FerPJp44fP)

Our website where the sale is happening: [https://www.cryptodoggies.org](https://www.cryptodoggies.org)

&#x200B;

We aim to sell 9,000 tokens, with the next pricing model:

30 (15 ₳ donation + 15 ₳ price) -> 0 to 999

40 (20 ₳ donation + 20 ₳ price) -> 1,000 to 1,999

50 (25 ₳ donation + 25 ₳ price) -> 2,000 to 2,999

60 (30 ₳ donation + 30 ₳ price) -> 3,000 to 3,999

65 (32.5 ₳ donation + 32.5 ₳ price) -> 4,000 to 4,999

70 (35 ₳ donation + 35 ₳ price) -> 5,000 to 5,999

75 (37.5 ₳ donation + 37.5 ₳ price) -> 6,000 to 6,999

80 (40 ₳ donation + 40 ₳ price) -> 7,000 to 7,999

85 (42.5 ₳ donation + 42.5 ₳ price) -> 8,000 to 8,999

&#x200B;

While the starting tier of 30 might seem irregular, this is done to provide a more fair playground for those who buy later, and do not want the market dumping by those who buy for 10 ADA and sell the same day for profits.

You might feel like its yet another CNFT in the sea of dozens, but there are a few key differences I'd like to share with you:

&#x200B;

1 - We are the first 10,000 Cardano NFT Collection that is focused on the Charitable cause. Being first in NFT's is vital and gets time appreciation.

Cardano was created to reduce the inequality in this world, but so far other CNFT's did not capture this philosophy.

Once charitable NFTs inevitably become ""a must"" in Cardano, ours will be viewed as THE first pioneers in it.

&#x200B;

2 - Your investment is protected from flippers who buy an NFT for 10 ADA and dump it to the market the same day. Because the initial tiers do not grant instant 10x profit on dumping the market, there will be no price plummet.

&#x200B;

3 - We are here to stay. We've got endorsements by dozens of Cardano Stake Pools, leaders of Cardano, even Alessandro (SpaceBudz founder) commended our high-quality technical approach.

Adding to that, several HUGE Cardano influencers (for example Shweta - Forbes 30 Inspirational Women) that don't usually get themselves involved with NFTs endorsed us and wish us to succeed.

This is important to understand, as social approval of the Cardano community is the main driver for demand and success.

&#x200B;

4 - We are pioneering the smart contracts and will further develop and enrich our CryptoDoggies brand, and continue working on charitable causes, and the Cardano community.

&#x200B;

5 - Many followers in our Discord and Twitter are first-timers in Cardano. We focus a lot on getting promoted outside of the Cardano community. This is because we want to give to the Cardano community, rather than ""take"" from it by releasing a 1-day NFT through Google Docs.

&#x200B;

6 - We've got included into truly historical Cardano events that will stay in the blockchain forever:

Cardano Family Portrait: [https://twitter.com/doggies\_crypto/status/1390021283967115269](https://twitter.com/doggies_crypto/status/1390021283967115269)

Cardano Space (which assisted us due to belief in our project):

&#x200B;

7 - We've designed a high-performance platform that will be released to other CNFT projects. Our technical expertise involved in other promising CNFT projects will inevitably drive interest to the CryptoDoggies that pioneered this system. (we've even helped CryptoKnitties improve their code)

&#x200B;

CardanoNFTs,A pledge to improve Cardano NFTs and an official announcement of the CryptoDoggies project,"Dear Cardano NFT fans, we’d like a minute of your attention.

We’ve been here from the beginning, SpaceBudz level beginning. These guys nailed it - great art, smooth sale execution, they pioneered trading automation through the Discord. Hands down it was a success.

Then we watched at other NFTs and were (nothing less but) disappointed, upset, and even angry at the poor quality of a whole process fed to the truly dedicated fans.

This needs changing, and we decided to assemble a team of professionals in their sectors to deliver a pleasant experience to every fan. We are heavily inspired by SpaceBudz and want to further improve the quality of Cardano NFTs:

* Ensure a butter-smooth sale experience. We’ll be doing testing, publishing reports of stress tests, videos of how the process of sale will look like, and possibly even let some participants try this out themselves in a test environment.
* We have a strong belief in Cardano bringing change to the world. An absolute half of all the sales will go straight to the charities community will vote for! Let NFTs serve for a good cause.
* Improve all future Cardano NFTs. All the supporting applications, server architecture design, tools, source code will be released to the public with accompanying documentation.
* Grow Cardano NFTs community! We believe our Cardano NFT community is unfairly tight, and we will focus on advertising beyond Cardano to bring in more people into our community in general. After all Ethereum as a platform for NFTs is obsolete and environmentally unfriendly.

Our team hopes that this post explained our philosophy and what we’re aiming for! We’ll be thrilled to have any of you join our charitable cause, grow Cardan NFTs community, and participate in trading our cute doggies :)

In fact, we’ve been working behind closed doors for several weeks to ensure we have enough proof to demonstrate our strong determination to continue what SpaceBudz started - high-quality NFTs everyone desires! 

We have an active Twitter, Discord, Telegram - any social media of your liking.

Feel free to check out our website: [https://cryptodoggies.org](https://cryptodoggies.org/)",mxksyj,2021-04-24 14:15:06,stinkyfax,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mxksyj/a_pledge_to_improve_cardano_nfts_and_an_official/,30,0,3,30,0,mxksyj,post

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey r/CardanoNFTs! We here at The Hoskinsons are excited to announce the minting of our first native token cryptocurrency, the hosk. We're also working around the clock to complete the artwork for our upcoming NFT series to be released in the near future.

We're currently doing a giveaway of hosks on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/the_hoskinsons/status/1384118129475809289), so check us out there if you want. We'll also send some out to anyone here who would like a few as a special thanks to the Reddit community -- just post a Shelley era wallet address from your custodial wallet (e.g., Daedalus, Yoroi) below. No exchange addresses, please, unless you want some rando to get your hosks.

**Edit: Thank you for your interest and support! The giveaway here is now closed to new requests, but we're still going strong on Twitter. If you missed out,** [**follow us on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/the_hoskinsons) **for more chances to win free fake Internet meme money.**

Thank you to everyone who sent their dust back!

CardanoNFTs,Current status on NFTs on Cardano Blockchain to the date,"I've put the results of my research together to add some clearance on what is actually going on with NFTs on Cardano Blockchain now.

1. At the moment it's impossible to put any custom data (like image) to an Asset like NFT on Cardano Blockchain.

The NFT now can contain only the abc:

a) Policy ID like: ""1f468ec693a1016ffd463f86aa49ae83187401f64f3596aaa1be687e""

b) Asset Name like: ""79483542414141414141414c414141414142514146414141414c6530656a49""

c) ASCII String like: ""PixelCharles""

2. CryptoKids and SpaceBudz don't put their images exactly to blockchain. They just mint and sell the tokens with the custom abc above. And they states somewhere at their sites ""*This NFT* reflect *this image*"". I did not buy none of those two, but I'm pretty sure that's the way it is, becouse it's impossible to do something more. I dont have NFT from CryptoKids or SpaceBudz, please confirm, or correct me if I'm wrong.

I thinks it's not quite fair, couse I can make a webpage and state those NFTs from CryptoKids or SpaceBuds are ""*Dog*pic1.png"", ""*Dog*pic2.png"", etc. And nobudy can actually judge whom of us is right or wrong.

3.  Initially I've minted and sent two assets to the two friends of mine. One is Just a NFT with ASCII string ""PixelCharles"" and the other is the same, but I've added the image code to minting policy

with ""artwork"" :

>data:image/gif;base64,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

json property in the minting policy and the transcation fee in the last case was much more.

So I can assume the data could get into cardano blockchain, but I don't know the way to see this data. At least Daedalus Flight does not show anything and so does not Cardano Explorer.

I've got a contact of person who states he is working at IOHK and he confirmed my conclusions are correct:

    Yes I believe so ur correct. 

4. Daedalus Flight (4.0.2 so far) able to show NFTs you have in the wallet, and able to send them to anyone you want.

P.S. I've manged to embedded the 546 Bytes gif image in the set of 25 tockens with my own way, but it's out of scope of this post.

UPDATE5. SpaceBudz holds IPFS link with Metadata according u/dinogazenerd

My comment is the following:This is metadata, and the metadata is not the part of Cardano Blockchain. It's being stored at a Metadata Server and there is no the only Metadata server. Enyone can start their Metadata server, and misplace this data. As I got from documentation.

In any case Metadata is not decentralized and not going to be decentralized.From my experiments, I've got that when you sending the NFT you own, the metadata is not being transferred when you send your NFT via Daedalus Flight. The recipient will got the Token without metadata at all, if sender does not carry metadata while submitting transcation. And he can change the metadata as he will to when sending a token he own to another peer.

From my experiments, I've got that when you sending an NFT you own, the metadata is not being transferred via Daedalus Flight. The recipient will got the Token without metadata at all, if sender does not carry metadata while submitting transcation. And the sender can change the metadata as he want  when sending a token he own to another peer.

Update:

I've put together the results of my further reseach on Cardanos Native Tokens in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mg0gzt/experiment\_of\_minting\_noticeable\_amount\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mg0gzt/experiment_of_minting_noticeable_amount_of/)You can find there an exact number of how many tockens of the same kind can be minted in Cardano Blockchain.

CardanoNFTs,Workaround Cardano NFT,"I attempted to do a workaround of sorts for an NFT on Cardano.

I uploaded art to IPFS and got the content hash, you can search hashes and gain access to IPFS through Pinata.cloud

I minted 10 tokens called TriPlanet  with a locked policy ID, so no more can ever be created or burned with that same policy number. So this policy ID would be what shows it’s uniqueness. When minting the tokens I also added metadata to the minting transaction, containing the policy ID and description of the token, and the IPFS hash, edition, etc. 

When searching the token on a Cardano explorer like cardanoscan.io, the minting transaction is always available, along with metadata stored there. So the token you would hold is always able to be verified through this metadata and policy ID.

Having a url linking to the artist’s site and artwork with the policy ID available to view on the site would also help even further verifying the token. My future tokens will have this. 

I know this isn’t a rock solid NFT and I’m still playing around with it, but I can say that I have 10 tokens with unique identifiers, with a unique hash to the artwork they represent. All on the Cardano blockchain. 

TriPlanet 1st Edition, Mythic Rare, only 10 ever Minted. #1/20 of the Minimal_Designs_01 collection

If you have any questions or have any recommendations to better the future of these token I’d really like to know. Or if you are interested in getting your hands on one of these.",lzxgpj,2021-03-07 19:17:10,Sparda_Project,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Developer'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/lzxgpj/workaround_cardano_nft/,26,0,42,26,0,lzxgpj,post

CardanoNFTs,,"I was able to do some testing and able to get a truly interactive 3D NFT working, and the theme I am going for is Cyberpunk Dinosaur...I just want to get some ideas and interest from you guys to see what you think about the project I am working on.

A few idea I'm planning for for roll out road map

1. I aim to create around 10 initial variations of these, some of the designs takes inspiration from Hammerhead Shark, Aliens/Zerg, Zealot and Siege Tank...they will be called ""Founder's series"", the idea is I dont want to over exceed my investment while still able to roll out a substantially high quality NFT and not just your typical run-of-the-mill that everyone been flooding the market lately. The purpose of the initial Founder series is to help fund the project to the next stage.The Founder's Series will receive the full benefit of having their Dino fully equipped 'visually', meaning they are just for look. But later on when the rest of the development came through, they will then received their final version with comprise of Base Dino + all the weapons sets that come with it, which allows them to equip/unequip/trade...ect...The Dino will be completely in high fidelity 3D, have their own animation/poses, I am trying to add sounds as well as the next step.
2. In phase 2 there will be Genome Labs + Armoury where you can combine genome of each Dino to create superior Dino. For example certain part of Dino depend on how strong their genetic imprints are, will allow them to equipped cybernetics enhancement/weapon determine by ""slot"". Weak genome will have no slots but stronger genome can have up to 4 slots. And weapons can be installed based on how many slots available, with 4 slots equal to complete replacement of that part (e.g. replace the entire head). But that being said, some weaker genome Dino might have superior traits else where (e.g. giga chad skin texture) that you might want to combine with your more powerful Dino. The customisation is endless. The skins texture will involved Google AI to morph and combine the texture on the go so there is no ""present"" skins and you are free to make your own.There will be unique series that has very high details skins that you might want to combine with other (e.g. fossil, zombie or even alien skin...)
3. In phase 1 and 2 (possibly 3 as I have not yet fully planned this out), it will be all about character building or as you call it the first 2 hours of Skyrim. The next stage is to brings all of that into battle, PVE + PVP + GVG.

Let me know what you guys think and whether this is something that you might be interested in? Cheers.

We're an emergent DAO in formation inside the Catalyst DAO and an NFT bridge to others outside of Catalyst and Cardano at large. We aspire to:

* Holonic architecture
* Heterarchical communication
* Autonomous cooperative behavior
* Chaordic systems thinking

Our mission is to bring the Cardano NFT community together with the goal of delivering an open-source framework that allows anyone regardless of technical skill to deploy niche based NFT marketplaces. We can build better together.

Some of our progress thus far:

* Discord community of over 121 people
* Initial development, marketing, and governance Holons have formed.
* Branding and logo is in progress
* Initial marketing website live
* White paper in progress",m330c9,2021-03-11 22:51:27,NFT-DAO,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Addoption'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/m330c9/nft_dao_the_comprehensive_nft_framework_collab/,25,0,6,25,0,m330c9,post

It’s an acronym and my writing name. I am a military veteran that writes combat and love story fiction. But the pandemic turned me into a stay at home dad sooooo keeping my boys attention was the greatest military challenge I ever had. So I saw they loved anything with fighting, kungfu, farts and ridiculousness of every sort. So I came up with a story line but infused hyperlinks in PDFs that teach and deliver skits in accordance with Prek curriculum. 

The front is color coded 
Blue Line- ABCs (your kid touches the blue line inside the ebook which contained an embedded link that shows a skit or learning activity)

Orange Line- 123s (your kid touches the orange line inside the ebook which contained an embedded link that shows a skit or learning activity)

CardanoNFTs,Fully on-chain CNFT: the better NFTs? Hard to find though...,"I was just looking into these fancy fully on-chain NFTs. They seemed to have a [huge advantage](https://ruttkowa.medium.com/a-nft-stored-on-chain-what-fb890b6261ff) over normal NFTs: They can not disappear, just because an IPFS pinning service decides to drop its free tier. So I decided to dig deeper but found it quite hard to actually find these little gems. Seems to be a quite rare species...

help me to create a full list of all these wonderful #onchain cNFTs. please add anything you know of in the comments. Please share what kind of on-chain NFT it is (collectible/generative/animated/interactive/game)!

CardanoNFTs,"Artano, the NFT Art Marketplace that aims to bring equality, legality and opportunities to artists has applied for Fund5!!!","Hey folks,

This is an X-post from r/artano and r/cardano

I'm happy to announce the Fund5 proposal for Artano, the NFT Art Marketplace is out in the wild!

We're an international team of 8 experts who would not just create a place to mint and sell NFT's, but guide artists and collectors through the NFT world, including creating a legal framework, improving discoverability and creating the first user-driven platform.

There are many amazing projects in the NFT space, but we hope you choose Artano for its mission and thought-out approach (and give us a 👏 )

Here's the proposal link: [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Artano-The-NFT-Art-Marketplace/351682-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Artano-The-NFT-Art-Marketplace/351682-48088)",mpd3ws,2021-04-12 12:47:08,defi_authority,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mpd3ws/artano_the_nft_art_marketplace_that_aims_to_bring/,25,0,0,25,0,mpd3ws,post
CardanoNFTs,"Welcome to r/CardanoNFTs -- We showed up to the party, early!","# Wow, 70 subs in a day.

With native assets coming to the Cardano network, and the growing popularity of NFTs, I wanted us to have a community where we can share information and posts specifically about NFTs on the Cardano network.

**I truly believe NFTs are going to revolutionize the art community** (among other industries) **by giving some much-needed validity to digital art and assets** \-- and I believe Cardano will be the network to bring this technology to the masses.

# Current State of the Sub

It's safe to say we are all here to learn. I've seen a lot of questions being asked in the live chat and in posts, many of them are the same questions I have. Most haven't been answered yet, but this is to be expected, we've shown up to the Cardano NFT party pretty damn early. Because of this, I think our biggest priority right now is to organize our questions and answers into a pinned FAQ post. This can help us organize the info we already have and it can be a jumping-off point for people new to the community.

# How to Help

We need Q&amp;amp;amp;amp;As for our FAQ post. Most of us have questions, some of us have answers (hopefully), so if you'd like to help this community grow, visit [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/lm2l5d/have_a_question_about_cardano_nfts_leave_it_here/). If you have a question (anything relating to Cardano NFTs or NFTs in general) ask it. If you have an answer, answer it (and give references when necessary). If someone gave a Q/A that you were going to submit, up-boot it or maybe add to it.

If you have any good ideas for the subreddit, put them in a comment below.

If you come across any good articles or links relating to CardanoNFTs, post them on the sub.

# Mod(s)

Okay so hey, I'm u/TYLRwithspaces, I created this subreddit so I'm currently the only mod, but I'm looking for 1 or 2 more. My background is in the arts ^((There’s some cool projects on) [^(my website)](http://withspaces.online/) ^(if you're interested)) I have some knowledge of the technical side of things but not enough to answer questions or variety info continently so it would be nice to have a mod who was more familiar with that. Send me a message if you're interested.


**We all have different backgrounds and skills. We are all at different stages in our Crypto/Cardano/NFT journey. We all have different reasons why we're interested in NFTs on the Cardano network. We all can help each other learn along the way as we watch this technology grow from the ground up.**


TLDR:

Welcome to the r/CardanoNFTs. We're setting up a FAQ page for the sub. If you have any questions or think you could answer some, visit [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/lm2l5d/have_a_question_about_cardano_nfts_leave_it_here/). If you have any good ideas for the sub, comment them below.

Sounds interesting if they can pull it off. For me I prefer NFTs with utility (other then breed these two things together etc). I don't think anyone has nailed a game formula yet, but when they do I expect it to take off.

CardanoNFTs,,"Great question!

The platform will be supported by a governance token. We will have referendums, for example, where people can vote if they want to keep the council of artists? Do council members decide on new features on the platform and communicate with the Artano core team or does anyone who uses Artano choose via our token?

The number of invitations by each council member will be limited. The council will have up to 15 invites, and anyone can apply, where the bar to entry will be up to the community to decide. If they want meme-based art to be allowed, they can vote on it. If they want high-end art only, they can vote on that too. Initial council acts as an accelerator and a curation element to an extent. The council is also not permanent and people will be able to vote on its members (this is to be decided since we can run into logistical problems if we keep replacing the council members too often)

We are initially centralized and we'll open up to full decentralization as time passes, where we will make nearly no decisions, except for development/design decisions (which again over time, people can vote on).

Hope this makes sense and thank you for the question!",gx8vsv5,2021-05-07 06:43:47,artanoio,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/n6fl7m/you_asked_for_it_so_heres_some_behind_the_scenes/gx8vsv5/,3,0,,3,0,n6fl7m,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"parts of the solution will be open-source. Some business-critical information (specific API's to Artano) won't.

We'll strive to be as transparent as possible!

CardanoNFTs,Wasted Potential....,"Let me start by saying that I realize that this will likely be an unpopular post and, one which may even just get straight up removed. I realize that risk and also realize that it is doing this subreddit a disservice to continue sitting quietly.

At the time of this post, this subreddit has 14.4k members and 7 moderators. A quick review of their mod activity shows that only one, who also happens to be a mod on r/Cardano has had any recent activity relative to the space. A few haven't made post or comment on Reddit at all in nearly a year and one's ONLY contribution to the space has been shilling their own projects. To that end, I personally don't believe that ANY mod should be affiliated with ANY project, as an artist and certainly not as a minter. But, at this point, I would just be happy with Mods who showed up....

To be clear, NONE of this meant to be a personal attack on the Mods. I don't have anything against them. Modding is largely terrible thankless work so, I get it. BUT, we have become increasingly inundated with scam posts and generally waves of unmoderated project shilling on both Cardano AND Ethereum.

My point is, many of us I'm sure joined this space with the intention of learning, earning, and supporting the space with as much fervor and time as we can muster. It is clear to me that this space can, and SHOULD, be better. Where are the pinned posts and wikis providing information on wallet differences, types of mints/drops, confirmed upcoming project lists, etc. The community SHOULD have a place they can trust to provide this information clearly AND the community SHOULD have a place where people coming into the community are not seeing this subreddit as an example of the community involvement in the space because, frankly, it looks weak. Not everyone has the time or energy to juggle multiple Discords to figure all of this stuff out and, in the meantime, new blood coming in are going to get fed up with the barrier of entry. A barrier that this sub, which is dedicated to CardanoNFTs, SHOULD be focused on breaking.

Anyway, that is my rant. Thanks for listening.

TL;DR Nothing against the mods but the CNFT and larger Cardano community deserve better than the coasting along this subreddit has been doing.",sipzo0,2022-02-02 14:26:46,gafgarian,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/sipzo0/wasted_potential/,21,0,14,21,0,sipzo0,post

CardanoNFTs,,"We're a new & innovative Cardano project that's a monthly NFT series where the community votes on which Crypto Youtubers they want to see immortalized in hilarious limited edition Caricatures 😆  
Here's what makes us unique 👇  
1️⃣  Each month, any Cardano Caricature NFT holder gets to vote from 10 of their favorite Crypto Youtubers. The top two choices by the community get to become a limited edition NFT that drops later that month! 🙌  
2️⃣  Each Caricature has 15 different variations with hidden stamps and rarities all inspired by their Youtube content 📺  Your voting power each month is based on the rarity of all of your Cardano Caricature NFTs combined! 🗳  
3️⃣  If the 1,000 NFTs sell out for a Caricature, then all NFT holders get a fine art print of the exact NFT they received 🖼  This also unlocks 1,000 more unique art prints which can be purchased exclusively with ADA 👀

CardanoNFTs,,"While we don’t think there’s any one source you can look at to figure out if something is a scam, there are multiple factors you can judge. 

-How long has the project been around? (We were one of the first 10 creators in the space and have been preparing for this sale for over a month) 

-How large is the project? (We’re approaching 650 followers on Twitter)

-How easy is it to find information about the project( you can find all the relevant information about us on our website, including our policy ID and time lock policy. We also have channels in the Cardano NFT discord server and the CNFT discord server. You can also check out our sub Reddit)

-How much work has gone into the project and how much is invested in it? (We’ve been working on this first sale for over a month, we are a team of four and have poured a lot of time and energy into this project which we have very big aspirations for.)

-How long will the project be around? (We have our next 10 releases planned and many more after that which we are making concepts for. We plan to be around until the world freezes over.)

CardanoNFTs,Questions about minting NFTs ourselves once Goguen is released.,"I have a few questions about minting NFTs ourselves once Goguen is released, what the process will be like, and how can I prepare for it.

**A little background:** The reasons I'm asking is that (1) I'd like to have control over the parameters of my NFTs, (2) I'd like to release my NFTs on my own website, and (3) doing this will give me a better understanding of what exactly is going on behind the scenes. My background is in the arts and architecture, but I have a fair bit of experience writing python and I think I have an okay grasp of the basics and fundamentals of programming.

&#x200B;

1. (Let's get this one out of the way) Does it make sense for me to want to Mint my NFTs myself? Am I thinking about any of this the wrong way?
2. Would the benefits be worth the time and effort compared to using a marketplace?
3. To do this, would I have to set up an NFT platform or would I simply be putting my NFTs on the blockchain? (sorry for this question, I'm not sure how to word it)
4. What would the process be like? How difficult would it be? How long roughly would it take? A few hours? A few weeks?
5. How can I prepare for this? I'm assuming the main thing is to learn Plutus. Is there anything else?
6. Would my experience with Python help me at all? Are the fundamentals still the same or is it something completely different?
7. On a scale of 1-10 (C - Python), how intuitive is Plutus? How's the learning curve?
8. What are some good resources for this stuff?",mbinbo,2021-03-23 16:31:57,TYLRwithspaces,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mbinbo/questions_about_minting_nfts_ourselves_once/,21,0,1,21,0,mbinbo,post

CardanoNFTs,You can create/mint your NFTs at www.ez-mint.com for around 0.7 ADA,"Hello everyone! I've been searching for a service to mint my NFTs and discovered a couple of nice ones, but ultimately got thrown off by the fees they charge. This made me decide to take the time and implement my own service in order to save costs for myself and everyone else.

Check it out yourself and if you want to provide feedback, I'd be thrilled to hear about it.

Happy minting!

[www.ez-mint.com](https://www.ez-mint.com)  


**EDIT:** To clarify the costs of 0.7 ADA: Because someone asked and I want to be as transparent as I can be, here is an explanation. These are the effective total costs. The user will be asked to transfer around 2.3 ADA, but 1.6 ADA will be transferred back immediately together with the NFT. This is because of how the Cardano Blockchain works, which requires adding a minimum of \~1.6 ADA to a transaction containing an asset like an NFT. Hope this helps!

Edit: Addition: Are you looking to add aditional meta data options? So far I feel like the meta data on cardano NFTs are a bit lacking in comparison to minting one on polygon etc. Would love to have a nice cardano NFT Collection!  


Furthermore, since you've got the minting process down - why not set up a market place too? I'm currently using [Tokhun.io](https://Tokhun.io) but the layout/procedure isnt the best. Also tried CNFT but the verification process is impossible. Would be nice to get in on the ground up to launch a series of NFTs on an up and coming store.

CardanoNFTs,,"Can you detail your fee structure? 
How do you send the NFT back to the user with only .7 Ada? 
Min 1 Ada to send NFTs and they can only be minted at the node/relay wallet attached to your minting service. 
And then where are you storing the asset? 
IPFS? 
How can you afford to support your storage costs if you are only charging for transactions fees to mint the NFT.

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey and thanks for the kind confirmation and feedback!

As for your questions: 

I do plan to extend the creation process by giving an option for additional metadata. As far as I can see, this is a matter of allowing the user to add additional key/value fields. If it turns out that this would be of value for the users, I would definitely deploy an update asap.

For the marketplace feature: I totally agree with you. CNFT is hard to use currently. We have to keep in mind though that all those projects just started off and everyone has to learn the ins and outs of the Cardano Blockchain first. So far, I didn't make any research into how a marketplace could be realised technically. I'm on the lookout for more projects though, so this might be a good next candidate!

Hello Everyone! Was invited here to introduce myself. I'm the Creator of CryptoKnitties. Website is incoming, the timeline is on its way. Polls have started. I mostly use Twitter TBH, so keep in touch on there. Like a PNG, I enjoy transparency... Happy to answer any Qs. 

I am a Technical Artist and Academic exploring the NFT space. #CryptoKnitties is my way of doing that. I recently coded a toolset for some fellow artists producing work for the NFT space and this has led me to make these little squeezers!

When #cryptoknitties go on sale, there will be a charitable element. So, please keep things positive, supportive and uplifting!",mgp22v,2021-03-30 20:21:05,PlayMoveFun,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mgp22v/cryptoknitties/,21,0,9,21,1,mgp22v,post

CardanoNFTs,Building an NFT Marketplace? Do discoverability the right way...,"Long post but there's a ton of issues with crypto projects I want to address.

First I realise there's going to be a compulsion to just follow the heard, e.g. make another OpenSea or Rarible with Cardano themed colours. I would like to suggest to be more nuanced.

I'm a designer myself and in the crypto space I've seen countless bad user experiences. A lot of these issues revolve around poor discoverability, especially for starting users without an established audience.

First is categories, there need to be an intelligent and diverse hierarchy. The worst example I've seen is Haven marketplace app. The main cats are something like this:
- Woman's hats
- Mobile cellular devices
- Green golf clubs
- Red gold clubs

Basically it's a random mix of generic and detailed types of item the devs must have casually thought off on the spot and now users are stuck with it. Half the items I wanted to list don't have a relevant category whatsoever so they lost a seller. Do not do this, even OpenSea has a really poor choice of categories.

Unless your platform is very niche your categories need to cover all the potentialities, this includes areas of NFT currently unexplored. Use a platform like eBay for reference because they require many categories ranging from common household to rare collectables. Don't force people into using irrelevant cats unless you're willing to later overhaul (reorganise) all the listings.

Another issue is the YouTube model. This is already a problem with the current NFT marketplace, it's believed that onboarding a handful celebs and featuring them is good for the marketplace, just as YouTube tends to promote certain creators.

The issue here is that by doing so you bring a select few people into the loft and pull up the ladder. 

Sure you can advertise how celeb X made $$$ on your platform which might pull in some interest. However those new users are not going to sell anything, they will shop around for better options. It shouldn't be the case if you don't get featured on the homepage or a ciral tweet then the work is flooded in sea or never viewed NFTs. There are ways to solve this simply by how to you display and sort NFT.

I would like to encourage try to be innovative on the discoverability front. Make it so a user can actually find a very specific NFT using search or hashtags. Allow users to subscribe to specific topics and don't force feed them content they don't subscribe too, tailor the experience around the users specific interest(s). Some users might care about generic stuff but allow the others to only see NFT relating to #RetroRacing or #ChineseCalligraphy. 

Personally I would argue a good place to start is ditching the standard website style layout all the marketplace use. I can see far more efficient ways about making a marketplace more browsable for the average user / creator. 

Theres a lot more detail I could go into but for now I'll  end it here. Also if any Devs would like to collab let me know, I'm thinking about mocking up some ideas.

Fyi I'm building a video game with NFT in mind, I produce art in several mediums and I collect all sorts of rare antiques. I mention this because I have a lot of experience in niche communities most Devs probably don't know exist. I think / hope NFT will eventually branch into these spaces but only if devs are not shortsighted enough cripple their platform with unnecessary limitations.",m5ibbk,2021-03-15 11:08:10,NFTArtist,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Addoption'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/m5ibbk/building_an_nft_marketplace_do_discoverability/,21,0,2,21,0,m5ibbk,post

CardanoNFTs,,"Fully expecting the in game assets to do an easy 10x within the next 6-8 months as the initial gameplay starts to roll out and animations are integrated. Epic adventures and furniture will easily go for $1k each (to start with) considering the individual supply for each is so abysmally low and given their deflationary nature as adventurers die off while out on quests. The series 1 tiles will become *ridiculously* valuable as the game matures in the coming years.

Ive got like 40 pixel tiles, I'm irresponsibly bullish on this game.

I'd like to see the legendary Lars tiles hit $10k next year depending on what utility he ends up having. Dude is surrounded by shelves stuffed with potions and spell books and wearing a fucking modern microphone headset on his head... while existing within the middle of a high fantasy universe set in the distant past lol. Something's definitely up, and once we figure out what utility, bonuses and/or abilities he has, his slowly deflating supply of 600 will exit the upper atmosphere in spectacular fashion.

All I really want to know is: what the hell will the Mystic Orbs be used for?! They aren't furniture, they're the only tiles labeled as 'artifacts', and Lars is holding one as well (as well as a Lambda Shield Banner)",hkpz7nh,2021-11-15 14:14:52,lookslikeyoureSOL,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/qugpnj/imagine_owning_and_decorating_your_own_inn_where/hkpz7nh/,2,0,,2,0,qugpnj,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey Reddit community,

There is project myself and my team have been working on that we are immensely passionate about. 

We are releasing out first set of hand drawn Space Squids NFT due to arrive in the Cardano system early December 2021. We have a gargantuan year planned out for 2022, with the release of our first Space Squids graphic novel rollout begining in Q1 2022 and the release of our new game Squidverse due in Q4 2022 there’s certainly enough to keep the community busy. 

Our graphic novel will be sure to immerse you into our crazy world of sci-fi fiction without revealing any spoilers we are pretty sure you guys will be satisfied.

Squidverse will be a play to earn game spanning multiple galaxies where holders can battle each other using any tool in there arsenal from all Space Squid collections.

There are more than 10 different Squid Skins to collect, and over 100 accessories to bag. Every Squid will be a completely unique 1/1 piece.

We our very serious about giving back over here at Space Squids which is why 5% off all funds raised will be donated to a charity primarily focused on ocean cleansing and clean up, we believe we should set an example to all future generations and look after the place we call home. With future donations being chose by holders. Also we’re all about rewarding our own which is why all holder will have royalties from all sales split with them 50/50 just to show how much you guys mean to us and how much we value you guys.

If you are interested in NFT's, and in particular Cardano NFT's then we would love it if you guys checked us out, we are pretty sure you will not be disappointed.

CardanoNFTs,Lunars - The best CNFT community around,"Lunars - Best CNFT on Cardano

[Lunars CNFT - Best Community on Cardano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izWfJ-PcdUE)

Lunars is a project inspired by the Chinese zodiac and therefore is made up of the 12 animals from the famous emperor's race. The drop featured 6,666 unique Lunars, which sold out within a few hours. 

Apart from the smoothest drop imaginable, active devs, super clean designs, Lunars has the best, most friendly and engaged community I’ve ever been involved in. Currently floor price is rather low, but volume and average sell price are steady. Especially for a project that was dropped only a week ago. 

More importantly: the community is sprawling. The video above is made by one of our community members and, as I, am not paid to shill. Of course were invested in this - but not only because we own tokens, but also because we believe in this project very much. 

There’s a lot of stuff happening in the future (Lunars Race, Dark Lunars drop, merch and probably an airdrop around Chinese NY), so there is a lot to be exited about.

CardanoNFTs,NFT vs CNFT,"Hi all,
This week I did start with research about NFT and minting them.
I did watch a lot of YouTube videos and set up everything to buy my first NFT today.

I found the project omnimorphs.
By the time it was released I had to pay a gas fee of about 1000 euro😂.
Last couple of days I already found out that the gas price can be very high.

For example, want to buy a nft which cost 15 euros, had to pay 50 euros of fee.

Because of the high gas fee I am looking into CNFT. My first impression is that the marketplace and wallet system is not well organized like metamask and open sea.
However I want to try the CNFT market to make some profit.

Can you guys tell me the biggest difference between NFT market and CNFT?",ppm240,2021-09-16 21:02:42,hoppema0180,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ppm240/nft_vs_cnft/,20,0,20,20,0,ppm240,post
CardanoNFTs,,"https://pool.pm allows you to see and view your CNFT just simply enter your wallet address. 

As far as wallets there are more than several that you can use to store your CNFTs 

I Suggest the following since they work with a Ledger Hardware Wallet 

Ada Lite 
Yoroi Wallet Mobil/Web 
Daedalus

Biggest difference is it takes a few seconds to receive your CNFT, and cost for minting is well below 5 Dollars depends what platform you mint on. As well transaction fees are around .17 ADA

CardanoNFTs,,"Right now you can actually trade CNFTs and make good profit. Currently the main marketplace is [cnft.io](https://cnft.io) , it's still very new and needs lots of improvement, but as far as buying and selling go, it works. You can also safely trade and auction CNFTs via discord escrows, some trustable ones are [https://discord.gg/G8xPsEME](https://discord.gg/G8xPsEME) and [https://discord.gg/ZUdGAMyS](https://discord.gg/ZUdGAMyS) 

Or if you see something you like on the selling channels, you can ask the seller to list it on [cnft.io](https://cnft.io) and send you the link to the sale, just check the policy ID to ensure it's authentic. 

If you want to know upcoming CNFT drops, check out [wencnft.com](https://wencnft.com)

The beautiful thing about CNFTs is that you never worry about gas fees. People figured out lots of ways to trade them even before cardano smart contracts launched. Now with smart contracts live, the process will become a lot easier in the coming weeks and months.

Nami/Yoroi are pretty good wallets. Nami can even show the CNFTs as thumbnail but for now the buying/selling isn't optimal. You can use Discord severs for buying/selling. Most big projects have an escrow service which is sort of a sale thru a middleman to not get scammed.

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi! Marcus from [nftdevelopments.io](https://nftdevelopments.io) here.

This NFT collection series is our collaboration with Joshua Miller from Crypto Supreme for the Goguen Commemorative Coin.

Our team spent 5 months full-time to create the whole collection that includes the oil painting (that was used as the base), the animation and the original orchestral music that is coming with the collection.

The link to the coins are here: [https://cryptosupreme.net/search?type=product&q=goguen](https://cryptosupreme.net/search?type=product&q=goguen)

The NFT will be airdropped to your Yoroi wallet address (since when the project started we used Yoroi and there wasn't Nami) so make sure to paste the address when you purchase the coin.

The process of production can be found at [https://www.nftdevelopments.io/cardano-goguen-nft](https://www.nftdevelopments.io/cardano-goguen-nft)

We are looking to add a VR immersive (and possibly interactive) experience on the NFT post-drop as well as expanding the universe by collaborating with more artist is more ""traditional"" disciplines like sculptors and dancers for an immersive show ""Neo-Renaissance"" universe.",hc2xyi4,2021-09-08 17:20:08,MarcusZena,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pket5j/goguen_nft_with_goguen_commemorative_coin_crypto/hc2xyi4/,6,0,,6,0,pket5j,comment

CardanoNFTs,Free NFT,"*UPDATE: My goal was to use this as a way to learn the minting process and share art with the Cardano community. I set out to mint 5-10 NFTs. I ended up minting 10 and learned a ton. There was more interest than I anticipated, so I will be doing these ""seedshares"" more in the future. Thanks for your interest and kind words. Be on the lookout for the next seedshare.* 

I minted my first NFT on the Cardano network the other day. [https://pool.pm/f455d6c0f8c759accc1968e07573c2bee8296b5caff5bcfa40fcb00f.seed0150](https://pool.pm/f455d6c0f8c759accc1968e07573c2bee8296b5caff5bcfa40fcb00f.seed0150)

I will be doing some minting over the next couple days and I would like to share with anyone who is interested in my work. You can take a look here: [https://www.instagram.com/splatterat/](https://www.instagram.com/splatterat/) If you are interested, reply to this thread or DM me your address and I will mint directly to your wallet.  I will give away 5-10.",pihv1b,2021-09-05 17:57:56,splatterat,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pihv1b/free_nft/,22,0,75,22,1,pihv1b,post

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi u/Huth_S0lo,

Compared to other minting services on the market at the moment, we are offering the first   minting service powered by smart contract on Cardano. It's fully decentralized, user no needs to send ADA to a centralized wallet to be able to mint their NFT. Moreover, at Cardahub, we are giving user two minting options: free minting and premium minting. For Free minting, user only needs to pay for the transaction fee and all NFTs will be long to the same collection named Cardahub collection. For Premium minting, user only needs to pay 1 ADA more to be able to mint NFT with their own customized collection.

Feel free to try it out at our website: [https://cardahub.io](https://cardahub.io)

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi captainray5,  


Thanks for your interest in our service.  
Currently we have two minting options: 

\- Free minting which is free of charge for everyone. You can mint any NFT you like and pay only the default network transaction fee.

\- Premium minting which we charge 1ADA for each NFT at the moment. We believe this is the cheapest fee in the market at the moment. However, if you are willing to mint many collections with us, please contact us via [contact@cardahub.io](mailto:contact@cardahub.io) or any of our social media channels for further discussion.  
Thanks

In one week, this has gone from nothing to over saturated. Finally, to be clear, the chain is NOT the cause for this backlog.

CardanoNFTs,Experiment of minting noticeable amount of tockens with a single transaction. BLOCKNOTES Asset on Cardano network.,"Continue my experiments with Native tokens, I've tried to mint a noticeable amount of tockens with a single transaction.

I've decided to mint a kind of banknotes of nominal from 1 to 5K and called them BLOCKNOTES. They have the following ASCII values and quantity of the tokens:

&#x200B;

|name/nominal|quantity|total value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|5000BLOCKNOTE|20|100,000|
|2000BLOCKNOTE|50|100,000|
|1000BLOCKNOTE|100|100,000|
|500BLOCKNOTE|200|100,000|
|200BLOCKNOTE|500|100,000|
|100BLOCKNOTE|1000|100,000|
|50BLOCKNOTE|2000|100,000|
|10BLOCKNOTE|10000|100,000|
|5BLOCKNOTE|20000|100,000|
|1BLOCKNOTE|100000|100,000|

So I've minted 133870 Tokens of 10 Assets with a single minting and fee about 0.2USD (I used cardano-cli). This was pretty straight-forward.

I've used the single metadata.json with 10 id's and corresponding image in IPFS:

I've used example images of Russian Rubles banknotes from the site of Russian Central Bank.

I've sucessfully sent the custom amount of several BLOCKNOTE tokens with Daedalus wallet to the friends of mine within single transaction, and got some back from them. The tokens of the same asset are being stacked correctly.

~~""BLOCKNOTES"" have no real value or the same value as chewing gum sticker :) If you like to have any NFT in your Wallet and have no any yet, let me know, I will send you some BLOCKNOTES for free. And you can distribute them as you like. It's kinda fun.~~

**UP. Later on I composed marketing information for BLOCKNOTES.** I'm appending it below in a quote block:

>BLOCKNOTES was copied from Russian Rubles, and I minted only 1 million of BLOCKNOTEs total nominal. I provided them with the One Million Russian Rubles deposited in the Moscow Bank ""СБЕРБАНК"". So you can send it back to me anytime you want and get equivalent value in Russian Rubles per bank transfer or ADA according to international exchange rate on the current date. It's also possible to exchange them to physical Russian Cash items which I can send by the post for collectioning purposes (but we should negotiate shipping costs beforehand).1000 Russian Rubles are, roughly speaking is 10ADA at the moment of publication. So I'm selling 1000 BLOCKNOTEs for 10ADA at the moment, you could choose the nominals, but by default I propose 1x500, 1x200, 1x100, 1x50, 5x10, 10x5 and 50x1. To have all the collection you need only to add 1000BLOCKNOTE, 2000BLOCKNOTE, and 5000BLOCKNOTE.  
>  
>I sell 1000BLOCKNOTE for 10ADA, 2000BLOCKNOTE for 20ADA and 5000BLOCKNOTE for 50 ADA.  
>  
>Total value of 1 million Russian Rubles is currently about 10000 ADA. Since Russian Rubble is suspect of emission and gets cheaper but ADA gets more value a day to day it's not profitable to invest in Rubles but as there never be more BLOCKNOTES it's ok to invest in them as they are:

1. Original
2. Limited - only 20 of 5000BLOCKNOTEs available)
3. Fun
4. Collectilbe

>*...and the last, we already starting to forget how cash and banknotes looks like, soon there will not be any, and those BLOCKNOTEs will be everlasting memory.*

Before I finish with the BLOCKNOTEs let me show you how nice they looks in the wallet:

# ATHOM

I've compleated the research and find the **Maximum Amount of the same Cardano Native tockens which can be issued**:

Long story short, it's **A bit more than Nine Quintillions**

nine quintillion two hundred twenty three quadrillion three hundred seventy two trillion thirty six billion eight hundred fifty four million seven hundred seventy five thousand eight hundred and seven to be exact. Or just **9,223,372,036,854,775,807**

Explanation:

When I've tried to mint really huge amount of tockens with cardano-cli, i've got meaningful error message:

>unexpected "" ""  
>  
>expecting quantity (word64)  
>  
>expecting word64, but the number exceeds the max bound: MyHugeNumber

word64 can carry 2\^64 in Decimal, which is 18446744073709551616, so I've tried to issue this amount of tokens and got:

>unexpected "" ""  
>  
>expecting quantity (word64)  
>  
>expecting word64, but the number exceeds the max bound: 18446744073709551616

but 18446744073709551615 was just fine. It's expected - 2\^64 is the overflow and 2\^64 - 1is just fine.

But when trying to sign this transaction i've got the following:

>Command failed: transaction sign  Error: matx.raw: TextEnvelope decode error: DecoderErrorDeserialiseFailure ""Shelley TxBody"" (DeserialiseFailure 209 ""overflow when decoding mint field. min value: -9223372036854775808 max value: 9223372036854775807 got: 18446744073709551615"")

I've repeated the steps with the **9,223,372,036,854,775,807** tokens to mint and succesfully sign and submit the transaction with the regular fee on 0.2 USD.

It was anticipated, but needs to be highlighted:

**Minting fee does not depend on the number of tockens being minted.**

I've minted **9,223,372,036,854,775,807** tokens which I've called **ATHOM**s. In appreciation of **Democritus** **atomic** theory of the universe and a British name **ATHOM** which means ""Success comes easily to you"" :D To the date **ATHOM**s are the most *numerous* Native Tockens at Cardano Blockchain. So if you want to have some ATHOMS for free, than just DM me too.

I've found a bug in Daedalus. For some reason I can't sent something like a quentillion of ATHOMs with it.

I was able to sent just 23,372,036,854,775,810 ATHOMs to u/MEME-Pool who showed interest. The amount is 100s time less then the total ATHOMs count. And I see no reason it shouldn't be possible.

I've found two more bugs now in Yoroi Wallet for iOS.1st. Token Number goes out of screen.

I unable to sent any amount of ATHOMs to anyone, even 1 ATHOM. Yoroi is just hangs when I hit confirm button :D

**Later on I composed a marketing information and put it below in a quote block:**

>There is no image for ATHOM token, because you cant't see an atom with your own eyes :D  
>  
>There is nothing more than ATHOMs at Cardano Blockchain  
>  
>I sell a Quadrillion of ATHOM's for 10ADA  
>  
>It's fun to have a Quadrillion of whatever in your wallet  
>  
>I exchange BLOCKNOTEs with ATHOMs: 1 BLOCKNOTE is 1 Trillion ATHOMs.

# Plans:

I'm going to do the smartcontracts when they will be available to allow people exchange BLOCKNOTEs per nominal (as cash) and exchange BLOCKNOTEs with ATHOMs.Today I keep the exchange rate of 10 ADA for Quadrillion of ATHOMs and 10ADA per Thousand of BLOCKNOTES so 1 BLOCKNOTE is 1 Trillion ATHOMs. Probably it will be the constant in future smart contracts I plan. If one of those two will be getting more value it will pump the other.This is sick but it's fun :DI ready to provide conversion manually till the smartcontracts :DD

Disclaimer: 

1. I've edited initial post to keep it up-to-date instead of posting new.
2. I've added images to be fancy, since I've realised how it can be done on Reddit.

CardanoNFTs,,"I've sent you:

1, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 BLOCKNOTES - 1000 BLOCKNOTES in total

(I've seen you already have 5BLOCKNOTE, seems I've send you earlier together with the ATHOMs to please you more :)

BLOCKNOTES copied from Russian Rubles, and I issued only 1 million of BLOCKNOTEs total nominal which I provided with the 1 million Russian Rubles I really have. So you can send it back to me anytime you want and get equivalent value in Russian Rubles per bank transfer or ADA per international exchange rate. It's also possible to change them to physical Russian Cash which I can send by the mail for collectioning purposes (but it should be negotiated about shipping cost).1000 Rubles are roughly speaking is 10ADA. So **you could send me 10 ADA.**

Total value of 1 million Russian Rubles is currently about 10000 ADA. Since Russian Rubble is suspect of emission and gets cheaper and ADA gets more value a day to day it's not profitable to invest in Rubles but as there never be more BLOCKNOTES it's good to invest in them as they are:

1 BLOCKNOTE is 1 Trillion ATHOMs. Probably it will be the constant in future smart contracts I plan and if one of them will got more value it will pull the other up.

CardanoNFTs,,"Hello! Fellow CNFT buyer here. Yoroi should be just fine to buy your CNFTs with. They don't currently have an area to view them in the wallet, but you can look up your receiving address here to see them: pool.pm

The biggest problem currently is that the bigger projects that are minting are slowing down some of the wallets including Yoroi and Nami. So, it is preferred to use the Daedalus wallet if minting (can only be downloaded on PC). However, for the most part, Yoroi should be just fine and it is what I use currently. Though will be switching to Daedalus soon.

There are many more killer projects and many more to be minted. This is just a few. This stuff is just getting started. Glad you could join in the fun!! 

The best way I have found to find new projects is to use a combination of the CNFT Calender website listed above and Twitter. Twitter is your best friend!!

CardanoNFTs,,"To answer the initial question - it doesn’t matter which wallet you use, every address which is able to handle Ada can also handle / hold tokens. That’s why they are called „native“ assets.

The question you really should be asking is:

„What’s the best service / app / wallet to view my NFTs / native assets?“

As many others wrote, querying your address in pool.pm is the de facto standard way.
You can also use the Nami wallet which is a browser plug-in and supports a little gallery of your NFTs.

What this does not cover is the question of interaction.
Sending one to multiple token, including Ada to one or more addresses is currently something not really implemented. Also I’ve heard of problems if the wallet holds too many tokens.
Which isn’t a problem in itself but wallets like Yoroi try to cram everything into one transaction and therefore exceeding the size limit of a transaction. 

Long story short - this is how the utxo model works and wallets should cater to those concepts in splitting up transactions under the hood - which I am not sure of if that’s already available.",hevfr60,2021-09-30 17:18:01,rootkowa,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pybf01/i_am_thinking_about_buying_a_nft_i_havent_done_it/hevfr60/,2,0,,2,0,pybf01,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"How are bigger projects slowing down the wallets ? Maybe this should be clarified- the only thing bigger projects are slowing down is the overall network. Especially if multiple drops happen at the same time.
More drops = more transactions = more information to process for light wallets like Yoroi or Nami. 
Also to clarify - you can not mint with Daedalus. But a full node is the safest way to make sure that your transaction gets processed when a drop is happening.

If you, for example, use Yoroi, the transaction needs to be sent to the Yoroi servers, processed and then a full node sends the transaction to the network to be included in the next block.

With a full node like Daedalus you can send the transaction directly to the network for it to be included in the next block.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

All wallets are based off of a seed phrase. You can generate this phrase with Daedalus or Yoroi. And you can restore a wallet, created with a seed phrase on Yoroi in Daedalus or vice versa.
There’s no linking whatsoever possible. It’s just a different approach / way of communicating with the network.

CardanoNFTs,,"Yes, it would be locked up, but you could cancel the trade at any time by sending 2 ADA from the same wallet you used to create it. To be precise, for a fixed-price sale, you can cancel at any time and for the auction based ones, this is possible only until there are no bids.

The platform is currently centralized, so no smart contracts yet. However, we have a proposal in Fund6 which is meant to secure the funds to partially cover the costs of converting the heart of the app to smart contracts and speed up further development. Also, the upside of having a centralized platform at the moment is that, in case of any issues, we have means of rectifying any potential problems and making sure that are business logic is bullet proof once going decentralized.",hdy5280,2021-09-23 10:29:37,el-gato-loco,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ptd109/cardano_blue_worlds_first_nft_marketplace_and/hdy5280/,1,0,,1,0,ptd109,comment

Not sure if anyone has seen these yet but here it goes.

Brand new NFT on the [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io) marketplace minted on September 13th with only 2100 in existence.

It's the very first Cardano NFT Collection with royalties and it has an interesting roadmap. The ability to breed Cardoggos of different rarities to mint new and possibly even more rare NFTs is in the development pipeline, along with being able to post up your Cardoggos to breed for a price as well. Basically pimping your NFT for literal profit which I found pretty interesting.

The floor moved from 20 ADA to 400 in just 5 days.

Currently a giveaway is being held for a Cardoggo on twitter:  [https://twitter.com/deep\_permit/status/1439505445358608384?s=20](https://twitter.com/deep_permit/status/1439505445358608384?s=20)

And I have the Cardoggos NFT discord here: [https://discord.gg/6skE57P9](https://discord.gg/6skE57P9)

In a pretty short time I've become a huge NFT enthusiast like I'm sure a lot of you guys are too. So many cool projects and it's so early in the space especially with Cardano. This is one of the cooler one's in my opinion so I figured I'd let the word out.

Good luck guys! We all deserve it after this last year.

CardanoNFTs,NFTs on Cardano,"Hi guys,
I am a big supporter of Cardano, i believe it can change the financial system around the world!
I am doing research on how to build a NFT Marketplace on Cardano.
I am currently looking for developers, who can help me build the product! We currently received some funding and are looking for developers, who can help us build the platform. 

Which program languages are need to build and NFT Marketplace on Cardano? Plutus and Haskell?

Any information or contacts would be highly appreciated!
Thanks,
Philipp",nley9l,2021-05-26 11:44:05,pkalltheway_,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Developer'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/nley9l/nfts_on_cardano/,17,0,15,17,0,nley9l,post
CardanoNFTs,,"Try asking in r/CardanoDevelopers if you haven't.

Also, there is an area in the Plutus Pioneers Discord for posting job listings. That would be the best way to find the people learning this new contract process. Lars and mods might be the gatekeepers for listing jobs there, but I'm not sure. Maybe you can just join and list it.

&#x200B;

Here is some general info about learning to program contracts for anyone looking to jump onboard:

The most user friendly thing would be the online plutus playground:  
https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/  
Just be sure to click ""hello world"" at the top of the page to remove all the scary code and start somewhere easier. Then push the compile and simulate button to run the example.  
  
Right now Haskell is a must IMO. I'm learning it here:  
http://learnyouahaskell.com/  
  
To get more specific to Cardano contracts (coming soon), the Plutus Pioneer Program is here:  
https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program  
  
If you need help setting up a Plutus on Windows WSL, I made a video about it: https://youtu.be/mnfItts6VbU  
I plan to continue the series on Haskell and Plutus starting next week.  
Hope this helps!",gzifk0u,2021-05-26 13:32:56,JBarCode,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/nley9l/nfts_on_cardano/gzifk0u/,4,0,,4,0,nley9l,comment

CardanoNFTs,"We just deployed a live smart-contract ""token giveaway machine"" and it's working like a charm","[The Token of St Jude](https://cyphermonks.com/the-token-of-st-jude), aka JUDE token, was recently minted and policy-locked and details will follow regarding function, or FUNctions as we call them. And we were planning a small giveaway for our early community members and auction participants...and we wanted to use a smart contract (I'm the techy one of the two of us at CypherMonks, so I've been toying with smartcontracts and such since our launch around Sep 12).

The challenge was making it accessible for everyone...EASILY. So I created an application I'm calling CardanoBridge, which bridges that gap.

The smart contract is now live and integrated with CardanoBridge and working perfect! Here's the mainnet address to view the smartcontract and see the JUDE coins locked inside: [https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wxc09z3xzk4ahgulujelty53we4km7qctsymht9a3zsxzuqzt9gsl](https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wxc09z3xzk4ahgulujelty53we4km7qctsymht9a3zsxzuqzt9gsl)

So here's how it works: our early members provide an ADA address that is added to a whitelist. Once on the list, they send 1.5 ADA to a unique CardanoBridge address and within minutes the Smart Contract is engaged by CardanoBridge, performing all the transactions and special criteria necessary in sending that person 290 JUDE tokens along with their 1.5 ADA back, and a little extra (0.2) to cover fees, so it's free.

The smart contract can of course be interacted with by anyone anywhere, but it has two conditions which must be met to spend any amount of the locked JUDE tokens. Our bridge application meets those conditions and so it can spend some to the recipient and return the change to the smart contract!

If someone figured out what those conditions are, they would have to forfeit some funds to empty the smart contract, making it an unfruitful endeaver as JUDE tokens do not hold any monetary value that we know of :)

This Bridge application and smart contract are just a simple beginning for us. We are really excited about what we have in the works as we continue to build and grow.

I am not familiar with the Cards project, so I can't speak to it either way, but Naru as a brand was beloved before they started the CNFT series which I think is something of a benefit, and as a bonus, Yummi's team are really nice people.

Also, Dan might go on to accomplish some fantastic things within the Cardano ecosystem.

It is things like this that make items scarce in the future--NFTs with an incredible history from the early days!

CardanoNFTs,,"Is he giving the ada back to everyone who purchased or just those who minted? 
He is only giving ada back to those who minted so the sec doesn't look into him over the way he pushed the nft.

Did Dan say a few days in a video that coco had a future? Was there a few sentences on the website about there being future drops? 

Dan is a snake oil sales man.

He owns four pools, which is bad for Cardano decentralization and those four pools only benefit him. The only thing Dan cares for in the Cardano ecosystem is to make himself rich.

\- Extending of my Twitter and Instagram community (I dont have discord yet)  
\- If there were supporters / buyers, I would continue in minting.  
\- My collection is full of animals, therefore I would like to support some rescue centers or dog shelters etc from my profit (about 20%).

CardanoNFTs,"The First ""Bitcoin Pizza Incident"" On Cardano","The Hoskinsons is a cNFT project made by [the\_hoskinsons](https://twitter.com/the_hoskinsons) on Twitter, whose 10,000 NFT presale sold out in one hour. In [The Hoskinsons Discord server](https://discord.gg/Z9tmwWPD), we started a ""Bitcoin Pizza Incident"" whereby pizza was bought with ""hosk coins"", the fungible token of The Hoskinsons cNFT series.

**Jub#4134 decided to give away a free pizza on the Discord server, paying in hosk coins. GraphWoodpecker#7969, from Singapore, was in the mood for pizza. Seamoss#9183, from California, ordered that pizza delivery at no cost to Graph. Then, Jub reimbursed Seamoss for the pizza in hosk coins, at 100 hosks per US dollar.**

Graph then [Tweeted a picture of the pizza](https://twitter.com/MarcusAiden/status/1423536680892465153), it was a double (Canadian Pizza company forces you to buy pizzas in pairs!). The receipt for that pizza was [minted as a cNFT](https://pool.pm/059c09197126afac8ca06dc49f57bf522f2b54315a8ba59ab30ee78f.HoskPizzaIncident), only 3 in existence under PolicyID 059c09197126afac8ca06dc49f57bf522f2b54315a8ba59ab30ee78f, and given to all parties involved.

Up until now, all the NFTs on Cardano have been a bit of metadata that points to an IPFS image. What unsigned_algorithms is doing is actually minting code which generates art onto the blockchain.

We're the first on-chain code generated NFT project on Cardano. We mint the code to generate the NFTs directly into the NFT, so regardless of what happens to IPFS, as long as Cardano is live you will be able to generate your NFTs.

CardanoNFTs,PASSIVE INCOME WITH #CUTEMON BY NIGHT PARADE OF 100 DEMONS #CNFT #NFT," Sooooo since the launch of the #cutemon collection by NP 100 Demons, as a massive fan I have managed to collect 106 cutemons, minted and purchased from the secondary market.

I am (and have been) rewarded 105 ada for every month I hold them in my verified wallet.

Now that is what I call the definition of PASSIVE INCOME with C/NFTs.

CardanoNFTs,"Yes, you can DIY launch a fully-automated and fully-self-owned NFT drop campaign of any scale, now live on Testnet in our dApp Minted :: Basically an NFT vending machine or ""engine"", where you own the whole vehicle, the whole process, and can be configured in minutes (+ a hugely helpful community!)","Minted alpha (by MintedWithLovelace) is our dApp, out now, which is a truly decentralized NFT launchpad (with nft-dex coming soon) that features mint-on-demand, mint-at-buyer's address, advanced whitelisting, auto refunds where applicable, automated campaign ending, and a ton more features.

I'm particularly interested in getting Alpha into the hands of creators who want to really own their launch and explore some of the cool things this dApp can already do, with a lot more features in the works right now, pegged to be released in the final alpha versions this month....including blacklisting/whale mitigation, transaction grouping (aka concurrency), and auctions!

We're a really active community and where I am absent or busy, lots of smart and skilled community members also pop in to answer questions, provide advice and guidance overall.

Our goal overall is to create an easy to use, totally decentralized and wholly owned (both your launch project via using the self-sovereign dApp...and the MintedWithLovelace community project, owned by the community), and ultimately empower artists and creators, who have sort of become the ""workforce"" behind this mamoth movement, which then tends to favours the investor over the artist. Building this dApp and our community, to tackle this issue leveraging Cardano tech, is just the beginning!

CardanoNFTs,,"Not trying to beat a dead horse, but CryptoDoggies minted the first of their Hippie Doggies on September 8th.  And it has the 777 token.

And this wasnt the first project to add royalties.  They started being use the day the 777 standard was announced.  If you want to see the worlds very first 777 token, you can see it here:

CardanoNFTs,,"Thanks for the information. Per the discord:

>The first person that mints each Cardoggo will get 5% lifetime royalties every time that Cardoggo is sold based on CIP-0027 standard.  
>  
>Several key members of Cardano convened on Saturday, August 28th 2021 to iron out a community standard CIP-0027 (777) for the implementation of royalties which can be used immediately allowing for the original minter to receive a lifetime commission on sales. you can check out the proposal attached

So yeah it looks like the CIP-0027  is what they were after. After reading the GH PR here: [https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/116/files](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/116/files) I agree that this does not seem to follow the standard.

CardanoNFTs,,"Yeah this is a really odd one.  ""The first person that mints each Cardoggo will get a 5% lifetime royalties...""  


Well that would mean that they would have to track whoever made the purchase; which they could theoretically do.  But who's going to pay the 5% royalty?  If they didnt follow the 777 standard, then they wont be getting a royalty at all for the tokens.  But furthermore, the 777 standard only allows the specifying of one wallet. So not sure how they expected this to end up at the original purchasers wallet.  


At first I thought maybe they just didnt understand how to add royalties, and goofed.  Now I just think they were trying to pull a fast one.",hdymkeg,2021-09-23 13:28:01,Huth_S0lo,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ptle19/if_you_love_dogs_you_will_love_cardoggo/hdymkeg/,1,0,,1,0,ptle19,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"It looks like the original proposal might have been that the metadata would be embedded in each asset, but was decided upon to only be a single token that would optionally be burned with a single address.

CardanoNFTs,"unsigned algorithms - programmatic fine art just passed the 10,000 bought mark","Cool aspects of this project...

* The project actually mints code that then generates art on the blockchain. So the art lives forever  and can always be generated. No IPFS image issues.
* [The total supply of these is 31,119](https://www.unsigs.com/). The first 10,000 cost 50 ADA for 3 unsigs. Now, the next 10,000 cost 50 ADA for 2 unsigs. The last 10,000 will cost 50 ADA for 1 unsig.
* The creators of unsig won't sell the next version of these. Instead, they'll drop that collection directly into the wallets of the collectors. And collectors can release them however they want.
* Collectors are taking their 1st gen unsigs, combining different pieces to create brand new pieces and minting something entirely new. All of this is approved and welcome by the creators.

It's unlike any NFT project I've ever encountered, and I hope the CNFT community gets better acquainted with it. ✌️❤️🎨

CardanoNFTs,Let's Build A Well w/ 100% ADA!!,"Hey guys, I started an artist collective called The Rokindo Collective for my friends and I about 2 months ago now and it has grown into something I never even thought was possible. So for the sake of Reddit, I will spare you guys any shilling about their NFTs and will just route you to our Discord and Website:

Discord: [https://discord.gg/Hbqf4QeDPh](https://discord.gg/Hbqf4QeDPh)

Website: [https://the-rokindo-collective.squarespace.com/](https://the-rokindo-collective.squarespace.com/)

With that being said, I want to share with you guys something that we’ve been working on for quite some time now since starting this project. I have always planned to do something that would benefit the world using this platform. Seeing as Cardano and its philosophy is to restructure the entire financial and government systems of the world, I not only want to do “good”, but I want to do “tangible good”. I see myself as a utilitarian/pragmatic thinker so finding a charity that would use donations for something “tangible” that can help communities around the world is key. I also think it would be super cool for a charity to accept donations 100% in ADA! I think it would be amazing if we as a community could come together and help the world and show the power that the Cardano community has as a whole.

Helping communities is something that I am extremely passionate about. I grew up in America with many “luxuries” but have been fortunate to experience the world from a different perspective from a very young age. I visit my father’s family in Palawan, Philippines, a place with limited resources though extremely beautiful. At the time, I was 6yrs old and I was immediately perplexed to see and experience how my family lived. Even though my family lives such a simple life, they are some of the kindest, humble, unselfish, and happy people I have ever met. And even though the quality of life has improved in many parts of the Philippines since I have been (I am 23 now), it has still made a lasting impression on me.

However, this is the case in many developing countries around the world. SO! We are teaming up with u/*21ADA* and his wife u/thinkgrowcrypto and their stake pool to help fund and create a freshwater well in Ethiopia, a place where there is massive poverty and civil unrest. I believe that delivering this “tangible good” is one of the single most practical ways we as a community can come together and change the world 1 community at a time. At first, this started as a simple u/JosephMiranda commission to redesign their website, but the more we talked and found out more about their mission-driven stake pool, the more we became interested in helping drive their mission in funding the construction of a water well in Ethiopia.

On Wednesday, June 23, we will be auctioning off some of Joseph Miranda’s 1/1 unique commission pieces he created for 21ADA through our Discord server. 30% of the auction will go directly towards funding the freshwater well in Ethiopia. As of writing this, their fund is at 634.63 ADA. To fully fund a well, it is $10,000 which is about 10,000 / 1.50 = 6666 ADA. I think with everyone’s help this is very possible! This could be the very first charity that would be 100% funded in ADA.

And to ensure complete transparency of the donation, we will be coming up with a **Proof of Donation** system that will be recorded directly on the blockchain.

u/*21ADA* and u/thinkgrowcrypto have been so authentic and have been such a pleasure to work with. They are so honest and sweet. I encourage everyone to delegate some of your ADA to their stake pool! With your delegation, you simply vote for 21ADA’s pool to help give it a more active participation in the support of the decentralization of the Cardano network, actively minting new blocks. Delegation for you will turn into a pleasant income because the Cardano network will automatically generate “rewards” every 5 days for participating in delegating and 21% of their own rewards will be donated to funding the water well. 21ADA Stakepool also offers free NFT rewards for those who delegate to their pool!

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi all! I just wanted to let the community know that AdaCards now has a dedicated Discord server for all things AdaCards.

As well, the team behind the cards have minted all the available packs and are posted for sale on the website here: [AdaCards Shop](https://cards.adafolio.com/reservecards)

Another little tidbit, a community member that goes by Goldboys has created a Google Doc to help search for rarity of cards. The team is also in the process of implementing a similar feature to the website. If you want to take a look at the Google Doc here it is: [Rarity Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qllt5rrVM0bes_U_8WrIv0WtjgVAitMME46xN7T4QlU/edit?usp=drivesdk)

CardanoNFTs,,"Hello Everyone, I am new to your group of very thoughtful and creative ADA developers and supporters. I am reaching out to our community to ask if anyone could help me to find a way to mint nfts on Cardano? I saw [nft-marker.io](https://nft-marker.io) Web site, which is impressive and helpful, and built by 2 students. However, I have an 85 MB .MP4 that I would like to mint 10,000 times, and that would be the hard capped supply. 

Best of luck to ADACards Shop, I wish you the best with your endeavor. This type of creative work will help to elevate the Cardano blockchain, and the work of Charles Hoskinson. 

Thank you very much. I greatly appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to becoming more and more engaged in our community.

CardanoNFTs,Introducing the Novellia Gaming Platform and Store,"&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/m6b4jx/video/erdazml1oen61/player

**Welcome to gaming 3.0!**

You used to own your stuff, but then the internet came along. It's time to take back custody.

The Novellia Platform is a decentralized game marketplace built on blockchain technology. It reduces fees for everyone and prevents censorship from centralized gate keepers. Take back ownership of your hard earned digital content in the form of NFT game assets and licenses: never worry about your account being banned again.

This is to be realized through two components:

* Novellia Dashboard
* Novellia Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

The Novellia Dashboard is a single point of access for gaming needs as they relate to Cardano.

**Interoperability**

NFT artwork is a gimmick, but game assets and licenses make a ton of sense, especially with a strong ecosystem. The dashboard makes it easy to find and play games that utilize Cardano, including their associated tokens and NFTs. By keeping everything together, interoperable NFTs make a lot more sense.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could see at a glance what that shiny sword NFT is supported on? What if you wanted to try it before you bought it? In one game that sword can be a weapon. In another, it might access a super secret store. Or maybe it unlocks a spiky car in a racing game?

Indie developers can use this mechanic to bootstrap their player base, utilizing tokens released for similar titles.

**Security**

Gamers don't want to spend hours verifying checksums and PGP signatures when they download blockchain integrated games. It needs to be easier than that. The Novellia Dashboard only lists content secured democratically through the Novellia DAO. No more copycat tokens or fake smart contracts: if it isn't whitelisted, it's safely hidden.

Install content directly through the dashboard!

**Quality**

Sick of scouring through low quality content? The Novellia DAO uses a governance token so gamers can democratize what quality means. Whether that means disbursing funds to community content makers, listing the next best game, or blocking a buggy update from a greedy game developer.

**Incentives**

Best of all, holders of Novellia (NVLA) are paid to vote! Why else would they?

**Check it out!**

CardanoNFTs,,As long as the games are proprietary you are still locked in into a centralized system by the game creator. But NFTs would be an awesome way to monetize open source games.,gr5dsv8,2021-03-16 18:16:18,Cherubin0,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/m6b4jx/introducing_the_novellia_gaming_platform_and_store/gr5dsv8/,1,0,,1,0,m6b4jx,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"That's entirely correct, game developers are still in control of their games.

One of the restrictions of the decentralized marketplace, however, is that there is no centralized database. To get around this, the standard for game ownership will be the use of license NFTs. Whether these are rentals with an expiry time, a token with account metadata, or something similar.

Naturally, game developers could implement their games as ""free"" and then implement some kind of login barrier after the game is launched from the dashboard. Or they could implement their own auth methods. This may be contrary to community goals, however, so the idea would be that such titles simply couldn't pass a proposal to be added to the platform: no one would vote for it.

Since NFTs only have value if there's applications that support them, we hope that developers will take advantage of other games' NFTs so there isn't a single point of failure for an NFTs' value. I.e. a sword NFT is useless if it's for one game, and that centralized game disappears. If the NFT is interoperable with multiple titles, the value survives.",gr5h9lb,2021-03-16 18:42:21,RektangularStudios,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/m6b4jx/introducing_the_novellia_gaming_platform_and_store/gr5h9lb/,1,0,,1,0,m6b4jx,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"custodial just means that somebody else (not yourself) is in control of the wallet, which means you need to trust that party to do what you ask with the assets in the wallet. That includes giving the assets up to another party if you ask them to!

Custodial wallets have advantages, the main one being if you don't trust yourself to store and keep the private keys of a wallet you own and manage, a non-custodial wallet.",hpk1x8n,2021-12-22 14:02:13,theTalkingMartlet,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/rknkjw/why_do_people_use_cnft_instead_of_jpgstore/hpk1x8n/,2,0,,2,0,rknkjw,comment

Minting on demand can be in order (asc/desc) or random and lots of other cool features and stuff.

CardanoNFTs,,"Yes, your scenario is literally the main solve this dApp is doing in alpha release. After this initial release I'll be building the secondary decentralized marketplace which will be tied to the smartcontract I'm creating for the primary market, wherein you can register a policy id and the royalty % for that policy. In fact I just finished the initial coding on that smartcontract and pushed to github. Not finished yet, but nearly and then the final work on the dApp and a bunch of testing. 

And I'd love it if you were one of the first users! Feel free to hmu in the chats.",hmhj2rv,2021-11-29 03:17:44,thebreathofatree,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/r4iv60/what_are_the_best_minting_services_that_supports/hmhj2rv/,4,0,,4,0,r4iv60,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"This is an open-source dApp project, I won't charge anything. How it works is:
- Install the dapp on a full node computer/server
- Run the setup/config:
--> You'll be prompted/guided walk through to config your nft drop campaign
--> At the end you'll be asked if you want to register your campaign's policy ID and associated royalty % in the new MintedWithLovelace global smartcontract registry...this is a smart contract to which, by saying ""yes"" and setting a royalty %, the dApp will then prompt you to send a transaction to the smartcontract, which will cost 2 ADA + tx fee to lock your registration which contains your policy ID and royalty. If you choose to update the royalty, that previous tx is refunded to you and you generate a new one for again, 2 ada, which is then registered at the smartcontract. At any time you can deregister and retrieve your 2 ADA. 

When the secondary market is released (shooting for Spring 2022) it will always check this registration smartcontract for any UTxO with your policy ID in the datum and enforce the royalty set if it finds one. So as long as you have registered, your royalty will be enforced on the MintedWithLovelace secondary market! 

If you're needing hands on support and guidance in the setup of your project I will be making myself available to a select few projects as my schedule and their needs/demands allow. For now, if that is something you are looking for the best thing would be to join the MintedWithLovelace discord and we can connect! 

MintedWithLovelace is, in my intention, a community driven project. I'm hoping more people will jump in and participate (like helping out with documentation, marketing, and even helping projects like you do any alternate configs that may deviate slightly from the built-in options of the dApp).  Not quite yet, but soon, I'll do some research and begin working on a plan for establishing some sort of organized structure so people who get involved are rewarded appropriately. And I'll put together a whitepaper (or maybe someone with experience doing these would jump in and join the community effort) as well as a better roadmap.  I'm a coder and an artist, so my focus is just on good solid working reliable dApp code atm.",hmk4qs9,2021-11-29 18:17:18,thebreathofatree,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/r4iv60/what_are_the_best_minting_services_that_supports/hmk4qs9/,3,0,,3,0,r4iv60,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"I have, in fact, 2 auction styles coded: traditional/timed and ""guess the reserve""

Traditional sets the policy id/locking height at the moment bid1 is received, based on the time you configure. So if you want a 24 hour auction, it will calculate the slots needed for 24 hours and upon 1st bid sets that locking height and the timer has begun. Highest bid at the end of the 24 hours wins and mints and all other bids and future bids are refunded automatically.  It relies on ""accumulated"" tx's for the bid of a particular wallet. So say you send 10 ADA as a 1st bid. Then get outbid for say 11. You can then send 2 ADA and your active bid is now 12 total. And it doesn't matter if you send from the same address, so long as the same wallet it will ""know"" it's the same person and assign the accumulated bid accordingly!  

""Guess the Reserve"" style auction, as it sounds, you set a secret price and if someone bids at or above it, they win instantly.  In this auction it's not ""accumulation"" based, rather you submit a bid and if it's below the reserve you just get a refund. You can pay for bidder's fees or compensate them with a native token you control. You can also use your native token to send back ""hints"". So someone tries 10 ADA and is far off the winning reserve, they would get a refund plus 10 (or however many) of your native tokens as a ""hint"" that they are far off. 90 might be a number of native tokens to tell them ""you're almost there!"". This is a work in progress feature, but it's still then possible to run a totally blockchain-based auction wherein even clues are being dropped on-chain for all to see!",hmk5c7e,2021-11-29 18:21:10,thebreathofatree,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/r4iv60/what_are_the_best_minting_services_that_supports/hmk5c7e/,2,0,,2,0,r4iv60,comment

i personally don't think it's expensive, since the service brings an extreme ease and another, you can add the 4.2 ADAs to the value of your NFT and then you receive the amount you normally intended since these ADAs are only charged if there is a sale of an NFT. when I make a drop I see the best price and add the cost to the final value, it has worked well!",hmir3ln,2021-11-29 11:34:39,delphiover,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/r4iv60/what_are_the_best_minting_services_that_supports/hmir3ln/,2,0,,2,0,r4iv60,comment

3. find out what are their long term plans with project of any artwork

CardanoNFTs,,"they just launched the marketplace yesterday. one awesome aspect is that they have royalties set up for assets that are bought and sold, as well as exceptional metadata that's a lot more room to work with than other places like nft-maker that I've used. Really amazing community working on this too, and the development team has been burning the candle at both ends to get this thing running before it opens to public listing on September 6. You can apply to be a verified creator on their platform before then, or just wait until after this weekend. check their [website](https://tokhun.io) and watch the tutorial. play around with the marketplace you find on there as well. I was using cnft.io previously too, but am not so much closely familiar with their team and what they're up to.

CardanoNFTs,AdaCards,"With the recent interest in Cardano NFTs, the pool I've been staking with for almost a year now has decided to dip their toes into the NFT market. I would like to introduce to you: AdaCards. 

Brought to you buy the Pool Operators over at VIPER Stake Pool and the guys who started adafolio!

AdaCards are unique NFT trading cards that memorializes a Cardano block and showcases the pool that minted it. They are still in the development stage, but if you want to follow along check out their Twitter for future giveaways and important dates:

CardanoNFTs,,"This is a wicked idea.

Edit: The dog started barking at the snow so I wasn’t able to finish writing originally.

I think this is a wicked idea as it’s the first (NFT that I’ve heard about) that really highlights the technology behind it. NFTs have been a hard pill to swallow for me so far, not being a collector of anything other than money (which I wish I was better at) and a few carpentry hand tools over the years.
Can’t quite find the personal value in things like Spacebudz or other digital art other than an additional form of value to try and increase the money collecting hobby.

But owning an AdaCard highlighting a block of a blockchain seems to me to be a cool thing to have and to keep. I’m in, now to chase the dream of getting a super rare one!",gtf2xrr,2021-04-05 03:58:02,tmpmsm,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mjjb03/adacards/gtf2xrr/,3,0,,3,0,mjjb03,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Hello, im one of Dracards founding members, and I would like to talk about my project: Dracards is a NFT Play to Earn card game, currently on pre-sale, a pioneer project within Cardano’s blockchain. The game’s economy is based on its recently released native token, FIRE, which has an exponencial promise of growth. By purchasing the token in advance, you’ll be investing in FIRE with a huge discount compared to its astounding growth projection. The project is beautifully illustrated, and it contains Pve and Pvp modes, all set in a medieval fantasy universe! Dracards offers the purchase of cards by booster packs, containing 5 sorted cards each. There are 5 different card types, based on their rarity: common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary. The rarer the card, the bigger its farm on PvE mode, and greater its power. On PvP mode, each victory on duels earns you Ember, the ingame currency that can be converted to FIRE - for selling or reinvesting on even greater cards.

Unfortunately, in this case, they are unique cards (many of them were already bought by other players and are now being resold).
Don't worry, because there are other ways to get involved in the project, for example, you can buy our Token (FIRE) and become an early adopter, and it could be worth it if the currency appreciates. Thinking as a player, you can use our Token to open a booster, and who knows, if you are very lucky you could get your own legendary card.

CardanoNFTs,Cardano vs Polygon for releasing NFT collection?,"I've been mulling over this decision for some time, but would love to hear your opinions...

I'm trying to decide where to release my NFT collection. I haven't yet finalized the size but it'll be between 3-5K unique pieces.

Today I participated (or tried to) in the Very Important Dummies drop, and was really bummed that I couldn't snag one. I really love the project. So many of these recent Cardano drops have kinda shit the bed on launch and left their community disappointed. On the other hand I can only imagine the pressure that's on these teams launching to handle the kind of traffic and fomo we're starting to see within the growing cNFT community.

Another option I've been looking at is releasing my collection via Polygon on Open Sea. The website and infrastructure is already there which would take the pressure off a development team. I know that a lot of people were starting to get deterred from ETH NFTs because of the gas fees, but they wouldn't have that issue if we released via Polygon.

Would love to hear your thoughts. I'm also still learning everything from the grassroots up so if I've gotten anything wrong in my statements above, please feel free to correct me. 

Thank you so much for your input!",pzf7ar,2021-10-01 19:25:32,dcroni,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pzf7ar/cardano_vs_polygon_for_releasing_nft_collection/,12,0,30,12,0,pzf7ar,post

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi! I just posted this yesterday: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/py8z91/heading\_for\_the\_open\_waters\_of\_cardano\_another/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/py8z91/heading_for_the_open_waters_of_cardano_another/)

My artist partner and I decided to scrap Polygon/Opensea and come here for a myriad of reasons, not least of which is something I didn't really touch on in that post, the decentralization factor. OpenSea is a user-friendly (for the most part) site but something I noticed when I was originally setting up my personal art on the platform, it was more centralized then I expected. Granted, some of that is temporary, allowing you to publish works and not ""mint"" them genuinely until later.  And while Cardano has fewer sites so far that offer the same or similar experience as OS, I do find that there's a more decentralized approach overall imo. Or maybe just because I'm waist deep in the cli stuff? :) Regardless, another important factor to us was having more ownership and control over our NFT experience. We aren't just firing off images with some metadata, we are telling a story that is slowly growing and expanding, and we didn't want the constraints of having to use this or that 3rd party site, and find ways of making it all flow. With Cardano we can just have our site, our social platforms, and mint things in a way that we fully understand and is fully transparently on the blockchain at the time of minting and release, verifiable to our wallet which is protected via a cold signing system, so people know they are getting something genuine, from the source, verifiably-so.  Idk, that part is cool to me at least :)

Also, we can mint non-NFT tokens! And that was a big plus to us as it's integral to what we are doing and what we want to do. We just minted 1 million JUDE tokens as part of our NFT experience and again, everything is transparent and verifiable. And lastly, this really is a much more fun experience then I anticipated. We are having a blast creating our experience of course, but this added another layer of fun and expanded our original idea to include a lot more interesting angles and side projects to come. It's just been a door opener in many ways and I cannot rave enough about Cardano XD

Ok, that's all! <3

edit: quick note, I'm pretty techy so minting was no problem for me, but I know many aren't.  I have a side project in the works that may be of help for that, still working on the rudamentary version of it, which is scripts, but I am planning an app as soon as I can juggle it into my busy schedule. For now you can see some of the baseline scripts from which I'm building this at [https://github.com/artistulla/](https://github.com/artistulla/) I think the repository is called mintingNFTs or something similar.  Very basic there, better stuff in the works.",hf0lpty,2021-10-01 20:23:03,thebreathofatree,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pzf7ar/cardano_vs_polygon_for_releasing_nft_collection/hf0lpty/,6,0,,6,0,pzf7ar,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"The season 2 launch today was quite horrendous for VeryImportantDummies. I was watching the clock and refreshed the website as soon as it struck 6pm. Took a few more refreshes for the buy button to show up, and as soon as I clicked on it, I got a ""Guest area"" page requesting a password, then error page. 

The communication was in shambles.. considering they were updating people late. They advised people to keep the address request pages open so they can stay in queue, then removed the buy button, then told people to close the previously opened pages and restart the process when the buy button was not even back on the page yet..now there are 80 dummies in limbo because they apparently are stuck in the reserved stage.

Altho I've been trading crypto and stocks for quite a while, this was actually my first attempt minting, and it was quite a disappointing experience tbh.. sorry for the rant.

CardanoNFTs,,"To be fair their first drop went exactly the same. I'm not into the dummies but i'm on a dedicated cnft discord server and the ones that where trying to mint said it was shit and left as they experienced the same issue last time dummies made a drop.

Looks like that project isn't on par with the recent hype for cnft's in other words they just don't have sufficient means to handle the traffic nor do they have the right tools to do a proper drop.

There have been other big drops like Alien Babies and Yummi Universe that had a whole lot more buyers (10k+ ppl on discord) that went a lot smoother last week.

Unfortunately you started off with the wrong project for your first minting it seems. Though I do have to admit every project currently has issues with minting. The Cardano scaling and usable tools haven't caught up with the massive interest in cnft's for now. But the biggest let down of some projects is the simple fact they are running a low end site that can't handle the traffic.

&#x200B;

Just a quick tip: Use Daedalus for minting, that's the only wallet that runs a full node with the Cardano blockchain. Other advised wallets like Yoroi/Nami use an API to communicate with the blockchain but that API seems to disfunction when loads of requests are being sent. And key to getting the much wanted cnfts for now is a fast (and working) wallet!",hf1463i,2021-10-01 22:49:10,fsidemaffia,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pzf7ar/cardano_vs_polygon_for_releasing_nft_collection/hf1463i/,1,0,,1,0,pzf7ar,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey Cardano community,  


There's a project that I've been working on that I'm hoping you guys are going to like, its bringing the first set of algorithmically generated camels to the Cardano blockchain. Not only do we have amazing artwork and creative, unique designs, we are bringing utility to our NFT's in the format of a game that will use your own camel (with its own specific attributes) to challenge and face-off to other users within the Camel Club.   


There are over 13 different camels up for grabs, with over 80 attributes up for grabs - no two camels will be the same!  


We are guaranteeing 5% of the proceeds to go towards the Afghanistan Refugee Crisis appeal via the British Red Cross, with several one-off editions being raffled off prior to launch day with 100% of proceeds going towards helping those less fortunate via the power of ADA.  


If you are interested in Cardano NFT's then check us out and see for yourself whether its something you'd be interest in, I don't think you'll be disappointed!  https://discord.gg/h7uXCCke",hdrrczx,2021-09-21 21:49:53,HarryEFC95,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pshjvt/exciting_project_viralnfts_has_some_nfts_that_can/hdrrczx/,1,0,,1,0,pshjvt,comment

CardanoNFTs,CardanoCubes NFT project - Cardano Plays Blockemon,"Inspired by the legendary Twitch event *Twitch Plays Pokémon*, we who develop and design the CardanoCube project figured that we wanted to bring some gamification and joy on to the actual Cardano blockchain. While at the same time visualize how lightning fast and cheap the Cardano network really is.

**The result:** Our Blockemon emulator, which is the first gaming application run on Cardano. The emulator is run by verified moves on the network. In the game (Pokémon Red), Charles is fighting  courageously against World. Have a look at [https://cardanocubes.com](https://cardanocubes.com/), and have your move forever stored on Cardano :D

We will randomly distribute 100 NFTs to Blockemon players a long the way.

Going forward, we will release ***CardanoCube NFTs*** and expand our live streamed games library run on the blockchain.

What would you guys like to see next? We appreciate all feedback <3

CardanoNFTs,Can NFTs Crack Royalties And Give More Value To Artists?,"""Right now, most NFTs are minted as ERC-721 tokens, which means that when an artist initially sells their work to a buyer, that will be the only time they receive money for the sale. If the buyer then flips it on a secondary market like OpenSea for 5 times the price, the original artist sees none of that...

Zach Burks and James Morgan authored an “Ethereum Improvement Proposal” or EIP-2981 to create an ERC-721 Royalty Standard. The main motivation of this is to create a modified NFT standard so that NFTs created, purchased, or sold on one marketplace still pay out royalties regardless of the next marketplace it is sold on. With this standard, it would be possible for the artist to set a royalty amount that can be paid to the creator on any marketplace that implements these tokens.""

Is it possible perpetual cross platform royalties with native tokens on Cardano?",mgunox,2021-03-31 01:07:09,Lemardt,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mgunox/can_nfts_crack_royalties_and_give_more_value_to/,12,0,4,12,0,mgunox,post
CardanoNFTs,,"There is a fundamental difference with Cardano NFT tokens: they are native tokens, which means they are not built on top of smart contract logic, but uses the same ledger model as ada. Monetary policies are defined by a policy script that controls only the minting or burning of a token.   


Once the user holds a native token, the transaction rules are the same as those applied in ada. There doesn't seem to be a ""native"" way to implement royalty as a token standard (as is happening in Ethereum) because there are no standards at all, no smart contract to impose rules on transactions.  


The only way I can see this kind of solution is a voluntary adoption by NFT marketplaces, which could use the token creator (artist) information present in the metadata to pay royalties part of the sale value.",gsxhn8e,2021-03-31 16:27:11,__lv,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mgunox/can_nfts_crack_royalties_and_give_more_value_to/gsxhn8e/,2,0,,2,0,mgunox,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"I thought Rarible already had this opinion? 
When you create NFTs with them it allows individuals to set a % of royalties. 

Would love it if Cardona would allow the same. Maybe even improve and expound, by having it so we can set a duration of time. I personally don't think I should get royalties indefinitely should have a block of time be it 5, 10, 15, 25 or so years. Maybe have it so the artist can choose a duration of time and a percentage. Or what would be interesting is a depreciating percentage, like 30% for first x number of years then over time it drops till last 5 years is 10% or something. Maybe even allow the artist a choice of two options, one is a set depreciating value of 30% to 10% over 25 years providing a longer duration than option two. Option two would be a fixed percentage for a shorter total period of time, with the fixed option the artist can select what percentage level fir the set duration of time. I'm not a numbers individual however it would work out better if the numbers are set in a way to make the depreciating option resulting in better long-term royalties than the short-term.",gswrass,2021-03-31 12:51:24,No-Importance-1214,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mgunox/can_nfts_crack_royalties_and_give_more_value_to/gswrass/,1,0,,1,0,mgunox,comment

Just keep Rule 1 in mind, this subreddit is for NFTs on the Cardano Blockchain and the marketplaces you listed are Etherium Marketplaces. But since it's not minted yet it's not breaking the rule.

(Obviously) I suggest looking into the many benefits of using Cardano's network over Etherium's. The downside right now with Cardano is that there aren't any marketplaces available, but there are many being worked on and hopefully won't be too long till they're here!

I've minted hundreds of thousands of NFTs for artist - many of which you've probably seen on [https://opencnft.io/](https://opencnft.io/) or purchased yourself. I offer customized minting services and make it extremely easy for buyers to buy from you.

DO NOT think that minting on a site like NFT-maker or Tokhun is cheaper or better than using a manual minter. Not only is that false, but you also won't get nearly the flexibility, options, or the possibility of obtaining your Policy ID keys. And as they say in the crypto World: Not your keys, not your NFTs.

Dropping 10K NFT's tomorrow? No problem. Want NFTs with crazy utility? No problem. If you can imagine it, I've done it and am happy to provide references or testimonials to my services. Ping me and let's talk about your project.",s3fwzu,2022-01-14 01:48:12,TYGAR-pool,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Minting Services'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/s3fwzu/if_you_are_an_artist_looking_for_a_minter/,10,0,6,10,1,s3fwzu,post

CardanoNFTs,,It’s better to do collections because then you can differentiate the level of rarerity like being series one would be the most rare then so on and so on. You never know when your art could have potential to a collector. Idk I’m also new to this so that’s how I see it. Some nfts even let you mash two or three nfts as space jams nft on nifty let’s you burn three space jam characters to make a goon squad member. (Fyi don’t do it it’s a waste I spent 100 on trying to unlock a rare goon.) wicked bone club is also doing something like this where if you have a ape and two hounds and 300 of there wicked tokens you get a 4th nft for free. Just for holding. Plus you get 10 wicked tokens per day for every ape you have.,hhnlgfb,2021-10-22 19:00:49,2kcallitaday,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/qdck44/am_i_artist_out_o_the_loop_if_i_try_to_make/hhnlgfb/,1,0,,1,0,qdck44,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi there friend. Do you know if the [tokhun.io](https://tokhun.io) team is much more active than the [cnft.io](https://cnft.io) team? 

I'm an author of a Cardano NFT art project and I started listing my art tokens on cnft a while ago. After nearly a month, my project & tokens has not been verified on cnft. If you go look at their Git repository, there's literally ONE person approving all of the commits once or twice a day.

There is a MASSIVE backlog of commit requests, where at least 20-30 project and token verification requests are coming in each day, yet there's only one repo moderator doing a few merges per day. Clearly, my project and my tokens will never be verified at this point, and thus won't appear on the marketplace.

I appreciate your reply. Thanks!",hekl10w,2021-09-28 07:59:53,Salty_Nutella,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/px02wa/tokhun_just_launched_its_auction_feature_and_the/hekl10w/,1,0,,1,0,px02wa,comment

CardanoNFTs,How to start in the universe of NFTs,"Hi!
I'm new to this entire crypto universe. The very first coin I bought was Cardano in the beginning of the year and since then I've become hooked. I love the project. And I love the concept of NFTs.
As of now I don't have an actual project, but I'm confident with the future.
I lack the technical skills, though.
What sources of learning would you suggest? YouTube channels, other subreddits...
How does one start learning? Policies, rarity, how to charge, how to actually mint the NFT and send it to the buyer...
Thanks in advance! I'm super serious about this. And I want to start investing in some cool projects too.
Enjoy your week!",pf0nxg,2021-08-31 06:59:05,RMHacker,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pf0nxg/how_to_start_in_the_universe_of_nfts/,11,0,16,11,0,pf0nxg,post

CardanoNFTs,Upping the Bar for Cardano NFTs - We are Better and Standards Matter,"Hey everyone - adosiawolf / Kyle Solomon here!

I apologize for not posting often here but will work to do better. I run the AdaFrog brand pools, manage the Catalyst funded Adosia IoT project and am a cofounder and board member of SPOCRA (stake pool operators collective representation assembly). I am also the creator of spacecoins and now jetchicken NFTs

Our community is growing rapidly - CF, IOG and everyone actively participating in the community can really feel this tremendous growth in community.

With the recent rise of native assets, we're seeing a massive influx of low quality NFT projects utilizing FOMO, inflated prices and mischaracterization of rarity so as to create a false sense of urgency in order to maximize near term revenue.

**Definition of rare:** \- (a thing) not found in large numbers **AND** consequently of interest or value

**Unpopular opinion** \- no one will care about a limited run of something easily forgotten

If we're going to cater to millions (and eventually billions) of users we need to formulate and adopt models that cater to millions of users. The killer mainstream NFT app in my mind would look something like tokenized in-game pickups accompanied by p2p marketplaces where players could buy/trade/sell items they picked up in games. A game like Fortnite or Apex Legends for example would be able to achieve this **AND** maintain the allure of rarity even across millions of users.

So in thinking about how can we cater to millions of users, Adam Dean and I formulated a concept for an NFT card pack game (jetchicken) capable of serving millions of users fairly - all without degrading NFT rarity potentials.

We eliminate FOMO and false urgency by only minting in real time (when a sale is made), by not limiting the number of card packs available, and by deploying a minting policy which expires at the end of the year.

The coolest thing about ""high volume"" user models is we can maintain extreme rarity potentials by enabling enough aspects of variation that the rarity potentials actually INCREASE with volume (e.g. odds of legendary features across numerous or all attributes are extremely low such that certain rarities will never be achieved in low volumes).

We welcome any any all feedback as standards come first - and we are in a position to influence and help maintain the high standards we have as a community.

If anyone is interested - here is a link to a few testimonials regarding the jetchicken experience: [https://twitter.com/ADAFrog\_Pool/status/1405935450133569542](https://twitter.com/ADAFrog_Pool/status/1405935450133569542)

And here is a link to the jetchicken site: [https://jetchicken.io](https://jetchicken.io/)

Thanks for your time and feedback if you made it this far! I am happy to answer any questions or discuss how we can better set standards for those that are here and for the millions of users that will be coming to Cardano.

CardanoNFTs,,"I agree with most of what you're saying.  There is, however something that is missed in this.  You're obviously well established in the community.  So if you release a project, you already have a baked in fan base that will definitely buy your assets.  That makes the effort that you put in to the project well worth it.  


What I've personally seen is some really good projects go down the tubes, because they've made a massive supply, and then interest wanes.  Yes there are collectors of NFT's.  But the majority of NFT's are being purchased by investors.  If an NFT that has a supply of 10k, starts to stall out at 2000, then that project is dead.  And all of the time, money, and effort put in to that project is for naught.  


Yes, there is allot, and I mean allot, of really low effort trash tokens being put out on the daily.  That needs to change.  But, we also see that most of those fails for obvious reasons.  


I think its okay to implement some exclusivity in to early batches.  This gives fans something special.  And its fairly common practice for things being sold outside of Cardano.  The example of trading cards is actually a very good one.  If you go to buy a Topps trading card today, there is a mostly unlimited supply.  But they can do that because of the years and years of building that brand to have a fan base to support it.  In the early days, they wouldnt have had as many for sale.  And of course those early trading cards are enormously valuable.  


If we eliminate the garbage projects from the conversation, any big project is going to require a substantial investment of time and money.  If the project doesnt return a profit, it wont be able to move on to improving it.  Its a really challenging market.  And everyone wants their project to succeed.  Configuring the payment structure, and rarities is a very delicate balance.",h2k42qy,2021-06-21 17:29:09,Huth_S0lo,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/o4wzbu/upping_the_bar_for_cardano_nfts_we_are_better_and/h2k42qy/,4,0,,4,0,o4wzbu,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"A model EVERY project can live by...

\- Set a time limit for their drop. If it sells out, cool! Good for you. More rarity.   
\- If it doesn't sell out, the remaining tokens burn.

This doesn't have to be complicated, but everybody is trying to sell 10,000 of something that only ended up selling between 1,000 and 2,000 of.

And that's what's nuts right now... a project will sell TWO THOUSAND of something and not be seen as massive success. Meanwhile, people are trying to sell ONE thing over on the ETH platform... and cNFT projects are being judged against the insane standards of 10,000+ sold.

About it being a bubble... we're pre-smart contracts. Cardano has not been FOMO'd into by ANY stretch of the imagination. So we're in a tight collector's market that is highly focused on rarities in large collections and where you can know pretty much EVERY important person in the space within a matter of a few days. This will inevitably grow and change as more projects with different models come into the space. But to call this space a bubble when other projects in the ETH space currently have a floor for commons of $2.5-3K? Naw. Sorry.

Currently, if you take out Space Budz and maybe the Claymates (maybe), the median price for most pieces being sold in the escrow marketplaces are between 100-200ADA. Are those high prices? Well, when's the last time you went into ANY art gallery? That's what art is sold for. Usually double that.

Once smart contracts launch, once actual marketplaces launch, once we start getting the big press and institutional investing... we'll look back on this time and think how naive we were about thinking 100 ADA was indicative of a bubble.",h2mj00o,2021-06-22 06:31:04,nitsujrendrag,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/o4wzbu/upping_the_bar_for_cardano_nfts_we_are_better_and/h2mj00o/,1,0,,1,0,o4wzbu,comment

CardanoNFTs,,">Yes there are collectors of NFT's.  But the majority of NFT's are being purchased by investors.

I can see where you're coming from

My personal opinion is the current NFT market is a bubble, and the reality is the idea of NFTs as an investment doesn't hold very well in the realm of fundamentals (which not where we play today of course) - with that being said there will most certainly be successful projects achieving long term collectibility which will also differ widely relevant to distributions models.I am looking into the realm of bringing sticky user volume  to Cardano - possibly different customer base entirely - meaning I'm not really playing the same game as traditional NFT drops",h2k5hm6,2021-06-21 17:39:33,adosiawolf,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/o4wzbu/upping_the_bar_for_cardano_nfts_we_are_better_and/h2k5hm6/,3,0,,3,0,o4wzbu,comment

CardanoNFTs,One of the best NFT projects cardano has ever had 🚀🚀🚀,"The CNFT market is flooded with projects, many end up being the same as always, large quantity and low quality, but there are some that end up standing out for bringing innovation, the one from Time Trotters ([https://timetrotterscnft.medium.com/time-trotters-not-your-average-nft-on-the-cardano-blockchain-fdceeeca194b](https://timetrotterscnft.medium.com/time-trotters-not-your-average-nft-on-the-cardano-blockchain-fdceeeca194b)) is simply insane good, created solutions to many problems that other projects had and brought a system that will keep the market running, which is you burn 2 simple to get 1 better .... so very anxious for him!

CardanoNFTs,,"Btw, People! We are working on the CryptoSLUG 2.0 Web.
The design is to be ready by the end of the comming week.
At their birth (mint), each of the 50 SLUGs got their random and unique properties like:

🦖 Hunger
🪨 Weight
👄 Radula
🐚 Notum
🧪 Toxicity
🥗 Omnivorous
👀 Tentacles
🦵 Foot Fringe

By the scale from 0 to 100% each.

Every SLUG is unique, there are no two of them with the same properties!

Properties were randomly defined at their birth, and there is no way to change them.
Buying now you have a chance to get the Best of them by the base price. 
In two weeks you can check your Slug properties. Then the stronger and fatter SLUGs will be more expansive according to their Level (from 1 to 10).
The weaker and skinny SLUGs will be cheaper.
But keep in mind, that the CryptoSLUGs battle 2.0 mechanic designed that way, it's difficult to know before the battle what Slug will win, despite the Mechanic it is 100% determined. A
Slug Level 6 can easilly beat a Slug Level 7 in certain combination of properties.
In a month you can fight with your SLUGs - ones in your wallet.",gvoxd17,2021-04-24 13:12:14,whitemane0,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mx4slw/crypto_slugs_50_collectible_cardano_nfts_5_ada/gvoxd17/,1,0,,1,0,mx4slw,comment

CardanoNFTs,Cardano Comics!,"Hey there,

We're a newly formed art project called Cardano Comics! Our focus is on paying homage to great comic book covers and using them to feature the heroic figures who are helping develop the Cardano Community!

We just announced the concept of our first edition Captain Cardano! It's based on the cover of Captain America issue #284 and will feature Charles Hoskinson as Captain Cardano. Issue #284 originally released on May 3rd, 1983. So we saw fit to pick May 3rd as our release date too!

You can find our Twitter page here [https://twitter.com/CardanoComics](https://twitter.com/CardanoComics)

And our reddit page here [https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoComics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoComics/) We've made an introductory post on our subreddit so you can learn more about Cardano Comics

Our website is still a work in progress so I wont link it quite yet but we'll make an announcement on our Twitter and subReddit once it's up.

CardanoNFTs,Where is the best place to list a Cardano NFT?,"Hi All,

I want to sell an NFT and was planning to list it on [CNFT.IO](https://CNFT.IO). However, after going through the process, I realized that you need to pay a 2.5% fee, which isn't something I'm typically used to in the NFT marketplace space. 

Is there another liquid NFT market where you can list your NFTs and not have to pay the fee, only gas fees?

Thank you!",t47pt3,2022-03-01 13:17:31,Sauce2323,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'General Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/t47pt3/where_is_the_best_place_to_list_a_cardano_nft/,10,0,12,10,0,t47pt3,post

CardanoNFTs,Scheduled CNFT Mints: 2/15 - 2/17,"This post is the beginning of what will, hopefully, drive quality discussion and sharing on the r/CardanoNFTs subreddit. Every week, for some time, I have made a weekly CNFT drop status report. A way of summarizing my opinions on what is likely to be worthwhile versus what is likely to be the exact opposite. While I am not always correct (no one can be), I often get lucky identifying at least the quick flip projects of interest.

&#x200B;

Details on drop times and links for the projects listed below can be found on our [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rcardanonfts%40gmail.com&ctz=UTC](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rcardanonfts%40gmail.com&ctz=UTC). Details about how projects are selected to be posted to the Drop Calendar and what the color rankings mean, can be found on our [https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoNFTs/about/wiki/create/cardanonfts/drop\_calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoNFTs/about/wiki/create/cardanonfts/drop_calendar) Wiki.

&#x200B;

There are obviously several other drops which are not listed here, the criteria used to determine which drops are kept and which are ignored, as well as the rankings, can be found at the above Wiki. To the extent that there are any disagreements on rankings or you feel a project has been missed, please comment below and let's chat about it. No system is perfect so would love to get more feedback on other methods people have used to review upcoming drops.

561f30306344270340cf4756c04b7dee6ee14b975972d40618344fce

2.3k/4.4k Twitter/Discord. Discord server has been fully boosted twice over but they have obviously run a few growth contests. At 5,555 to mint and a price of 40 ADA, I would keep them in the Neutral category, though they are right at the line to the Solid Project, TBH. Especially given that the CNFT market appears to be going through another downtrend of liquidity.

&#x200B;

**SUPREME ALIEN SOCIETY**

cb55b9b342fd107cf42714eef9d0465bc13ffd7da60985942fb1df41

1.5k/5.9k Twitter/Discord. Discord server is fully boosted once, barely, and there is little doubt that the current Discord count is artificial. At 7,777 to mint and a price of 50 ADA, I would put them to Red Flags category personally. Especially given that the CNFT market appears to be going through another downtrend of liquidity.

&#x200B;

**PufferFishClub**

2cb3a2c18f41189f4e831455a82eab77921a610fa6f5daa05062ca7c

1.4k/2.1k Twitter/Discord. Discord server is fully boosted once, barely, and there doesn't appear to be a lot of activity in the community. In total the project has 2,450 to mint but the Season 1 drop is only letting go of 300 with a cost of 34 ADA. They also have promised to buy of the minting floor and are planning on expanding utility via $PUFF token eventually. Despite the initial low cost and mint numbers, there are enough red flags on this one to drop in that category, including a ""doxxed"" team of only first names and similar promises to other compromised projects around floor purchases and giveaways.

&#x200B;

**The FunGuys**

09a05cce8bc7c8cb46a78c2b96bc2e10efdb214f17e2793c6b3bd5b0

3.2k/1.9k Twitter/Discord. Discord server is not fully boosted but they aren't advertising the boost so it is possible that it just hasn't occurred to the community to do so. In total the project has 2050 to mint at a cost of 35 ADA. They also have a 250 spot WL that is filled and has a 3 hour head start on minting. This will be a good measure of interest pre-public mint. If the WL isn't biting, than neither will the public. Personally, the only thing that keeps this from moving to a Solid Project for me is the lack of engagement on the Announcement posts. The community feels like it is legit but I'm not sure we see a floor above mint for very long. Because of this, I'm keeping in the Neutral spot.

&#x200B;

**ChibiKids Kingdom**

2934ea1dc4edc647e8dc488df17d00cb0a6d1e0f276c6d2f1db94753

2.8k/980 Twitter/Discord. Discord is not fully boosted and appears to be largely inactive. Previous mint on 12/23 appears to have had issues but all posts about them have been removed. Project only has 1000 to mint but very little aobut this project feels safe to me personally. Solidly in the Red Flags group.

&#x200B;

**LuckyPlanet**

e847a14c07f4ba94e18af4fac2fa3d462c1e95c26d77315603066e08

5.6k/3.8k Twitter/Discord. Discord is partially boosted but they also do not appear to be advertising the boost so most likely the community just isn't bothering. The current floor for S1 is around 175 ADA and S2 is over 100. With the limited mint of 299 and even with the higher price of 60 ADA, this is a ""Solid Project"" in my book. Good luck to anyone trying to queue up a transaction with only 299 slots available!

&#x200B;

**StoneyDuck**

fe1b6678be32a894595cef982742457627a56ff494b6ea71189784f3

1.7k/800 Twitter/Discord. Discord is not boosted and engagement in the project appears to be at a standstill. Inspired by the South Park episode and Butter's obsession with NFTs, the art work fits that but even with the limited mint of only 500 and a cost of 38 ADA, it is unlikely to make any waves, IMO and the complete lack of engagement is showing all sorts of flags.

&#x200B;

**Bloc Island**

bc9dacb919621fa67e77e5d2d17c5811fafe16af2c691e3076c0182d

1.6k/1.6k Twitter/Discord. Server engagement appears to be low and only saving grace looks like dedication of project team to provide updates and roadmap and the cost. At 35 ADA and only 3000 available, there is some room for action on this one. However, with the state of the market currently and the fact that a few other mints will likely take some attention, and money, away from this one, this one will stay a Netural though legit on the fence for Red Flag.

&#x200B;

**Adaku Tribe**

&#x200B;

1.5k/2.1k Twitter/Discord. Discord is barely fully boosted. Has invitation WL which is also not fully filled at this time. Project has limited community engagement at a 7,777 mint quantity is not going to be ablt over come the 35 ADA cost. I also can't find the PolicyID for the project anywhere... This is Red Flag project for me.

&#x200B;

**Filthy Rich Horses**

4addaad7f0319c2f66857a35d3d7257f9ee426a6a3aefa139277a2b9

1.9k/4.9k Twitter/Discord. Discord server is fully boosted once and has reasonable engagement. WL has about 2k already filled spots and total supply is 10k with a cost of 80 ADA each. This one is honestly a tough one for me because it SHOULD be a Solid Project but because of the state of the market, the total supply, and high cost, I think it will struggle to get through its full mint. Keeping this neutral for now but we may see it move one direction or the other as we near the public mint, especially since the WL is hitting in 24 hours early.

&#x200B;

**Team Thulu**

c71279e0954dfc999a8f5cf7c703a0b31c52d26518012eebf3a9fd17

1.7k/1.5k Twitter/Discord. Discord is boosted twice over and has reasonable engagement for the size. Total supply is 4500 with a cost of 42 ADA. Their growth has been relatively quick in a short amount of time but it appears generally organic. Despite the engagement and the lowish supply, the instant popularity is a bit concerning and there are some similar accusations to the BCRC scandal around stolen artwork. Obviously none of this confirmed but it is enough to keep at a lower neutral for me.",ssyzmb,2022-02-15 09:20:12,gafgarian,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Upcoming Drops'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ssyzmb/scheduled_cnft_mints_215_217/,10,0,10,10,1,ssyzmb,post

CardanoNFTs,,"That’s a broad generalization, and not really true.  The best services don’t mint an nft until a buyer is a found.  Aka Buffy bot, nft maker, digital syndicate, etc, etc.  And really the biggest flaw here, is you using all the same policy.  Is your policy verified (I’m sure the answer is yes).  Well nothing stopping people from minting a copy of a spacebud/clay mate/etc, and using your verified policy to sell it on cnft.Io.",hlfztqu,2021-11-20 23:25:44,Huth_S0lo,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/qy8as8/secure_multisignature_transaction_for_selling_and/hlfztqu/,1,0,,1,0,qy8as8,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"Yes this is true but this is exactly what’s happening here. A buyer clicks on “buy” on the website and the front end builds the transaction for minting a not yet minted NFT under the policy of the seller. Also, the buyer sends ADA to the seller. Once signed, the transaction is sent to the seller, because it still requires a signature for the policy. The seller checks the transaction and signs.

CardanoNFTs,,"Okay yeah, I looked up one of your tokens.  And I see what you're saying.  The buyers is basically minting their own token, making it a single transaction instead of 2.  Its kind of cool.  And if it works for you, thats awesome.  But I dont like the idea that it only works with Nami wallet.  Nami's alright.  Its yet to be proven if it cant be hacked with malicious code.  Thats literally all these websites are doing is looping up to the wallet, which gives the website immense amounts of power.  For that reason I dont use any of these kinds of services.

CardanoNFTs,,"I would be remiss if I didnt come back and reply again.  It didnt occur to me until just now, that your system is rather brilliant.  In the two transaction approach, the buyer sends ada, and you mint/return the token in a separate transaction.  By doing it this way, the NFT has to be attached to ada in its arriving UTxO, forcing you to part with about 1.5 ada (ignoring the tx fees).  By doing it your way, you're attaching the new NFT to the buyers return UTxO; thus keeping 100% of the profit.  Thats fucking genious.  High five dude.  Now just figure out how to do it without Nami, and you've just cornered the entire market.",hlg4828,2021-11-20 23:59:22,Huth_S0lo,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/qy8as8/secure_multisignature_transaction_for_selling_and/hlg4828/,1,0,,1,0,qy8as8,comment

Hey Cardano community,  


There's a project that I've been working on that I'm hoping you guys are going to like, its bringing the first set of algorithmically generated camels to the Cardano blockchain. Not only do we have amazing artwork and creative, unique designs, we are bringing utility to our NFT's in the format of a game that will use your own camel (with its own specific attributes) to challenge and face-off to other users within the Camel Club.   


There are over 13 different camels up for grabs, with over 80 attributes up for grabs - no two camels will be the same!  


We are guaranteeing 5% of the proceeds to go towards the Afghanistan Refugee Crisis appeal via the British Red Cross, with several one-off editions being raffled off prior to launch day with 100% of proceeds going towards helping those less fortunate via the power of ADA.  


If you are interested in Cardano NFT's then check us out and see for yourself whether its something you'd be interest in, I don't think you'll be disappointed!  https://discord.gg/h7uXCCke",hdrrh8g,2021-09-21 21:50:45,HarryEFC95,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/psfhm6/looking_for_some_promising_small_projects_less/hdrrh8g/,2,0,,2,0,psfhm6,comment

CardanoNFTs,CNFT Crawler - Discord Price Alert Bot for CNFT.io,"Hello fellow CNFT Enthusiasts,

we coded a Discord Bot for Price Alerts on [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io)

We still search some people who want to use it to catch good deals :) 

The Bot searches every 10seconds all listings for items with tags you can configure.

You can easily try it out.

Some Examples for alert:

 $alert\_add my\_first\_frog\_alert -s Spacebud -p 10000 -t type=frog -t #traits=4 -t !traits=chestplate

This alert notifies you everytime someone lists an Spacebud Type Frog with 4 traits and no chestplate.

 $asset\_find -s ""Cardano Kidz NFT 0056"" -p 950 

This Command searches all listings for Cardano Kidz NFT 0056 asset BELOW 950 ADA

&#x200B;

If you like using our bot for free some days we would ask you to get a membership so that we can cover the costs :) but first try it out and snag some cheap deals!

Join our Discord and try it out if you want: [https://discord.gg/UpN3hA5ypS](https://discord.gg/UpN3hA5ypS)

  
 

&#x200B;

Here are some examples of our commands:

 $alerts \[-h\]  List all alerts.  optional arguments:   -h, --help  show this help message and exit   
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 $alert\_add \[-h\] -s SEARCH\_STRING \[-p PRICE\] \[-t TAGS\] name  

Add an alert. The alert triggers a notification for a token, if 

1) SEARCH\_STRING is contained in the asset name, **and** 

2) the asset-price is smaller than PRICE, **and** 

3) all token conditions are fulfilled. Everything is case insensitive. 

Use quotes for spaces in strings such as ""Best Crawler ever"". 

For any tag xyz, the following tag conditions are supported: 

i)   xyz=abc -- xyz must have value abc 

ii)  #xyz=3 -- the value of xyz is a list and has exactly 3 entries 

iii) !xyz=abc -- xyz must not have value abc.  positional arguments:   name   Name of the alert.  

optional arguments:   

\-h, --help        show this help message and exit   

\-s SEARCH\_STRING  Search string   -p PRICE          Maximum price   -t TAGS           Tag conditions  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


$alert\_del \[-h\] name  Remove the given alert.  positional arguments:   name        alert name  optional arguments:   -h, --help  show this help message and exit",ppad0h,2021-09-16 10:04:18,knoflinger,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ppad0h/cnft_crawler_discord_price_alert_bot_for_cnftio/,11,0,1,11,0,ppad0h,post

They aim to make a NFT game, which is something different from the thousands of avatars around. Almost all of their NFTs have some kind of utility and you benefit from holding.

But also the art is top notch, which is also minted as collectable NFTs.

CardanoNFTs,,"If you'd like to invest in a high quality auction with some of the most diverse, professional artists and curators from around the globe, you should join artano.io's first auction on July 29-30 (48h). Starting bid is 50 ADA, and there are 15 artists + 3 curators involved with 15 pieces overall.

It'll also introduce iNFTs which are NFTs that change with different variables, the first of which is time. Some pieces will loop through day/night cycles, or seasonal cycles. Others will age.

Let me know if you have any questions or need any help, all bidders get 50 $ARTA for free, which can be used to purchase art in the future and vote on features, council members and even used to become a community curator.

(also if this all sounds interesting, vote Artano in Fund5)

CardanoNFTs,The Million ADA Homepage,"I love this community. With all the  excitement around smart contract rolling out later this year, I decided  to start a project called the Million ADA Homepage.  The premise is  similar to Reddit Place or the original Million Dollar Homepage, with a  Cardano/NFT spin.

There will be a  million pixel homepage where each pixel can be bought for 1 ADA. Each  pixel will be represented as a NFT/Token, which will store meta data  about what pixel it corresponds to. The owner of a pixel will have  continuous rights to change that pixels color value. Since these pixels  will be NFTs/Tokens, any pixel can be sold or traded to whom ever you  like.

I want this project to be  one of the first big charity fund raisers in the Cardano ecosystem. I  will donate at least 50% (500,000 ADA) of all profits to the charity of  our choice, and I do mean our choice. I plan to add a governance feature  so that holders in this project can vote on where we donate to and how  this project will evolve overtime.

I know fund5 is just around the corner so check out our [proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Million-ADA-Homepage/352012-48088).  We are under Prosper Outreach because this project is about bringing  people into the Cardano ecosystem and raising money for charity. The  proposal has many flaws, I had to finish it during my finals, so please  ask questions. I plan on posting content on our developing [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTtkm0_bOFGEj7u8YZnJpkQ) channel and hosting Q/A session ,to be more informative and transparent about our project.

I would love to answer any question you have or learn from your suggestions.

CardanoNFTs,How to get started?,"I like the academic and noble vision of Cardano. I'd like to start a non-profit charity funded by ADA purchases of NFT's that all go towards a good cause. I have no technical know-how about developing a dapp, but I'm not opposed to starting a native token that users could use.

My question is what's the best approach? In what's essentially an ADA only ebay of charity NFTs centered around a specific theme, should I just register a trademark, make a (centralized) site and start auctioning NFTs for ADA? Or should I hire a developer to be more integrated into the cardano ecosystem?

current state of NFTs on Cardano only features a nicely done minting process - but nothing for the aftermarket. I’ve outlined the current state in a bit more depth in a article https://link.medium.com/IYRw9KCajfb

My advice would be to wait until smart contracts roll out. Those will give you more acceptance and are scheduled to summer this year. But a lot of tutorials, playgrounds and lessons are coming to the testnet.

CardanoNFTs,Presale reviews,"Hi, I have been recently part of two NFT presale events on Cardano and wanted to give you my personal review of how the events went - the good, the bad and the ugly.

**SpaceBudz** \- [https://spacebudz.io/](https://spacebudz.io/)

10 000 unique collectibles

*Design:* I love it - animals in spacesuits. All tokens stored on IPFS, so they should be persistent.

*Execution:* Very smooth, the whole process was automated. There was a unique address and time window generated for each user. Once you sent the specified amount of ADA to the provided address in the 15 minutes long window, you received random NFT SpaceBud in a separate transaction - pretty much immediately. There is an explorer on their website showing who owns which token and you can search for various combinations of gadgets and species there.

*Price:* Each bud was between 10 and 100 ADA, based on how fast did you jump in. The whole event was done in \~2 days and buds are now trading for at least 1000 ADA on the official discord. Most people are waiting for smart contract, though, that will open the marketplace on their site and automate the whole process.

*The ugly:* There was 4 duplicates during the minting process. Founders where trying to hunt them down and burn the duplicate tokens. Not sure how did that happen - something wrong in the minting policy (I would love to hear why this happened if someone knows in the comments)?

**CardanoBits** \- [https://cardanobits.art/](https://cardanobits.art/)

10 000 unique collectibles

*Design:* 8 bit pixel art - reminds of CryptoPunks

*Execution:* This was not an automated process. They launched a Google sheet and there were just 10 addresses used by everyone (one per price slot - same pricing strategy as SpaceBudz). You were supposed to sent the specified amount to the address and wait for the founders to go through the transaction later and distribute the NFTs later. The sale was done in less than 1 hour due to enormous demand for this collection and Yoroi was crashing during this time period (perhaps it could be a warning flag for Yoroi team since this was a nice stress test of their loadbalancing capacity).

At the moment the creators are going through the submitted transactions and sorting them to know, which ones will get the NFT and which one will receive a refund.

*Price:* Each bud was between 10 and 100 ADA, based on how fast did you jump in.

*The ugly:* The non-automated process and waiting for the actual NFTs after the presale event is very disappointing. Moreover, there are more transactions for each price slot than intended so not everyone will get what they paid for (it is expected to receive refunds for those unlucky ones).

Do you have comments? Or perhaps you took part of another NFT sale and want to share? Give me your input in the comments :)",mlxq3k,2021-04-07 08:41:11,Smedzlatko,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mlxq3k/presale_reviews/,10,0,5,10,0,mlxq3k,post
CardanoNFTs,,"> The ugly: There was 4 duplicates during the minting process. Founders where trying to hunt them down and burn the duplicate tokens. Not sure how did that happen - something wrong in the minting policy (I would love to hear why this happened if someone knows in the comments)?

As far as I understand current limitations on the minting policy only can be set in two ways (which can be combined):

- the keys which need to be used to sign

- a slot number after/before which minting is allowed

So if you buy a NFT on Cardano right now you basically trust the founder that they won't mint more than they promised. That is the risk you take for being early. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

That said, I think the Spacebudz Team pulled the whole thing off as good as it gets right now and they earned my trust through their communication & hard work.

Also there aren't really serious reasons for people behind NFT projects to break their promises, their whole project would be worthless. IMHO as long as you get a token, you're probably good.",gtotny2,2021-04-07 14:04:49,dinogazenerd,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mlxq3k/presale_reviews/gtotny2/,2,0,,2,0,mlxq3k,comment

Meanwhile, plenty of people who sent in money didn't get one and have to wait for these guys to get their shit together and process the refunds.

CardanoNFTs,,"That's the idea.

Before you buy a token, always, always, always check the monetary policy. Make sure that you agree with it.

Certain policies may allow the creators to mint more of a token whenever they want. Now, there are certain assets for which this is okay. If a company want to run their loyalty points program as an asset on Cardano, they should be able to mint more whenever they want.

But for something like an NFT, the creator shouldn't be able to mint more than one. That would ruin the whole point of it being an NFT.",gtox5zh,2021-04-07 14:32:07,yottalogical,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mlxq3k/presale_reviews/gtox5zh/,1,0,,1,0,mlxq3k,comment

CardanoNFTs,Can any digital asset be an NFT? (and some follow up questions),"# 1_ Can any digital asset be an NFT?

Some specific examples:

* Folders (compressed or not)
* 3D models
* Books
* Software
* Python projects

1.1\_ Where is it determined what an NFT can be? Cardanon's network, the marketplace you upload it to, both, somewhere else?

&#x200B;

# 2_ Is there a limit on the size of the asset?

2.1\_ If so, where is the ""max size per NFT"" determined? 

&#x200B;

# 3_  Is it possible for the asset to be edited after it was turned into an NFT?

Quick example:

* If a .txt file could be an NFT, could a text file created by one person then sent to another person who can edit it and sent it to another person as the edited version?

Obviously, you wouldn't want this in most cases, I'm just curious.

3.1\_  If it is possible, who determines whether an NFT can be changed?",lt7l7h,2021-02-26 20:54:58,TYLRwithspaces,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/lt7l7h/can_any_digital_asset_be_an_nft_and_some_follow/,11,0,4,11,0,lt7l7h,post
CardanoNFTs,,"From a laypersons use of art NFT's what I've found is below. Someone with more tech knowledge can probably answer better but here goes. 

Pretty much anything can be an nft. Take a look at rarible. 

There usually is a file size limit. This is likely to be determined, by the marketplace.

Original NFT's had to be burned if you wanted an edit but you can now specify NFT's that can be altered and tailored. For instance if it was an art piece you could change certain elements on it.

CardanoNFTs,,"Any digital asset can be an NFT, and the NFT itself is used as rights/ownership of those digital assets. Again, an NFT can be anything, only the platform you use dictates what can be done with it, where the data or files are stored, etc.  Coming from the perspective of ETH, you could (but wouldn't want to) store the data on chain and it would be limited in size and prohibitively expensive to do anything with. In all cases your NFT would allow you to access the digital asset off the chain.
 
The best use cases for uses NFTs as an emblem vault for digital assets would leverage IPFS/filecoin/siacoin style of decentralized cloud hosting. Basically making the ""size"" of what your NFT can transfer to be limitless.
 
Again, taking the idea that NFTs represent ownership of *something*, you would be able to do the following as an example:  Create .txt file, upload to IPFS, create  an NFT with the  encrypted password to access the .txt file, transfer the NFT to whoever you want to edit the document (they would need the NFT in his wallet and perhaps the data/password that's stored within it too), that person can then edit the file, and transfer the NFT token of ownership to the next person to edit the .txt file.",gpccnty,2021-03-01 21:12:01,Unfledged_fledgling,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/lt7l7h/can_any_digital_asset_be_an_nft_and_some_follow/gpccnty/,2,0,,2,0,lt7l7h,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Genuine question -->

How is this a NFT - non-fungible token (i.e. 1 unique token) - if the exact same thing is on Ethereum network and you want to also put it on the Cardano network? You would have two identical copies of the same image (unless the Cardano network one is different somehow). Isn't that just the same as 'copy and paste'. Wouldn't the buyer on Ethereum feel duped if he thought he a one of a kind, only to see that someone has the 'exact' same thing but on another blockchain?

To me, personally - this is like a painter - painting the exact same - completely identically (so no one can spot any differences) - on two canvases. Sure the canvases might be different thicknesses - but the artwork is what any collector is paying for not the canvas. The painter cannot say he has painted 1 unique (non fungible) painting if it is on two different canvas thicknesses.

Maybe it's just me - but if you want to have a collection across different blockchains (something I am working on), then there needs to be some clear differences between NFT artwork.",hufd5ax,2022-01-27 11:30:44,sub1980,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/sdpt3z/how_can_i_list_the_greatest_collab_in_cardano/hufd5ax/,3,0,,3,0,sdpt3z,comment

CardanoNFTs,There has been information circulating around that certain marketplaces have an exploit in the smart contract. This is why we need to open source and audit as much of our projects as possible!,"Hey everyone,

Hope you're having a blast of a week. I just wanted to quickly discuss the smart contract drama going on on some marketplaces. There seems to be a bug (that hasn't been exploited yet, but might be since the whistle has been blown).

I'd like to remind you that the most sturdy and secure code is the one written in Haskell and that smart contracts can be both open sourced AND audited by comptetent people (also from IOG).

If your marketplace is affected, please delist your NFTs. I don't have a full list and I don't want to call anyone out, but make sure your assets are safe and stick to marketplaces that don't just copy and paste code from each other.

Again, hope you're safe and see you around in the metaverse.

CardanoNFTs,Issues with the Network when mass minting occurs,"Hi guys,

So recently we've seen multiple cNFT releases which seem to break the API requests being sent.

For example the wallets, like Nami and Yoroi - it seems there is a issue with Blockfrost API crashing which IIRC most developers use instead of running their own full node.

Is this not going to cause problems further down the line? If 15,000 people can't participate in a NFT Mint how can Cardano overtake ETH/Solana as a platform for NFT releases?

I would like to know opinions of Developers as it seems to me this is a major issue which needs to be addressed.",puuh49,2021-09-24 22:55:44,3hkapparel,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/puuh49/issues_with_the_network_when_mass_minting_occurs/,9,0,3,9,0,puuh49,post

CardanoNFTs,Cardoggo's - Upcoming CNFT,"**WHAT ARE CARDOGGO'S?**

Cardoggo's are NFT dogs on the Cardano network. This means that each dog is unique, and at most 2,000 will ever exist. When you buy one, the dog you receive and its accessories are random! And unless you send it elsewhere, it's yours forever.

&#x200B;

[Cardoggo's](https://i.redd.it/bu2w1wv55qm71.gif)

&#x200B;

**WHEN AND WHERE CAN I BUY CARDOGGO'S?**

[https://cardoggos.com/](https://cardoggos.com/)  Sept 12th - 5pm UTC

&#x200B;

**WHICH WALLETS ARE SUPPORTED?**

Yoroi and Deadalus support native tokens and are recommended. If you're new to crypto, I recommend Yoroi. Others may work as well, but please use them at your own risk.

&#x200B;

**HOW MUCH DO CARDOGGO'S COST?**

Cardoggo's cost 20 ADA to mint. When you checkout, to meet the minimum transaction size, we include an additional 1.5 ADA that will be sent back to you along with your NFT.

&#x200B;

**WHAT MAKES CARDOGGO'S NFTS?**

Only one of each Cardoggo will ever be minted, and the Cardoggo's minting policy will not allow any Cardoggo's to be minted after a certain date passes. Once that date has passed, the number of Cardoggo's will be locked forever.

&#x200B;

**CARDOGGO ROYALTIES**

The first account that mints each Cardoggo will receive lifetime royalties at 5% everytime that cardoggo is sold.

CardanoNFTs,💥💥💥One of the first games on Cardano is now LIVE! - SushiFights is NOW LIVE! 💥💥💥,"We have **EXCITING** news! SushiBytes just made history. Our SushiBytes battle game is one of the first games on Cardano! The concept is similar to Pokémon in that SushiBytes battle each other for XP and can be leveled up. ⚔️⚔️⚔️⚔️ Play here at: [https://fight.sushibyte.io/](https://fight.sushibyte.io/)

🚨 WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THE BATTLE GAME SO FAR 🚨

* Players will be able to pick Sushibytes from their wallet to participate in a battle with another randomly selected minted Sushibyte.
* When you click “Fight” you have a chance to either win or lose a battle against the other SushiByte (top right)
* Sushibytes battle for XP. Currently the outcome of the battle (win/lose) is determined by both Sushibyte's XP and level. Whether you win or lose the fight is random chance, so you can increase your chance by upleveling your SushiByte’s XP.
* The amount of XP rewarded from each battle is based on if the Sushibyte wins or loses the battle. After each battle there will be a cool down so your Sushibyte has a chance to rest and prepare for the next battle.
* The game is a Progressive Web App which means it can be played on desktop or on mobile browsers as well with the additional option to install as an app.​​
* ​The Beta phase, now until smart contracts, will be the **ONLY** time that you can **level up your SushiBytes for free** without incurring additional on-chain costs.

🚨 SOME FEATURES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXPLORED 🚨

* Leaderboards
* The ability to view other SushiBytes and their levels.
* Community tournaments.
* Migrating SushiFights to on-chain via smart contracts with a goal of preserving each SushiBytes' experience points and levels.
* Improving game mechanics to account for additional SushiByte abilities. Our ultimate goal is to make a Pokemon style game that makes use of the metadata, however, SushiByte metadata attributes will not currently play a role in the outcome of the battle. Sorry,🤚 KarateKid, you might lose to a Spam!
* More user interactions to determine the outcome of battles.
* Trading SushiBytes directly on our website.
* Adding micro-economies for SushiBytes.

To learn more, follow us on Twitter (Sushi\_Bytes), check out our website [https://www.sushibyte.io/](https://www.sushibyte.io/), and join our Discord [https://discord.com/invite/FHj63eJP](https://discord.com/invite/FHj63eJP). To purchase a SushiByte, go to [https://app.sushibyte.io/](https://app.sushibyte.io/). To fight, go here [https://fight.sushibyte.io/](https://fight.sushibyte.io/). Happy battling!

CardanoNFTs,,"Hey there - our pool has been minting tons of NFT's for artists and our delegates. Happy to assist you and answer any questions. For now, here's a quick explanation of what's going on:

There are LOTS of exciting Cardano NFT projects out there such as CardanoBits, Crypto Knitties, SpaceBudz, and CardanoKidz to name a few! As a fun extra, you can view all of the tokens being minted and transferred in real time here:

[https://pool.pm/tokens](https://pool.pm/tokens)

So! How is it being done? Well, first, I think its important to clarify that you can't (yet) actually mint a true NFT on Cardano, and you can't mint an image. What you CAN do, is:

1. Mint a single native token.
2. Include meta data to the location of an image inside of that token.
3. Send that native token to someone and claim that whoever holds it is the owner of the image.

For example, [here's the metadata of a native SpaceBudz token](https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/ade24a3457e1f6f40798bbfc587bee73f387925b19c94b1176a97ec5eba0bc84?tab=metadata):

{ d5e6bf0500378d4f0da4e8dde6becec7621cd8cbf5cbb9b87013d4cc: { SpaceBud6003: { arweaveId: ""tIshQuwGf0ckjBfXbNKy5PDrFbfYWChSqh8o9KR\_cbI"", image: ""ipfs://Qmevsugj5bRsTiWDAJkAfEpGgUmUCcxp2BEK8R7xZqT1vr"", name: ""SpaceBud #6003"", traits: \[ ""Chestplate"", ""Pistol"" \], type: ""Tiger"" } } }

You'll see they hosted the image on a couple of repository's such as ipfs and arweave and simply referenced them inside of the meta data for the token they minted so that it's forever documented on the blockchain.

Sort of a hack-y way to have a Cardano NFT but it's what we have at the moment!

As for fees - just a transaction fee is all it takes to mint tokens. Less than 2Ada!",gtpyd6l,2021-04-07 19:00:14,TYGAR-pool,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mlk7s2/how_to_mint_nft_on_cardano/gtpyd6l/,3,0,,3,0,mlk7s2,comment

CardanoNFTs,Blocktune - 1st NFT Melody on Cardano Blockchain.,"Russian Musician - Alexander Tkhomirov composed a melody specially to be issued as Cardano NFT and called it ""Blocktune"".

I've released it as as 12 tockens carring HEX-code of the source file in MIDI format.

As there is no running NFT Music Marketplace on Cardano Blockchain yet, I did my own:

**ø «BLOCKOMOTIVE»** \- *World-First* Cardano NFT Marketplace Up-and-Running. It should became the locomotive 🚂 of NFT music popularization on Cardano Blockchain and NFT support improvement on Cardano, as well as tribute to NFT hype.

You can check this out on [https://whiteman.ru/blockomotive](https://whiteman.ru/blockomotive)

There is only one item there yet - **""Blocktune""** by Alexander **Tikhomirov**.

If you want to release your music on **ø «BLOCKOMOTIVE»** \- drop me a message.

**UP.**

I going to move **ø «BLOCKOMOTIVE»** tomorrow to it's own address: [https://blockomotive.xyz](https://blockomotive.xyz)

Unforunately I can't afford [blockomotive.io](https://blockomotive.io), if someone would like to donate me [blockomotive.io](https://blockomotive.io) domain, Alexander allowed me to sent 1 ""Blocktune"" Set of Tockens to this person as a sign of a gratitude.

**UP2.**
First lot of 3 “blocktune” was bought with ADA!

CardanoNFTs,Thanks for creating the group for this most awesome Cardano community!,"So.... I'm a Cardano enthusiast and new to the crypto and NFT space. The bulk of my crypto is in Cardano because I think this tech is going to change the world in a huge and positive way. I created a few NFT's on Mintable (gasless free minting) but? I'm not too keen on Ethereum for Token creation (who is right?) because of the fees/metamask/etc.etc. and the buyer would incur these fees which seems a little whack to me.... (though I do enjoy many things about Mintable and it seems like a cool project). Does anybody have a step by step instruction set for a noob like myself to get all my ducks in a row for NFT projects on Cardano? And a rough time frame for when this project will be useable for such a crypto and tech noob like myself? And..... should I move my Cardano to Yoroi Wallet to be a better member of this community? Cardano is BY FAR the crypto for me and I'm ""Ride or Die"" all the way..... I look forward to actually USING Cardano and it seems like that is right around the corner.... I also heavily enjoy Charles' youtube videos and he is a very entertaining dude that seems pretty determined to be a gamechanger (what Cardano plans for Ethiopia and other African countries looks like it will be awesome for people) .... and people need for the game to be changed right now.

CardanoNFTs,CryptoDino: Cardanos First P2E game (links at the bottom of the description),"CryptoDino is a P2E IDLE game (think of the mobile game Fallout Shelter) with breeding mechanics on the Cardano blockchain that’s set to release their in-game currency called DinoCoins and breeding by the end of this month. The game itself will be released in Q2 22’. There is great potential for this project to become the Axie Infinity of Cardano. The Team is based in Poland and the developer for the game is a company called **MouseTrap**, also based in Poland. This game will be available on mobile as well as PC. This project is the real deal.

**As of right now:**

\-This project already has a functioning Smart Contract Marketplace on their website.

\-Breeding Simulator on their website

\-This Team has hit every target they have set out so far.

\-You can also check out their game sneak preview on their twitter

\- They have the most organically grown, wholesome, and supportive community in the CNFT space, in my opinion (this rings true especially in their Discord).

There are 10,000 Dinos as well as 10,000 DinoSaviors that have already been minted so you will have to go to the secondhand market if you would like one. **There will only ever be 10,0000 DinoSaviors.**

**What is the gameplay going to consist of?** 

Your Dinos and saviors will have to work together and utilize their unique skills to construct generators for energy and maintain an build their buildings. You will have to embark on escapades to gather resources needed to craft items, build, and upgrade rooms, and feed your dinos.

**How will I be able to earn?** This game will have several avenues for you to earn such as:

**Breeding:** Dinos can breed with Dinos, or a Dino can breed with a savior.

**Breeding Rentals**: You will be able to rent out your Dinos and Saviors to other players for breeding.

**In game rewards**: You can send your Dinos and saviors out on expeditions to earn DinoCoins and other various in game rewards. **These coins will be tradeable on the open market.**

**DinoCoin Drop:** This will give you 750 DC per Dino you own and 500 DC for every savior you own. DinoCoins are required for breeding purposes and is the most valuable reward within the game.

CardanoNFTs,Small artist selling NFT/CNFT's is a good idea?,"Started few months ago on this journey on cryptos and blockchain, had already some knowledge from the years before learning a few things about Bitcoin etcetera, and now invested part of my savings on Cardano cause I believe a lot in this project, and sideways was trying to learn more about NFT's and CNFT's. I understood almost everything and had an idea. 

My wife is an amazing artist (hand-drawn watercolor, pencil drawing, professional tattoo artist and she create some digital arts too), she has a bunch of arts hand-drawn arts that is stored and with no use, but they are not ""connected"" or have similar traits between each other. 

Does anyone think it's a good idea digitizing these pieces, minting them and showing the world?

The process, would we need to create some kind of background first for connecting with people?

Searching for small artists that publish NFT's or CNFT's, couldn't find much about.  Sorry if my question is too dumb, but since Cardano community seems like comprehensive, I'd like a lot if someone points me and my wife some ways or give us some tips!

CardanoNFTs,"Artano (late) June update: Website, Artamint, The [A] Auction","This is the Artano team, coming with an exciting (and a bit late) monthly update! This month we were focusing on Artamint’s development and created the first minting service that will have the lowest possible cost for the first two weeks!  


* **Artamint - the most affordable CNFT minting service is released on July 1!** We’re excited to share that our affordable minting service has been released this week! We hope people will adopt it widely, as the fees are currently \~0.5ADA per mint for the first two weeks. Afterwards, we’ll take an additional 1ADA (\~1.5ADA in total) to cover the server expenses. Of course, the “dust” fees are variable over time, and might be slightly lower or higher depending on the strain on the network.
* **The website is out:** we’ve officially released our page with information about our mission, who we are as a team, and where we want to take Artano as a Cardano NFT marketplace. We’re always looking at Cardano’s core values, cooperation, sustainability and inclusivity, and we strongly believe that sharing these values at Artano will help us do the right thing for all CNFT marketplaces. We want to deliver a solution where people will know exactly what they’re selling when selling an NFT and make it easier for people to find the NFTs they’re interested in.
* **First auction, the \[A\] auction, is looking amazing!** We’ve received all of the pieces for the first collection and we must share how excited we are for the upcoming auction in July! We have **fifteen** artists and **three** curators from **fourteen countries** who have been involved in the \[A\] collection, from indiginous communities in the Philippines and India, to artists in the heart of France and LA. Six continents represented and a truly global crowd! All the pieces will change with different time intervals, and some will take months before you truly see what the piece looks like in it’s full shape and form!

CardanoNFTs,The explosive growth of LovelaceMarketplace.io caught us by surprise,"We knew that a self service NFT Marketplace would be of value to the community.  But we honestly didnt expect it to have gotten so much use, in such a short period of time.  There is no longer a need to post your NFT's, and then wait at your computer for an instant response.  You can just post it, and walk away.  If someone is interested, they can either contact you with the built in mail system, or you can leave more detailed contact info on your listing.  Want to do an auction?; thats no problem, you can do that as well.   All listings are searchable.  Under the category view, including the ""All Categories"" view, you can filter by listing type, and price.  Gone are the days that your listing disappears in to the mix of every other post thats ever existed.  


We've listened to the suggestions of the community, and made adjustments here and there.  If there are things you'd like to see, please give us a shout.  All new accounts get 25 free listings.  But if you need more, shoot us a message, and we'll get you what you need.  Since demand had a rapid increase in the last few days, we've already made back end changes to scale with the growth.  Should be a nice smooth experience.",nn5mcx,2021-05-28 19:31:09,Huth_S0lo,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/nn5mcx/the_explosive_growth_of_lovelacemarketplaceio/,9,0,5,9,0,nn5mcx,post

I just got my first set of NFTs ever and I'm happy to announce they are on Cardano.  
Unfortunately I spent half my ADA on them, but that's ok. I will get more in time.

I'm starting to get why NFTs are so popular. 

They are called Jolly Rogers, they have just gone on sale so you can find them here if you are keen:[https://www.nftcrewlab.io](https://www.nftcrewlab.io/)

I think they look pretty tight to be honest. I'm pretty keen to score some space buds, once I have some funds. However, these guys are keeping content until then.

CardanoNFTs,,"Ya, kinda. It's hard to resell an NFT on a marketplace because it means transferring it to another wallet on the marketplace without assurance that it won't be stolen, etc. Without contracts, it's hard to make a real marketplace. 

Plenty of people can create and sell NFTs by managing their own system, but the buyer still has to trust that the seller will send them the NFT after sending ADA. 

Once contracts are in place, it will enable things like auctions, minting/selling a certain inventory, etc. all in a predefined contract. Or simply putting an NFT inside a contract that will only release the NFT to the contract creator or a person that sends in a set price of ADA. All that stuff in contracts is needed to make secure marketplaces.",gwui06x,2021-05-03 23:59:09,JBarCode,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/n4aw09/will_we_have_to_wait_until_the_next_update_for_a/gwui06x/,4,0,,4,0,n4aw09,comment

CardanoNFTs,The Novellia Token Standard (for metadata),"**Get ready to take back gaming!**

The  Novellia Platform is a decentralized game marketplace, built on   blockchain technology, ultimately reducing fees for everyone, and   preventing censorship.

As a first  slice in our initiative, we introduce our own metadata standard we feel  will better serve the needs of the Novellia marketplace. Feedback is  highly welcome. If our format is widely  adopted, we expect this to help  the Cardano token ecosystem while also ensuring our own tokens are  interoperable with as many clients as  possible.

**Why do we need a new token standard?**

* The  existing 721 standard doesn't support more than one image, or different  MIME types. The Novellia standard supports arbitrarily many resources,  redundant URLs, and on-chain hashes to verify integrity of centralized  storage.
* 721  doesn't support level of detail (LOD) for a single resource. Your 30MB  4K illustration either loads or it doesn't. The Novellia standard allows  creating a priority sequence for a single **resource\_id**, so you can load a thumbnail first.
* 721  doesn't give a standard way of extending it. If everyone makes their  own extensions, at the least, clients should have a common way of  telling what they're looking at. The Novellia standard supports a list  of strings to indicate extension. It defines the **novellia\_1** extension.
* Backed  by Rektangular Studios. We need this for certain aspects of Novellia  which are under development. 721 doesn't cut it. You can expect  utilities to be added to our Novellia SDK in the future to help clients  understand Novellia Standard Tokens with a very low barrier to entry.

**Read the detailed specification!**

CardanoNFTs,,"Curious, do u think these Cardano bits will have any value? Now or in the long term? And where do u see the value in these things? 

I’m skeptical. 

I think, the Cardanobit people are sort of confidence men that take advantage of FOMO and so they created a crypto punk clone and made close to a million dollars selling them. I could whip something up like this within a few short weeks (that’s only because of the learning curve) but I would hate to put shit out there just because people will FOMO into it rather then for its creativity.",gui6ztd,2021-04-14 16:43:27,Avi-47,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mqsra7/cbits_5313_the_creatorbased_bit_lol/gui6ztd/,3,0,,3,0,mqsra7,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"English is perfectly fine :-) 

And hmmm, so one use case is others will value it in the future, as it is one of the new projects (although, not original and more of a copy cat IMO)  on Cardano. It has some historical meaning. Okay. 

Am curious, any other reason U bought them? I legitimately am trying to understand  where value in this comes from. I get it’s fun and new to play with (maybe that’s enough) but other then the stated stuff above. I don’t get it and see these guys as con men.

CardanoNFTs,,"I wouldnt say copy cat of crypto punks, but def inspired by them. punks are just a head, and this is kinda designed differently with more of the body too. Their current value is mostly speculative, also being one of the first NFT projects on Cardano. punks when launched were not nearly as popular as they are now, and the more time passes and bits get traded the more value they will accrue as well. There is also the collectible value, where each one is unique with different rarities and attributes. In a few years, they will be worth much more than now, because they will always remain the same 10,000 cardano bits ever created.",gujql9n,2021-04-14 23:48:41,miharbidaddah,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mqsra7/cbits_5313_the_creatorbased_bit_lol/gujql9n/,3,0,,3,0,mqsra7,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"“mostly speculative” - I think u hit it on the nail there. 

On the collectible and rarity aspect. Sure, okay, I can see vague value in that but what happens if I create a clone and expand on the CryptoPunk / Cardanobits? What happen then? 

I’m curious, I’m thinking I will actually create a similar nfts and expand some things on the current design and sell it for at cost(pennies) or low price say 5 or 2 Ada each (so everyone can afford and play with it), and put a randomized winners (not the price range bullshit they did). I want it to follow the Cardano ethos (accessible and open). I wonder what happens then? 
- in fact, what I would like to do is, create a unique nft for everyone who wants to participate. It will be a one time thing but everyone will have a unique nft. This way it will benefit the whole community and whomever participates. 

Would u be interested? I’m thinking of getting my artist/programmer friend get in on it.",guk26w6,2021-04-15 01:28:49,Avi-47,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mqsra7/cbits_5313_the_creatorbased_bit_lol/guk26w6/,1,0,,1,0,mqsra7,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"The dirty truth is I own Cardanobits lol, I wanted to see what the hype was (also speculated) and once I researched the profit margin, the unequal and bs Ada ranges they did. I don’t see it as more then a cash grab in a big way. 

I’m thinking of creating a similar crypto punk / Cardanobits clone and I will distribute it at cost (pennies) or for free depending on cost.

CardanoNFTs,,"if someone just created another cardano bits, they can, but most probably people wont buy them. Just like anyone could create a new crypto punks collection, but that doesnt mean people will pay for it. there is value in being the first mover in the NFT space, and there is value in being unique, and there is value in having a cool artwork. if you blatantly copy it, your project will be known as just that.

there is another project called cardano kings, also 8bit style but just the heads. some people bought them, me personally i was not interested at all. i ddnt even like the art. you need to also consider that NFTs are already saturating the market. after the success of spacebudz, many are rushing to create their own. and some will flop. Cardano bits success is not to be scoffed at. their second sale of 1600 bits sold in less than 5 min. that is one heck of a demand. other projects are having 3-4 days presales and not selling out.

There are a few roads you can go. spacebudz and cardano bits and also coming soon (cryptoknitties) use a computer algorithm to mix the designs they created. so they just create x number of each accessory or race or gadget, then the algorithm creates the characters mixing the x number of accessories randomly together.

Or you can design every single design uniquely by hand. (this will cost a lot more in terms of time and effort) but it will be valued more

Some projects like fingermonsters ""complete flop"" create 5-10-20 whatever designs and print each one like 100 times. i absolutely wont put a dime in such projects. they totally missed the point of an NFT being unique. i bet those projects lose value instantly because u get many people selling the same NFT on the market which quickly dries up the demand bringing the price crashing down.

i would def be interested and i was working on an strategy game with NFT characters but we ddnt really find dev help for the game dev side so we might start with just the NFT characters and see where we get from there.",guk61jg,2021-04-15 02:02:01,miharbidaddah,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mqsra7/cbits_5313_the_creatorbased_bit_lol/guk61jg/,2,0,,2,0,mqsra7,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"The event is launching February 21, 2022 during London Fashion Week.

Viktoria Modesta is a bionic pop artist, entrepreneur, and creative director. Originally from post-USSR Latvia, Viktoria's formative period was spent living in England, drawing inspiration and spirit from the avant-garde subculture, music and art scenes of London. Currently living in Los Angeles she has established herself as a recording artist and a leader, connector and innovator in the post-disability community, bridging pop culture and art with academia, medicine and brands in hyper collaborative multi­media productions.

Viktoria first stepped onto the global stage with her perennially viral music/art video Prototype. Tallying hundreds of million views across the internet & television, her arres­ting post-disability design and sound introduced Viktoria as the world's first Bionic Pop Artist. She is most known for her hyper-stylized performances across the globe, such as the closing ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics, Miami Art Basel or her a sold-out re­sidency at the iconic Crazy Horse Paris cabaret, constantly pushing art and inclusivity forward in entertainment.

An MIT Media Lab Fellow of 6 years and a member of the Young European Leaders program, Viktoria continuously explores the impact of technology and inclusive design on the future of human lifestyle and culture. Her life story has been recognized around the world as a testament of human strength and a transformative approach to modern identity: Barack Obama chose Viktoria to profile for his guest-edited WIRED magazine issue, and she has recently been selected as an ambassador and space trainee the first ever inclusive space program 'Mission Astro Access'.

She has become a household name amongst the digital renaissance of futurist artists -working across crypto art, digital fashion and virtual identity. Her latest artwork star­ring her virtual alter-ego is featured in TIME magazine's TIMEpieces NFT drop.",hwydo6f,2022-02-14 20:57:53,artanoio,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ssl5wb/as_part_of_our_fashion_world_debut_were_excited/hwydo6f/,2,0,,2,0,ssl5wb,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"You will earn additional NFTs (loot,bonuses, etc.) by completing quests.  
 Basically, the game is a mix of resource management with rpg questing.   
You own a tavern (no cost to own a tavern) and   
your tavern can be enhanced with furniture and pixel characters(bars,   
tables, bar maids, inn keepers etc.) The better your tavern, the better   
the quests available to your adventurers. You will have either regular   
adventurers (which can die on quests) or have a GMA (Grandmaster   
Adventurer) which cannot die on quests - Your adventurers complete   
quests(teams of 5)to gain resources for your tavern. Your team can   
consist of regular pixel characters, gma's, or a combo of both. A   
starter pack will be provided to all who want to play. You will also be   
encouraged to trade supplies with other tavern owners, creating an   
in-game economy.

CardanoNFTs,"I'm an artist, new to the NFT space, with a few questions for the Community (Investors and Creators)","Hi everyone! Let me start by saying that I'm not here to sell anything (I have yet to start my NFT journey)... Though I am not new to crypto in general, I just started getting into NFT's recently. I really like the Cardano Chain but I had a few questions as a creator and as an investor and I was hoping to gain some insight from the community! 

\-First, there are a ton of marketplaces... how do you choose? Are there ones you trust more than others as an investor or creator?

\-I see independent artists selling off their own site, is that something people like? I kind of like having my own space for what I do, but at the same time would a creator lose exposure by not being on a big marketplace, or would they just get lost in everything?

\-Do you actively follow artists? and what social media is preferred in the community?

\-How do people feel about music in the NFT Space? I've heard a lot of mixed input around this. I think it would be really fun to write one of a kind songs for people accompanied with an image (if that's possible... i'm not actually sure if you can do that)

\-For creators, where do you trust to host your work?

\-As investors, what do you think is a fair starting price for work for a new creator in the scene? (art and or music)

Any other advice for this novice?

&#x200B;

I really appreciate anyone who took even a moment to answer just one of these questions. This space seems really fun and as a musician, i think there could be some really cool things that could come out of it.",r6z1ju,2021-12-02 04:43:25,SickCityNFT,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/r6z1ju/im_an_artist_new_to_the_nft_space_with_a_few/,7,0,4,7,0,r6z1ju,post

CardanoNFTs,,"Trying to make it in the NFT Art space is quite similar to real life. Without any marketing and connections, nobody notices you at first.

I started [my own project](https://twitter.com/TheCardanoVerse) a few months ago, but I was never noticed since I don't have the budget to do marketing myself. I'm still drawing my art pieces to go into my collection. I list my NFTs on [Tokhun.io](https://Tokhun.io). Currently I have no plans to mint more since I'm struggling financially.

I'm happy to collaborate with anybody, but I'm quite busy as a senior in college so small time is all I can do!

Most NFT projects have rarity elements to them so you never know what you're going to 'pull' when you buy one.

CardanoNFTs,,">In the days of Yore, there was naught, but a sable wisp; a thought. A concept that even as an omniscient power, the singular cosmos still yearns for the gift of discovery. Thus Enkos, Great Phantasm of the Abyss, manifested itself; taking a form beyond our comprehension. It has taken its place among the Deep,  beyond the Chthonic Shores, where It lies dreaming of what has yet to be revealed. 

  
The world of Covenaunt displays a reality where the waking dreams of cosmic emanations define the laws of the universe, leaving room for acausal beings and magic to take deep root in the foundation of intelligent life.   
  
Where in our reality, we as a species inhabit one planet among billions, within the world of covenaunt various species inhabit planes of reality called Great Dreams. Each dream is indirectly governed by an emanation, a manifestation of the cosmos attempting to stabilize primordial chaos. Over time the emanations developed unique personalities and begame to operate with a level of autonomy. So much so that certain cultures began to revere them in the aspect of gods assigning them names and spheres of influence.  
  
While there are a near infinite amount of dreams, the most dominant within Covenaunt are The Abyss, Aether, and Irminsul. Within these dreams is a plethora of diverse cultures such as the Tedraumuir, the Duender, Humans, Ovates, druden, and the Besmirched.

Sadly teh\_mooses isnt an active member of the Cardano Community, and is blissfully unaware of the bad press from Coco Loco, and a few other happenings this week.  So you can rest easy knowing both of these projects are very much real.  Lords is slated to drop on the 18th.  And I've been working away this weekend to make the preparations for KMFDM.  I should have a launch date this coming week for their NFT's.

CardanoNFTs,,"From Yellow Pages:

$CNFT Utility Token

With the CNFT.IO VI platform now live you can acquire some early access $CNFT utility tokens.

As our token platform is already live this is not an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). It is an early bird
opportunity to acquire some utility tokens for a limited time only. The additional cashflow will
allow the CNFT team expand more rapidly. You asked and we have listened.

Most importantly, these tokens are not being marketed or sold as specific investments or a
security token. As such they do not confer any shareholder or other related rights upon the
holders, now or at any time in the future. Holders do not acquire any part of the CNFT.IO
platform, it's current or future profits.

2 | $CNFT YELLOWPAPER

CNFT.IO

As the platform grows our CNFT utility tokens can be used for early access to NFT sales on

the upcoming launchpad and to secure other giveaways. Cool stuff like that. There is lots
planned, which cannot all be revealed at this time.

You should only acquire our tokens to access the holders benefits and not for any possible,
future speculative gain. We remind you that cryptocurrency is extremely volatile.

The best way to think of these tokens is like the tickets from the arcade when you were a kid.
Some will be airdropped to regular users of the platform, we may run competitions where
the winner is paid with a 'jackpot' of CNFT tokens.

Trading of our tokens may very well be possible on the secondary Cardano markets (including
DEXS) but we cannot offer any on-site exchange services at this time, save for exchanging our
tokens for early access and unique digital artwork. As such we cannot guarantee the future
value of our tokens. However, our team have open dialog with some of the first DEX's coming
to Cardano with regards to liquidity. Perhaps there may even be a CNFT DEX?",hbrjkaa,2021-09-06 02:58:47,Buying-your-dips,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/peqaby/cnft_token_any_thoughts/hbrjkaa/,2,0,,2,0,peqaby,comment

CardanoNFTs,,"Altho the tokenomics are not so clear, i would compare it the RARI token to have a point of refenece to see if the price they're asking is high or low.  


So if you compare to RARI, and consider a similar marketcap of $65.000.000, but consider a circulating supply of 6billion (as indicated on yellow paper for the actual pre-sale), then you get that 1 $CNFT = $0.01 USD, which is aprox the price they're asking on their Betadex (1 ADA = 200 $cnft). With this comparison I assume that it is some kind of high. 

If the 6billion are sold, then they would raised 65 million dollars... i believe that's a little too much to develop the platform, what do you think?

If one expect some kind of ROI, I believe it would be wiser to wait until it we have more clarity on the utility on the token, aswell as circulating supply, marketcap, vesting schedule, etc.",held57c,2021-09-28 13:31:48,SLSYC,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/peqaby/cnft_token_any_thoughts/held57c/,1,0,,1,0,peqaby,comment

If you divide the total RARI in circulation into 6Bil you get 1164.  Divide the current RARI price of $18.36 by 1164 and you get 0.01577.  Based on ADAs price today 2.18  equalling 1 ADA to 200 CNFT you are paying 0.0109. Do with that info what you will.

CardanoNFTs,,"CardanoTrees are minted fully on-chain and they are not a gif, image, or video. 

They evolve slowly in real time, and they mimic the season of the country they're from.

The trees background, lighting, weather, and growth patterns change in real time depending on their country of origin (so if you live in America and get a Tree from China, it will be darker with a black background during the Daytime in the United States since it's night time in China)

It was minted 4 days ago and it's in the top 3 CNFT's by volume.

Winner will be chosen Sep. 5 at 11AM PST

CardanoNFTs,Issue buying asset on CNFT using yoroi wallet,I went to purchase my second asset this week. As I sent my coin to the address on the transaction. The ticker never switch from send Ada to the seller sending the asset. The ticker expired and so did the transaction. On the transaction page CNFT states if the timer expires your coin will be refunded. Any one know how long that might take? Also the asset I went to purchase has disappeared from the selling page. Does that mean the owner has to relist it?,payyfq,2021-08-24 23:26:21,zschmitty112,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/payyfq/issue_buying_asset_on_cnft_using_yoroi_wallet/,8,0,21,8,0,payyfq,post

CardanoNFTs,Ponchos - 1987 collectibles with a twist | A treasure of 5449₳ is hidden inside,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zcnik5vilie71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fea93e09094b26db4219cb0e2a24d438076ce38

The collection contains clues that lead to 7 wallets holding a total of **5449₳**.

We've used simple steganography, encryption and various ciphers to hide all the information needed to claim the bounty.

**How much does a Poncho cost ?**

||Regular TX|TX with metadata|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Poncho|55₳|44₳|
|3 Ponchos|144₳|111₳|

You can also get free ponchos if you have a Redeemable token. 171/1987 ponchos are reserved and can only be minted with a Redeemable token.

&#x200B;

**How can I get a Redeemable token ?**

[The 4 types of Redeemable tokens](https://preview.redd.it/yvvrpb2j5ie71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff7f890c0e230b63aeee7d9d4a796be53d79454)

Our sale system will give out a total of 37 x GoodFor1 and 37 x GoodFor3 tokens. You won't receive it in your wallet directly *(that would be too easy)*. Instead the Weaver will attach an encrypted message (PGP symmetric AES256) to the mint transaction, and show you the password on the website. Using this information and our Decryption tool, you will discover the seed words for a wallet containing the redeemable tokens.

[This is how you'll know you've received a redeemable token](https://preview.redd.it/y3c00nu26ie71.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f540b078437f52f9748296b307632bbba7de80)

&#x200B;

**Do I need to own a poncho to be able to claim a treasure wallet ?**

No, once a poncho is minted all the information is accessible to anyone. All you need is an eye for detail and good Google-fu.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I first purchased [https://unsigs.com](https://unsigs.com) my first few compositions where basically, find the matching pieces, then it went to compositions using multiple unsigs using depth, perspective and color matching. I have finally migrated on to Blender 2.9 and am doing solar systems and randomized rotation machines with light and motion to generate end compositions.  For my solar systems I look at  unsig properties and from there  I may add rings, moons or other features, but the point being is that with this project your imagination is your only limit.  I also really like how the developers Alex and Patrick support and encourage unsig holders to take them to the next level. 20858 out of 31117 sold in less than 2 months is pretty nice as well. I encourage you to have a look , but careful they are quite addictive.

CardanoNFTs,,"Sale Details:
Each NFT is worth 52 ADA.
Since I don’t have any fancy randomly generation program that automatically sends NFTs when you send a wallet a certain amount of ADA, I am going to use a randomization function from google sheets to randomize the names of all of our applications. I will go down the list of applicants and personally DM them through Discord. From there, I will randomize all of the available tokens and you will receive a random artwork in the collection. I will also ask you if you would like to purchase another one, and if yes, I will write your name down on another list for later. After each transaction, I will remove the sold NFT from the list and randomize again. After the first run through all of the applicants, I will repeat the process with the list of people who wish to buy again, asking them if they want to keep buying, and creating a new list until there are 1) no more buyers or 2) no more art pieces remaining. If there are no more buyers by the time I finish running through all of the applicants, the sale will continue on a first-come, first-serve basis.",gy3n7cp,2021-05-14 14:05:09,everyonesmilenow,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/nc9cp1/new_project_i_think_you_will_love/gy3n7cp/,3,0,,3,0,nc9cp1,comment

This is honestly the kindest, genuine community out of all the crypto communities I follow. I support the sustainable architecture Cardano has built in the crypto world and I am excited to adopt Cardano to mint my NFTs.

I’ve been working hard to get my first collection “WE THE PEOPLE” on its feet and and proud to say that it will be available May 14th 6pm EST With this project, I wanted to make a virtual representation of every day people like you in a dystopian future. “We The People” is a collection of unique characters, all hand-drawn, depicting different people, animals, or robots. All hand drawn by me so each one is unique! No computer generated NFTs here. Every collection released will have its own color scheme which includes 16 unique characters to collect. I include many influences from my early childhood and try to weave them into a futuristic universe. I’m so excited to be a part of this community and grow along with it!

Great tool you have going on. However, just a few questions questions.

1. Whats the purchasing mechanism like? I can't seem to find a ""buy"" button anywhere. Looks like on one of the pieces, the person's twitter handle is included, does this mean P2P sales?
2. It looks like only one NFT can be minted at a time, so they will all have different policy IDs. Any plans to allow people to mint multiple under the same policy?
2. How are keys going to be handled? How should an artist using your service be confident that you aren't going to mint another 10000 NFTs with the same policy?",gwnb0o8,2021-05-02 11:06:17,rlylikesomelettes,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/n30uoh/nft_market_is_out_and_nft_maker_in_one/gwnb0o8/,1,0,,1,0,n30uoh,comment

CardanoNFTs,What is the best CNFT project for you?,"Here we are after a few months with several NFT projects on the cardan network, and it is important to remember that this is all happening well ahead of expectations, many projects already launched,  others soon to be launched and I would like to know, which projects did you like the most? which ones did you buy and bought and which ones do you think about buying?

For me there were several who saw the project and it caught my attention, some are:
- CardanoBits, first I participated, I still think it has potential, but the creators have to provide that
- Spacebudz, there's no way to talk, unfortunately I couldn't buy one at launch, that's when I started to know the beauty of NFTs, but it's amazing what this project has done for the entire ecosystem of cardano NFTs
- Madinart, I am more than happy to say, if everything goes well, I was one of the lucky ones who managed to buy Kobe24 art, for me it is simply a beautiful surreal art and even more it has a sentimental touch, i am a basketball fan and i know the importance of kobe bryant and getting this art from him serves me as a memory of the great player and the great human being he was
- Yasen, I don’t have much to say about Yasen’s arts, because it’s an art that’s not meant to be spoken, but felt, it’s necessary for everyone to see them by themselves and appreciate their beauties, simply a true artist
 
Some projects that I'm not going to talk about much, but I'm looking forward to seeing them and getting mine:
- Knitties
- Crew NFT
- Cardano Warriors (OMFG I WANT THEY SO MUCH)

and some others....

NFTs are created on the blockchain and represent something unique, such as a painting or a house. The token represents ownership of that asset, and this data and ownership is cemented in a block on the blockchain. They can also incorporate a smart contract that pays the creator a portion of money each time the asset and token are sold.",mtxbay,2021-04-19 10:01:10,thumbsdrivesmecrazy,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Art'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/mtxbay/how_nfts_are_fueling_the_modern_art_world/,7,0,0,7,0,mtxbay,post
CardanoNFTs,🧪🐌 «CryptoSLUGs» ☠️☢️ NFT Card Game,"Following ""do-in-one-night"" concept I've created a Cardano NFT Card Game.

[https://ne0.xyz/cryptoslugs/](https://ne0.xyz/cryptoslugs/)

The brand-new idea is that you can mint NFT's for the game your own!

You can mint your own «CryptoSLUG» with any policy and metadata. The only requirement is that it's ASCII name is ""CRYPTOSLUG"". You should get something like asset1cujl4j7ndr9hvhuymvfhs70eet48qxwud7ejmq; ASCII:CRYPTOSLUG. Than you just see what random assen name were generated and paste it on this page to see what random properties your CryptoSLUG got in a proccess of minting. You can add an image of your SLUG to metadata so it would be even more fun.

Following Game mechanics are very simple:

1. Which CryptoSLUG has longer tintacles, it attacks first.
2. If Appetite of Attacker is more than Weight of Victim it consumes the Victim and Wins.
3. In other Case Victim tries to consume Attacker with the same Appetite > Weight Condition.
4. If Attackers Radula < Victim Notum, appetite of attacker deduces ""Radula - Notum"" and vice versa
5. If Attacker Omnivorus < Victim Toxicity, appetite of Attacker deduces ""Toxicity - Omnivorouse"" and vice versa

When one CryptoSLUG wins by the above rules the Foot Fringe of Attaker compares with Victim, and if the Victims Foot Fringe is longer than it ""runs"" away and it's draw. In other case it's a TOTAL WIN and Winner takes the CryptoSLUG of the competitor.

UP.

I did the 1:1 Battle page:

[https://ne0.xyz/cryptoslugs/battle/](https://ne0.xyz/cryptoslugs/battle/)

What is working:

1. SLUG #1 and SLUG #2 Properties are being calculated from respective asset names
2. Sample Battle mechanic with default asset
3. Battle mechanic for all possible cases. Badly need to test!

~~What is not working:~~

1. ~~Battle mechanic for all possible cases. Stil working on it.~~

First one did their own CRYPTOSLUG. Just take a look what awesome powers it got by a small chance:

CardanoNFTs,,"There’s no such thing as a noob question here! We’re all learning and helping each other that’s what this community is about! So in terms of the steps, there are a few projects looking to provide this (check the pinned tab on the home of this subreddit for a breakdown of these - Lovada are one of them). We’re hoping to release a platform dedicated to artists who know nothing about NFTs to get them involved, and allow a place for collectors to discover and buy their work. We’re not far off having a really simple app to allow users to mint tokens and link them with digital pieces, however the challenge with many is not so much the minting, but the building of a marketplace. 

We’ve minted some tokens already that can be sent around between wallets, but the trading, advertising, and sales pieces are where the complexities come in - which is why there are several projects hoping to do this in different degrees for different use-cases.

CardanoNFTs,,"No worries! For the sake of the NFTs, artists will need to provide a sample (ideally low quality to minimise the risk of people stealing the samples and trying to mint as original items), and a link to the unlocked high quality item for the winner to download. Currently we won’t have a market ready in time for march 1st - at least not for the public sadly. But we’re working hard at getting a minimal viable product ready for shortly after that date. 

We’re also building a fee model that means we would only take a very small portion of sales over a certain amount. These figures aren’t finalized yet, but for example, sales up to 1000 ADA will only cost gas, and any sales that go for more than 1000 ADA we will take a 5% cut on the transaction cost plus gas, just to keep the platform sustainable. When the secondary market is ready we also want to make it artist centric so artists will always make a fixed amount of royalties which will be at least equivalent to what the reseller makes. This is due to the fact we feel resellers on other markets are making 10x profits on artwork they didn’t create, and the artists only see a tiny chunk of these profits, if any.",golg4ue,2021-02-24 16:14:46,lovada-art,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/lr8wct/creating_a_selfserved_nft_minting_dapp/golg4ue/,5,0,,5,0,lr8wct,comment

CardanoNFTs,Joey's Hot Sauce: Dual Token + World Class Hot Sauce + Regenerative Farming + Documentary + National Geographic + Netflix,"Hi Everyone!

I'm excited to share this Joey's Hot Sauce NFT with you. Details are here [https://nft.joeyshotsauce.com/](https://nft.joeyshotsauce.com/) and the Policy Id is af5a67065fffc513a60d12b8a9bcd59fe03f184191b84c809ae0efb2

**What's included:**

1. A 1/150 token like this (for individual bottles): [https://pool.pm/af5a67065fffc513a60d12b8a9bcd59fe03f184191b84c809ae0efb2.priscillathecreeper](https://pool.pm/af5a67065fffc513a60d12b8a9bcd59fe03f184191b84c809ae0efb2.priscillathecreeper), or a 1/100 token like this (for box sets): [https://pool.pm/af5a67065fffc513a60d12b8a9bcd59fe03f184191b84c809ae0efb2.getonthesauce](https://pool.pm/af5a67065fffc513a60d12b8a9bcd59fe03f184191b84c809ae0efb2.getonthesauce)
2. A 1/1 numbered image from our documentary: [Hot Sauce, Wildfires & Ada](https://nft.joeyshotsauce.com/documentary), which was produced by a team of filmmakers who met at National Geographic
3. A real bottle of hot sauce (or box of 4) shipped to you (with a serial number to match your image NFT + featuring a Cardano logo)
4. A donation to [Fire & Salt Regenerative Beef Co.](https://www.fireandsalt.com/)

**So why did we build this?**

We believe that Cardano NFTs open a new world of opportunities for small businesses to solve real problems, and to form new collaborations. We believe that by doing so, we open new opportunities to light up people's imaginations. For example - this project brought together Joey's Hot Sauce, Gimbalabs, Fire & Salt Regenerative Beef, and a team of filmmakers. But the story didn't stop there: all of these partnerships are leading to new collaborations. Hobbs from Fire & Salt is now collaborating with [Cardano4Climate](https://cardano4climate.com/). Mike, our filmmaker from National Geographic (and who has been contributing to the story featured on the [cover of the latest issue](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/a-divers-hunt-for-lost-slave-ships-led-to-an-incredible-journey)) is spreading the word to many of the world's most influential wildlife photographers, and Joey was the guy who made the initial connection between [Mandala](https://www.enterthemandala.io/) and people working in the Cardano ecosystem.

In short, we recognize that hot sauce alone isn't going to change the world -- but when we start from cases like this, well, things can really heat up!

Every bottle features a Cardano logo and can't be purchased anywhere else. This is a very unique batch of sauce, featuring a batch of scotch bonnet peppers that give the sauce a special flair. Imagine yourself sitting around the table, wondering how to start ""that crypto conversation"" with your friends and family, and having a prop like hot sauce to get the conversation going!

**And for all you degens out there...**

There's one more thing we want you to know. There's a new documentary coming out on Netflix in March called Bad Vegan ([https://youtu.be/4nTf7iViYUI](https://youtu.be/4nTf7iViYUI)). It's from the same team that made Fyre and Tiger King - in other words, these are people who make stories go viral. And we've been told by the production team that Joey is going to come across as a fan favorite...but don't take my word for it, check out that trailer, he's got the best line in the whole thing!

So here we've got 700 first edition NFTs from a project that's going to catching a lot more attention really soon...I'll let you decide if this is exciting :)

**What can you do?**

Of course, we hope you'll consider picking up a Joey's First Edition NFT - and if anyone wants to bring Joey on a podcast or show before/after the Netflix doc drops in March, let us know!

Moving forward, if you find any of this inspiring, this is just one example of how we're building bridges to the real world at Gimbalabs -- here's to the journey, and we hope you'll come say hi any time!

Cheers,

James",t26jv2,2022-02-26 20:41:08,workshop_maybe,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Upcoming Drops'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/t26jv2/joeys_hot_sauce_dual_token_world_class_hot_sauce/,7,0,0,7,0,t26jv2,post

GeroWallet Stag

36.1k Twitter. Gerowallet has been a growing popular blockchain-agnostic wallet since summer 2021. In that time it has solidified itself as a crucial tool in the growing DeFi space. The DeFi users can often switch between Cardano, Ethereum Polkadot and Solana seamlessly due to GeroWallet's features. A part of the roadmap is the easy bridging of $GERO Cardano native tokens and $GERO ERC-20 tokens. This drop, specifically is a bit of an unknown though. According to the GERO team their goal is to celebrate the state of the wallet by releasing 2000 GeroWallet Stag inspired CNFTs. These will be available at their site at 35 ADA for one, 99 ADA for 3, or 160 ADA for 5. A ranking on this one is difficult because most people do not have an affinity to a specific wallet and, currently, other than a potential Mecha stag, there isn't a clear value or reason to participate in this mint. I'm tempted to Red Flag it because I don't envision there being much skin on the bone, even if you do grab a few but because the loyalty to the GeroWallet is pretty high and the 36k Twitter following is no small amount, I will stick it a Neutral project.

Anatomy NFT

^(5ede4e90761dbd0a2f6b2025086b43f7d0f440dbe3c8f224d5b8e396)

2.9k/3.7k Twitter/Discord. The Discord activity for the size seems to be pretty in line with others. There is a 400 user whitelist that is filled. Total supply is 4000 at a a cost of 39 ADA and TX cap of 3 per. Roadmap plans include future 3D animated airdrops, royalty distribution to holders, and a mini-DAO for treasury investment decisions. The art work is a bit meh for some of them but the lower supply and cheaper price, should drive some activity into the mint. I don't think they will hold the floor value for very long but will likely pop off early and fizzle out quick. So if you can grab at mint, you might be able to flip some gains if you are quick. I would say high Neutral though because longevity on that value is going to be a hard bargain.",sy4ulh,2022-02-21 21:22:09,gafgarian,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Upcoming Drops'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/sy4ulh/scheduled_cnft_mints_223/,6,0,2,6,0,sy4ulh,post

“We are equally excited to be aligned closely with Cardano and love their incisive vision and can-do attitude. We are working through the Cardano integration, had to solve some interesting tech issues, and have managed to code up some Cardano firsts! The integration is mostly there — we are working through secondary sales scenarios now. As soon as complete — we can mint the Cardano summit NFTs and support Cardano for any new brands or IP sets.”

CardanoNFTs,How to start NFT collection,"Hi guys, so as the title says i'm trying to start a CNFT but I have multiple questions regarding the selling of the NFTs.

1. Do I mint the NFT and then send it to the address of the buyer? Or do I send the .jpeg and they mint it?

2)Any youtube videos that you recommend me for watching on the process to sell them.

3)Platform you recommend for selling.

CardanoNFTs,,"Hi u/Fricstoks

You should try Minterr.io  (Minterr)- I managed to mint 30 Cardano NFTs for around 1.7 ADA. If you look under the below wallet address you will see 33 NFTs in total - 3 in my first use and 30 NFTs in Test 2 - which consists of 27 PNGs and 3 Gifs - they are labelled as TEST2. I created these to test out the Minterr site.

My address if you want to see my Minterr test NFTs (use [Pool.pm](https://Pool.pm) and paste in the address): addr1q9ad4amgd4uzcd9g3vplmvzwtdxgufjd8s2t2vtl860u3wyqpndaqtgr596w42sjfnyq2yfljk5szdke6u60dtzhurusfku8kj

**NB** \- I have created a guide for myself (share it with the support team on Minterr discord also) - I can email you if you like.

**NB2** \- I am not affiliated or employed by Minterr in any way (before anyone suggests this). I'm I am looking to create a few small one-off collections - one being around 100 NFTs - and I have done a bit of testing with a few Cardano NFT creating sites. I am not a coder - more of a creator of content/artist if you would. I needed to find a website that allowed me to mint NFTs, ideally multiple NFTS on the same contract (and maybe multiple copies of the same NFT), and for a reasonable cost.

What I like about [Minterr](https://Minterr.io) is the following:

\- It's easy to understand - the amateur user can pick up the basics straight away (although doing some testing on this and other sites has helped me learn a bit more about the functionality).

\- You can use the same policy as much as you want to create a collection as big as you want with individual NFTs or multiples of NFTs . NB - You have to mint in batches of up to 30 (so say you want 100 images - that's 4 batches: 30 + 30 + 30 + 10 , or say 4 batches of 25 NFTs).

\- You can create (as far as I can tell) unlimited metadata fields.

\- It is cheap. I've minted NFTs in one batch for around 1.3 ADA and the other batch (of 30 NFTS  including some multiples made up of PNGs and Gifs) for around 1.7ADA. This is, in my eyes is very cheap, especially given that when I have tested on other sites the cost has been between 3 and 5 ADA for each individual NFT (and each one has been on a different Policy ID).

Edit: NB - forgot to add the downsides. The Policy ID remains open (but I think the admin can close them for you, I'm waiting to hear back about this but from what I have been told by support this should be possible). This is, like many Cardano projects in the very early stages - so its currently V1, when many UX tweaks (I.e. ability to hide passphrase, tool tips, ability to close Policy ID yourself, etc) need to be added. I have been told many if not all of these will be coming in V2 (towards the end of Q1 2022)

**FYI - Other sites I have used** (and they are good - so I can't knock them) are:

\-  [www.NFT-Maker.io](https://www.NFT-Maker.io) \- (NFT-Maker)I used V1 as I still have to understand 'Pro' version. Plus side - very easy to use, and everything is laid out easy. The downside from what I found was that it was one NFT at a time (although I'm sure PRO version allows more - I just have not figured it out), and that the amount of Metadata I can add is limited to Title/Author/Description/ Website and Arweave address. You cannot create your own fields (or edit the titles of the existing fields). The cost was reasonable - 2 ADA I think it was (3ADA sent and 1 ADA sent back - going off memory).

\- [https://cardano-native-token.com/](https://cardano-native-token.com/) (Cardano-Native-Tokens)- Plus side - again very easy to use, the UX is nicer than others I have used, and everything is laid out easy to understand (basically the website is nice to use). Additionally, you can add metadata fields. The website is developed by one person (I believe) and he will reply when you email him, so the ability to communicate easily with the creator is big plus. The downside: only one NFT at a time, at a cost of 5ADA with the 1ADA sent back I think it was (which considering its a one man/small team - I understand, but it is still expensive), and for now there are no plans to do batch uploads (I did chat to the developer via email, and for now, it is not a priority - but maybe in the future). Additionally, each NFT is done on a new policy - which means creating a collection on the same policy ID, even one by one, is not possible (maybe if you email the developer he will help with this).

\- [https://cardanonftfactory.web.app/](https://cardanonftfactory.web.app/) \- (CardanoNFTFactory) Currently testing on this - will update you when I have anything more to add. From an early look you can create your own metadata and upload multiple files for NFTs in one go. Also - the cost for 1 NFT is 1ADA, and 0.5 ADA per additional NFT - so for my  30 ADA test files - it would cost me 15.5AFA (which is a lot more than the 1.7 ADA it cost on Minterr). Not sure if the Policy ID is reusable. Also - just noticed - there is no 'Ticker' field (a unique name, different to 'Name' that makes the NFT unique) for the NFT creator to label as they want. Maybe this will be possible in any next screen once files to be made into NFTs have been uploaded (and Ticker naming option is in the next step - unless ofcourse it is not - and the website/dev name the Ticker). I'm going to join the discord and find out more - about policy and if there is a batch production option.

Anyway - I hope this helps you, and others (apologies for any spelling mistakes - writing this whilst surrounded by my infant kids).

CardanoNFTs,,"Thank you for the offer, I might just text/message you should I have any questions.

From my quick examination - Minterr does appear to be cheaper though (30 NFTs - consisting of multiple PNG and Gifs) for 1.7 ADA in total (although Cardano NFT Factory is the next cheapest at 0.5 ADA each - others start at 2ADA onwards for a NFT). This could always change in the future. Saying that - I am still happy to test Cardano NFT Factor as I like testing new websites and learning more :)

As all these websites are new - time will tell if any bugs, improvements, changes impact the utility.

CardanoNFTs,,"30 different NFTs - I did 27 different PNGs and 3 different Gifs (and a few of the PNGs and Gifs had different quantities). I am yet to test MP4s and other files - but I think a few different file types are possible. I've only been speaking to the support people on Discord - I am yet to chat to a Dev directly. 

Please don't let this dissuade you from your website and what you are doing - what you are doing is appreciated also and it can hopefully show you all the options you have for a V2 of your website (Minterr is not perfect either, and I have pointed this out to them - but like you, they have planned improvements and learning which is why I like and speak about them positively).

CardanoNFTs,,"I'm not really sure exactly what I am expecting as a tip, I guess I am wondering if you have noticed any bugs, idiosyncracies, any limitations etc. I think one of the points you - or someone else mentioned was that it costs 0.5 ADA to mint. I would (and have below mentioned that it costs - or you need to send 1 ADA for first ADA then it is 0.5 ADA per NFT after that). 

Here is another personal observation I would make about minting (as not a coder): 

\- Always give a unique reference for the 'Ticker' field. Not all of the websites I have used to mint state this needs to be unique. (Looking at CardanoNFTFactory I cannot actually see a 'Ticker' field - just 'Name' and 'Description' field plus any other Metadata fields you want to add - so the question arises - does CardanoNFTFactory automatically create the Ticker?). 

So I was wondering if you had any insights like above from your testing/minting experience (particularly about Ticker field now that I have noticed it)? Have you spoken to any Devs and do you know of any developments? Any pros and cons you have noticed (like I mentioned in my comments below when I have used Minterr and other Cardano NFT creator sites)? (I'm a Business Analyst and have done quite a bit of requirements elicitation and UAT testing post deliveries of software - so I know what I look for regarding my requirements when I test new NFT websites, but I forget others might have different requirements and websites are designed for different needs)

Apologies that I did not make my initial enquiry easier to understand. I hope this explanation helps.",hq6f33v,2021-12-27 18:53:51,sub1980,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/ro1cx1/how_to_start_nft_collection/hq6f33v/,1,0,,1,0,ro1cx1,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"Ok as a disclaimer, I am the dev of this website.

There is a minimum fee of 1ADA but when u mint two or more NFTs it is 0.5ADA + transaction fees.

Regarding uniqueness: only the nft_name in combination with the policyId is unique. Name, Description and other meta data entries are ur free choice. If you try to mint the same nft_name with different metadata, the latest metadata entry counts.

Our page is an attempt to enable cheap and easy to use minting for everyone. I am working on my own and just started to draw attention on it that people start to use it. So far, I tested everything and tried to resolve all bugs. 

This tool is for anyone who wants to start minting their own NFTs in smaller number. Also, nami wallet a more efficient minting than other services why It Is cheaper. The website is for non Code people and artists to create their first NFTs.

CardanoNFTs,,"We hear you. It is a big challenge to create that many artworks with enough visual variety without turning into something generic or arbitrary. ANF spent a long time tweaking the colors and smaller details and we reached a level where our code is producing consistent interesting results and beautiful compositions. Each Halo has its own character if you look at it closely. If you told us to sort out works from those 10k, we would have a really hard time doing that. During the development process, ANF produced a lot of halos and some had little glitches and errors and it was painful to delete them even though they had flaws. We are biased of course, but we are getting some really good feedback and we hope the collectors will feel the same attachment for the works.  
ANFs other NFTs on ETH are not really that accessible price-wise for most people. 1 on 1 editions that sell for between 4k and 10k $. With the Halos being a 10k edition on Cardano it opens up the collector base much more.",hihnu6o,2021-10-29 08:47:44,kn0bUtx0,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Developer'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/qhprzb/we_are_excited_to_announce_our_special_halo/hihnu6o/,2,0,,2,0,qhprzb,comment

Just wanna say I did scour the internet before asking this next question but its a wasteland out there, guess we're still early.

What would I need to change in the code to upload my own metadata instead of using metadataPlaceHolder? I have a fat file with all the metadata that I wanted to use instead, so could I have it take the relevant pieces from it? 

I saw on the api page that ""metadata"" can be used instead of ""metadataPlaceHolder"", but theres nothing to explain how or what it actually does lol

CardanoNFTs,,"I had the same issue. Turns out Nami Wallet mint is demo website and doesn’t have a full fledged minting suite. I will not recommend it. It seems easy but if you have a gif or a bigger file, it can’t handle it. Your NFT will be incomplete and only metadata will be minted. 
And yes, policy IDs are different for all NFTS(sometimes they are same)

I recommend Cardano Tools io 
They have full minting solution and doesn’t cost much, actually cheaper than Nami as you can mint multiple NFT under one policyID so only have to transaction fee(they return you the amount send back immediately)

That’s the best solution right now, until smart contract is integrated with NFTs.

CardanoNFTs,Awareness Post for CNFT.IO from an aspiring digital artist,"TL:DR: I am beyond upset, and feel like the community needs answers from the team at CNFT.io. There is no way that some people should have to wait over a month and others get immediate verification.

I have recently begun creating and minting NFTs and began the process of verification for CNFT.io. My experience so far has been abysmal and I have serious concerns about the leaders of the site. 

One week ago, I submitted a pull request on Github for verification purposes, and since then, I have noticed that certain projects get preferential treatment. For example, pull request #257 from Aug 15th is still open, as is my pull request #1883. Yet, there were 9 projects verified yesterday that didn’t have to wait more than an hour. There are 888 open pull requests and people who have been waiting for weeks are getting consistently passed over. There is no interaction from the team, there are 49 open issues spanning from a month ago to an hour ago and most people’s problems are that only certain projects are able to be verified and even when some projects are verified, the artist still cannot successfully post their art on the marketplace.",q18ndi,2021-10-04 16:13:53,Optimal-Barnacle2771,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Marketplace'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/q18ndi/awareness_post_for_cnftio_from_an_aspiring/,6,0,16,6,0,q18ndi,post

You can find/listen to the Audio file here (it is made while live looping with a Boss RC505 Looping Station, playing loops with my guitar, some basic beatbox and adding a gospel sample, which i recorded in Mombasa/Kenya in a tiny living room, while a gospel group was practicing for church): [https://pool.pm/54d78c0d69850c669bd29743dbc3e271c7f182ddb5c9e86f16cdd9e0.Likoni](https://pool.pm/54d78c0d69850c669bd29743dbc3e271c7f182ddb5c9e86f16cdd9e0.Likoni)

Question: What is meant by ""Metadata""? Does this include the file itself? 

When i open [pool.pm](https://pool.pm) and i search for my nft, i can't simply find it. Does somebody know, if there are other sites/explorers for cardano nfts that show the NFT's with its minted Audio data?

I listed the NFT on [https://tokhun.io/marketplace/0yRnX3](https://tokhun.io/marketplace/0yRnX3) , but when i view the sale, there is no possibility to listen to the audio before buying it.. :(

Maybe I should wait for cardanosounds, before starting my project.

CardanoNFTs,What is a good starting budget to buy NFTs?,"Hello, I know the question is pretty general but I would like to know how much is a good budget for buying “good” projects. 

Would like to test the waters of NFT.",pzxiyx,2021-10-02 15:40:22,Awaythrow311,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pzxiyx/what_is_a_good_starting_budget_to_buy_nfts/,6,0,7,6,0,pzxiyx,post
CardanoNFTs,,"The way I see it, 20-30ADA is my comfort zone (and that's pretty low in secondary market, the way I see it) as I am not a man with lots of huge funds. Secondary markets I know of are [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io), Tokhun. There are more as we progress. CNFT scene is super new so there are lots of exciting things to look up to! If you'd love to be certain as to whether it's a good project or not, I'd encourage you to check out their Twitter, join Discord servers, read their website thoroughly. For the projects I mentioned, incoming mints will take place in weeks time (i think), so that gives you some time to consider. 

&#x200B;

I'd highly recommend Entheos to you. Tons of them are currently selling at affordable rate and we are not even done with the entire minting process. Solid team, great community, awesome pieces. Can't ask for more! Here's for more: [https://www.entheosart.com/](https://www.entheosart.com/) FYI: Third mint incoming. 

&#x200B;

Aw0k3n is another recent project that caught my attention. The first mint was disastrous but the team own up instantly. This simply shows transparency and professionalism. Props to them. I am one of the lucky few to actually receive a free aw0k3n piece after being wrongly refunded. Here's for more: [https://aw0k3n.io/home](https://aw0k3n.io/home) In a way, this has similar ""concept"" to Cardano Trees.",hf45mdr,2021-10-02 16:40:48,jimmyjhslash,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pzxiyx/what_is_a_good_starting_budget_to_buy_nfts/hf45mdr/,3,0,,3,0,pzxiyx,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"If you believe in a project and you can make it in the beginning, you won't need much ADA. Jimmy is right 20-30 ADA can get you your first CNFT, and maybe it can be worth more later on. I think you can also decide to save more if you want a different NFT. They are all so unique. Each project has rarity charts for the most part too so you can understand what you are investing in in terms of rarity at least. Consider use cases for the project you are investing in as well.",hf7ucsv,2021-10-03 12:16:31,MessatsuBlack,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pzxiyx/what_is_a_good_starting_budget_to_buy_nfts/hf7ucsv/,2,0,,2,0,pzxiyx,comment
CardanoNFTs,,"Depends on if you want to buy second hand or mint...

If you want to get in at a lower price point, then you should try to mint them yourself. The normal mint price is \~25-50 ada.

If the project is successful then they can be worth 10-100x very quickly.

You also get an introduction to the community and how the whole system works a lot better this way.

CardanoNFTs,,If you want to mint…a lot of mints are 24-50 Ada range and that only gets you one.  But on good projects you can flip for a quick 100 Ada.

CardanoNFTs,,"I think most early NFT's will be worth it long term, it's like stepping into a coin early, especially the ones dropped before the smart contracts. Sure not every project will make you huge gains, but we are still early in the crypto adoption and prices will go up eventually assuming Cardano is a project that will make it to the finish line. The current NFT prices when a project dropps are not insane and I personally see them as a long term investment rather then the short term flipping.  


That being said it looks like you have some solid projects even for short term gains. It's just a matter if you want to make money fast or gamble it long term as I did by stepping into Cardano early.",hbmggh0,2021-09-04 22:56:41,fsidemaffia,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/pi0bve/how_are_my_cardano_nft_picks_as_a_beginner/hbmggh0/,3,0,,3,0,pi0bve,comment

CardanoNFTs,CNFT Swap shop,"Hi! I see there's a few other people like me here just experimenting with minting our first NFTs. I've listed mine for sale on [CNFT.io](https://CNFT.io), but as it's not a verified project and is really just some beginner's generative art project, that ain't gonna happen, so I would just as happily swap 1-for-1 with some other maker who is starting out.

Making a sale would be amazing, but building a community comes first! Let me know which one you want, what you're swapping for, and your receiving address of course!

CardanoNFTs,Running the unsigned_algorithm to generate art locally with python,"First off this is amazing that the code itself it embedded in the Cardano blockchain with the asset. Truly first of its kind. I could not find instructions on how to find the code and run it locally for unsigned\_algorithm. So have noted the step I followed to generate one.

This needs python3 along with 2 packages to be installed

    pip3 install numpy
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

1. Find the Source\_tx\_id in pool.pm for the asset
2. Search the transaction id in Cardano block explorer explorer.cardano.org
3. Click ""Show Unmoderated Content"" in the warning section for metadata
4. Under the ""src"" part of the JSON you should see the python code that needs to be run
5. Copy from ""import numpy as np"" till ""img.save(f'unsig\_{i:05d}.png')""
6. Search and replace double quotes at the start and end of line also the commas ONLY at the end of the lines
7. Replace the properties for multipliers, colors, distributions and rotations with your properties
8. Save the file and run from the saved location using 'python3 filename.py'
9. The image should be generated with name given in index in the same folder as the code

Change ""dim=4096"" value for even higher resolution.

Formatted code as is from blockchain after removing quotes and commas.

    import numpy as np
    from PIL import Image
    
    #pixel dimension
    dim = 4096

CardanoNFTs,,"A copy of a NFT makes it more or less fungible and a non-NFT ;)

But, jokes aside, here’s how NFTs in Cardano work:

Whenever you make (“mint”) a token you can attach metadata to that minting action.
Most of the image based NFTs have a reference (kind of a link if you will) to the image of the token, hosted on ipfs. 
IPFS is another blockchain project, suited for long term storage and immutability of those stores files.

So what an NFT basically represents is just the ownership with a reference to the source file.
You can actually store a the whole file on the cardano blockchain but it would be immensely expensive.
A transaction can be up to ~16kb and a block can hold about 2MB.
With ~0.17 of fees per transaction as a minimum you can do the math yourself. This goes without saying that you need to figure out a way on how to split the book into multiple transactions and store it in the metadata.

So my suggestion would be to find a way on how to represent the book on ipfs - maybe as a html page. You can then embed the ipfs refrence into the metadata and third party tools like pool.pm will query this reference and display it if everything is set properly.

As of now, most self service portal only feature image uploading.

CardanoNFTs,,"For the things you've said, it seems like the seller didn't see your order. Once you made an order the nft gets delisted automatically, so I'm guessing it continues that way if the order gets canceled. 

Same here, I don't know if we supposed to get a message it that situation.

Just out of curiosity, what kind of nft were you trying to buy? I'm hoping I'm not that seller and I didn't see the order lol",h9eeffd,2021-08-18 11:58:03,acanalestw,[],/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/p6meop/experience_with_cnft_sellers/h9eeffd/,1,0,,1,0,p6meop,comment

CardanoNFTs,Storing geo data on transaction metadata to create NFT,"Hello r/CardanoNFTs had a question involved how I could store sensor / GeoData using transaction metadata.

https://developers.cardano.org/docs/transaction-metadata/

I wanted to implement a NFT for a idea I had called Poseidon Projects. My goal for this NFT project is to collect geo-data (o2 sensors, water levels and temperatures, wind speeds, sunlight) on eco friendly wake powered buoy and use that data from my NFT to help  oceanographers better understand our oceans. Maybe this project could even help better predict how carbon emissions are effectively destroying the polar ice caps. 

Also, I wanted to learn more about where to start as-well In development and deployment as-well as find like minded individuals to help me achieve this goal.",oqmy7q,2021-07-24 09:45:30,DJ_CONZ,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/CardanoNFTs/comments/oqmy7q/storing_geo_data_on_transaction_metadata_to/,6,0,2,6,0,oqmy7q,post
