B.o.B Strange Clouds (Warner)
Fame seems to be a point of contention for this young American rapper/singer-songwriter, who broke out in 2010 with the song Nothin' On You (featuring Bruno Mars).
Album closer Where You Are, for instance, sees his cocky showbiz persona and Bobby Ray (that's his real name) argue about getting lost in the popularity game.
Other songs, like the Airplanes-esque Both Of Us (feat. Taylor Swift) are competent and radio-friendly, but don't display much staying power.
