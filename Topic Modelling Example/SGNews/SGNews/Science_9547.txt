If your little ones constantly have their eye on your iPhone or iPad, why not put their spy skills to good use? London-based mobile app developer Stealth Education has launched ABC Spy and ABC Spy Phonics, two iPad and iPhone apps that use assisted-learning, photography and social sharing to help children master Roman alphabets.
Appealing to children's natural curiosity and love of technology, ABC Spy promises hours of parent-approved learning and interactive fun. It encourages children to explore the world around them - whether they're at home, at a friend's house or on a long car journey.
Much like the original I Spy game, ABC Spy lets the child choose a letter of the alphabet and then find an object to photograph that begins with that letter. The child can get help from Simon Spider, an in-app character who makes suggestions about what to seek and photograph.
When they've taken the photo they can then frame, edit and name it to create a catalogue of the images. Tapping Make A Film transforms the photographs taken into a video that can be watched on the phone and even posted on YouTube to share with friends and family.
Realising the importance of recognition and reward, ABC Spy awards trophies for key achievements such as taking a picture for every letter in the alphabet. Statistics provided within the app allows parents to see how the child is progressing - as well as checking on how much time they have clocked up using the app.
ABC Spy not only helps children expand their vocabulary, but subconsciously creates a link between the alphabet and words to objects they see, touch and care about.
