The driver of the Lexus in last Saturday's crash at the junction of Rochor Road and Victoria Street was charged yesterday.
Kelvin Seah Koon Yong, 30, was charged with drink driving and driving dangerously when he allegedly beat a red light at the junction at about 3am. The front of his car crashed into the side of a ComfortDelGro taxi.
The taxi driver was unhurt, but his passenger was treated for minor injuries.
Seah was arrested at the scene.
His breathalyser test result is said to have registered at least 42 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath.
The prescribed legal limit in Singapore is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath.
Seah's case has been adjourned and he is due back in court on June 13.
Outside the courtroom, Seah's father, who was accompanying him, shouted that the press was "creating a big hoo-ha over a small matter".
He also hurled vulgarities at press photographers and reporters outside the Subordinate Courts.
Last Saturday's crash came exactly two weeks after another collision at the same junction.
In the wee hours of May 12, a Ferrari driven by a Chinese national allegedly beat a red light and crashed into a taxi, which then hit a motorcycle.
That incident claimed three lives: those of the Ferrari driver, and the taxi driver and his passenger.
The motorcyclist and a passenger in the Ferrari were injured.
To make the junction safer, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has synchronised the signals at the junction with those of the pedestrian crossing linking Bugis Junction and Bugis Village, so that they turn green at the same time.
LTA also said it will reinstate next year a set of overhead traffic signals which were removed due to the MRT works in the area.
