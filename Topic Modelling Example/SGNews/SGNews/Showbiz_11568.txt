WASHINGTON - Pop diva Lady Gaga set a social media record Thursday when she became the first person on Twitter to amass more than 25 million followers, more than anyone else on the micro-blogging website.
"#25milliontweetymonsters wow! I'm officially feeling like the luckiest girl in the world today. Last sold out show in Singapore in 2 hrs!" she tweeted from Southeast Asia, where she has been on tour.
Seven of the nine most-followed people on Twitter are pop singers: Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber (in second place with nearly 22.9 million followers), Katy Perry, Rihanna, Britney Spears, Shakira and Taylor Swift.
The outliers are US President Barack Obama, in seventh place with 17 million followers, and reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who is eighth with 14.8 million, according to twittercounter.com.
Lady Gaga previously made Twitter history as the first to surpass the 10, 15 and 20 million follower milestones.
News of her latest breakthrough came on the heels of her decision to cancel the Indonesian leg of her "Born This Way" tour in the face of threats from Muslim hardliners.
She used Twitter to apologize to fans, saying: "We had to cancel the concert in Indonesia. I'm so very sorry to the fans &amp; just as devastated as you if not more. You are everything to me."
