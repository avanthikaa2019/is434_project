Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung has re-arranged the interior of her new luxury house due to feng shui, reported Oriental Daily.
Cheung was said to be trying to "chase away" women who were trying to get close to her former husband Nicholas Tse.
The Hong Kong media reported that Cheung, who divorced last year, had tried to reconcile with Tse.
Cheung announced recently that she would take a break from show business to look after her children.
The media speculated that the break was part of the actress' efforts to get back with Tse.
