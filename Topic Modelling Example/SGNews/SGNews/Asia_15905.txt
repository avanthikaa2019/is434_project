TAIPEI - Taipei is stepping up efforts to encourage "green funerals" as part of an environmental awareness campaign, asking its residents to consider cremation and natural disposal of ashes rather than other types of burials.
The environmental campaign includes an annual Joint Sea Burial event that will take place this year on May 11, in collaboration with the neighboring metropolitan areas of New Taipei City and Taoyuan County.
The event, promoted under the slogan "Come with the winds and go with the waves," invites families to take part in a joint sea burial in waters off Taiwan's northwestern coast.
In addition to sea burials, the Taipei City Government is also promoting the idea of burying the ashes of the deceased in biodegradable containers instead of storing them in mausoleums or ossuaries.
