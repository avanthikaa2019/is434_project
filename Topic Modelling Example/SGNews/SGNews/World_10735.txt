LONDON - British Prime Minister David Cameron left his eight-year-old daughter at the pub for around a quarter of an hour following a family lunch, his Downing Street office confirmed Monday.
Nancy Cameron wandered off to the toilets while the premier and his wife Samantha were arranging lifts and the couple only realised she was missing once they got home, The Sun newspaper reported.
&ldquo;The prime minister and Samantha were distraught when they realised Nancy wasn't with them,&rdquo; a Downing Street spokesman said.
&ldquo;Thankfully when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well.
&ldquo;The prime minister went down straight away to get her.&rdquo;
He said the incident happened &ldquo;a couple of months ago&rdquo;.
The Camerons had been at The Plough in Cadsden, near the prime minister's country retreat of Chequers in Buckinghamshire, southeast England.
They had been to the pub with their children Nancy, six-year-old Arthur and 22-month-old Florence and two other families.
Cameron went back to Chequers with his bodyguards, thinking Nancy was in a second vehicle with his wife, while she thought their daughter had jumped in with him.
The mistake was only discovered when they got home.
Cameron drove back to The Plough and found his daughter cheerily helping staff. She was away from her parents for about 15 minutes.
