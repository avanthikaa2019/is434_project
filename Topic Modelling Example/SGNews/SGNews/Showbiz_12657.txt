Just like on his 2010 debut, Learning, Seattle singer-songwriter Mike Hadreas doesn't shy away from the tough issues on his second album.
He tackles subjects like abuse, addiction and prostitution, and with each song - heart-rendingly raw and drowning in reverb - it sounds like he's exposing his soul.
Standout tracks include the sparsely beautiful All Waters and the robust Hood.
