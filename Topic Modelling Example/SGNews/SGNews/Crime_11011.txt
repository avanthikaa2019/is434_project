A Vietnamese woman facing 20 charges of immigration-related offences was in court for a bail review hearing yesterday after the prosecution applied for her $150,000 bail to be revoked.
Nguyen Thi Hanh, 53, who was in court with her son and friends, had managed to raise the money.
And the prosecution's application was quashed by the court yesterday.
In an unusual turn, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) April Phang asked for a discharge not amounting to acquittal.
When District Judge Lim Tse Haw asked why, DPP Phang said the prosecution did not want to pursue the charges.
District Judge Lim subsequently granted the discharge.
But when Nguyen left the courtroom, she was immediately led away by the authorities.
It turns out that Nguyen is a fugitive with an Interpol Red Notice against her.
Court documents show that she has a long international criminal record involving drug trafficking and trafficking in women and children.
She is wanted by the Vietnamese police for running gambling dens and was also allegedly the leader of a criminal syndicate that organises soccer gambling.
DPP Phang said yesterday that Nguyen had fled Vietnam while out on bail.
Between Sept 8, 2010 and March 31 this year, Nguyen had entered Singapore on 15 occasions under a Laotian passport bearing the name of Phommalath Ketsana.
The Laotian authorities have said that this passport was obtained by dishonest means and it has been cancelled, said DPP Phang.
Nguyen had faced 10 charges of producing the misleading passport, five charges of entering Singapore without a valid pass and five of providing false information in her disembarkation forms.
