DUBLIN - A large majority of Irish Roman Catholics support married priests and also want women ordained as priests, according to a study Thursday for the Association of Catholic Priests.
The research found 87 percent believe priests should be allowed to marry, 72 percent said mature married men should be allowed to become priests and 77 percent favoured the ordination of women.
Despite a series of child sex abuse scandals in recent years that have rocked the Church in Ireland, 35 percent of those questioned attend mass weekly or more often, according to the research by Amarach Consulting.
Just one in five only go to mass for special occasions such as Christmas or Easter or for funerals and weddings while five percent say they never attend church.
The &ldquo;Contemporary Catholic Perspectives&rdquo; study found five times as many Catholics believe that the Church is subservient to Rome versus those who believe it is independent.
Some 28 percent believe the Irish Catholic Church is completely subservient to Rome and 29 percent believe it was &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; subservient. Only 3 percent believe the Irish Church is completely independent of the Vatican.
For 75 percent, the Church's teaching on sexuality is regarded as irrelevant to them and their family.
Some 46 percent disagreed strongly with Church teaching that homosexuality is immoral, with only nine percent agreeing strongly with the Church's attitude.
Amarach polled 1,000 Catholics in both the Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland. The poll has a margin of error of 3.1 percent.
