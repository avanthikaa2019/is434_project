Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra yesterday suggested the police ask Myanmar for help to arrest General Na Kha Muay, leader of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), who is wanted in Thailand for allegedly producing and trafficking narcotics.
She said it was the police department's duty to take legal action against the general as well as strictly implement the government's anti-drug policy.
It was reported that Tong Seng, a Myanmar citizen and well-known Karen supporter, travelled to the DKBA base yesterday to discuss the issue with the general so clashes between Karen and the Thais could be avoided.
Meanwhile, the general will be sending armed Karen soldiers to escort journalists from the Kawkareik Township to a press conference today.
The atmosphere at Tak's border districts of Umphang and Phob Phra remained unusually tense.
