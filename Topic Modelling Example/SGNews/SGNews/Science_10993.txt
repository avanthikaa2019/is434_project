OKLAHOMA CITY - Oklahoma City Thunder booked their place in the National Basketball Association (NBA) Finals on the back of a furious second-half comeback led by Kevin Durant to take a series- clinching 107-99 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.
The Thunder roared back from an 18-point deficit in the first half, outscoring San Antonio 59-36 in the second half to claim the Western Conference finals 4-2.
After halting the Spurs' 20-game winning streak last week, Oklahoma City surged into the finals by taking four straight games to overturn a 0-2 deficit.
Three-time NBA scoring champion Durant, 23, led the charge with a game-high 34 points and 14 rebounds.
"We kept playing hard. I tried to inspire my teammates with my play on both ends of the floor, and I'm glad we got this victory," he said.
