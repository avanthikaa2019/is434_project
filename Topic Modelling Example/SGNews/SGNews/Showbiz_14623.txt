It was supposed to be a raucous getai performance in the air-conditioned comfort of a nightclub with plenty of booze.
Instead, what patrons at Shanghai Dolly's second anniversary celebrations on Tuesday evening got was a selection of Mando- and Cantopop songs by live acts like pianist Sha Sha and in-house band Starway.
There was not a single dance move from the performers, nor a flamboyant costume in sight.
Billed as featuring a "super luxe getai performance", the Mandopop joint was at least decked out in the requisite flash.
But the evening felt more like a regular night out at sister nightspots Dragonfly and Firefly.
However, a spokesman for Shanghai Dolly insisted the nightspot's getai performances did happen as planned.
She added that the in-house artists showcased their versatility in fusing Mando, Canto and elements of getai into their shows.
Patrons The New Paper spoke to didn't seem too concerned whether the programme lived up to the theme or not.
Miss Edna Lim, 39, and her cheongsam-clad friends were having a ball.
The internal communications director was impressed with Shanghai Dolly's decor and atmosphere on her first visit, adding that the place really gave her a 1930s Shanghai feel.
She said: "I'm expecting a good time tonight. I especially love the classic song Ji Ba Ban!" Over at the entrance, Ms Trang Cao, 32, appeared more intent on creating her own form of entertainment.
The Vietnamese, who's working here as a marketing manager, was striking a variety of poses for her friend, who was gamely snapping away.
She said: "I come here every Friday night.
"The music here is very 'chillax'. It's lively enough that we're not bored and it kind of gets you in the mood for grooving."
After the first series of live acts finished around 9pm, the speakers began playing English clubbing music.
And when Timmy Thomas' (Dying Inside) To Hold You came on, you knew for sure getai was definitely not on the menu.
