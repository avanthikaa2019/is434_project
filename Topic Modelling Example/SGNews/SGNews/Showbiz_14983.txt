HONG KONG - A heart-warming drama film depicting the relationship between an elderly loyal servant and her young master swept all the major categories of the Hong Kong Film Awards on Sunday.
"A Simple Life" scooped five gongs for best film, director, screenplay, actor and actress at the star-studded event considered Hong Kong's equivalent of the Oscars.
"I would like to thank Hong Kong," Ann Hui said after grabbing the best director award.
"I grew up here and I received my education here. This city has given me a lot of inspirations," she said during the glitzy ceremony held at the harbourfront Hong Kong Cultural Centre.
The best actor and best actress honour went to the film's lead characters played by Andy Lau and Deanie Ip.
Sixty-four-year-old Ip played a servant who wants to move into a nursing home after suffering a stroke in "A Simple Life", a role that also won her the best actress award at the Venice film festival and Asian Film Awards.
"I only won this award in my 60s -- this could be the first and last time," she said in an emotional speech.
The annual Hong Kong Film Awards -- celebrating its 31st edition this year -- is one of the two Chinese film's industry most prestigious events, alongside Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards.
The southern Chinese city which became an international movie powerhouse in the 1970s remains a rich source of film talent, with its stars enjoying huge popularity across Asia.
There have been increasing collaborations between Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland filmmakers in recent years to tap the lucrative market of movie-goers in China, one of the fastest rising markets.
