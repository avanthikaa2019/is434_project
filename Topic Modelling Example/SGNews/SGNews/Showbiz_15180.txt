MANILA, Philippines - American Idol viewers sent Filipino-American Jessica Sanchez into the bottom but the shocked judges came to her rescue Thursday.
"This girl is one of the best singers in America. Are you kidding me?" said AI judge Randy Jackson. "Everybody please vote for the best!"
As the 16-year-old student was singing her swan song, the Idol judges unanimously decided to save Sanchez, an option that they can use once in a season to save a favored contestant voted out by viewers.
