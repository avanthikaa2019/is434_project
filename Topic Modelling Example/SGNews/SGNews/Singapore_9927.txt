On March 28, 1967, an 18-year-old Mr Albel Singh found himself first in line for national service (NS) registration at the Central Manpower Base in Dempsey Road.
That fateful morning, he became Singapore's first national serviceman, entering Basic Military Training four months later.
He was just eight months out of secondary school.
Training was tough and the food was horrible, he recalled.
Little did he expect he would serve 32 years in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).
He left the SAF in 1999, retiring proudly as a lieutenant-colonel, the commander of the 29th Singapore Infantry Brigade.
Now 63, the general manager of Bintan Resorts will take part in the Majulah Moment at the National Day Parade on Aug 9, a flag-raising ceremony which affirms the participants' allegiance to the country.
"I feel honoured that I was the first one (to enlist), and for the opportunity to represent my cohort for their contributions," he said. "It's a very significant moment for me. NS is a responsibility. The defence of Singapore is a reality."
Mr Singh went through two military operations while in NS.
He recalled being deployed to Tai Seng in 1969, in case a Sino-Malay race riot in Kuala Lumpur spilled over into Singapore.
But what he remembers vividly is guarding the beaches of Changi in the aftermath of the Konfrontasi a year earlier.
"We could see the Indonesian armada across the waters," he said.
"We were there for real. It's not a game," he said.
"It dawned on me that we ourselves must protect our nation."
A year after his deployment at Tai Seng, Mr Singh signed on as a regular.
