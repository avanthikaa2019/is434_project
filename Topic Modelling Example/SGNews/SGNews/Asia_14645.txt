ISLAMABAD - All 127 people on board a Boeing 737 that crashed near Islamabad in bad weather are dead, hospital and civil aviation officials said on Saturday.
The Bhoja Air flight from Karachi came down in fields near a residential area on the edge of the Pakistani capital on Friday evening, as it was attempting to land at the city's international airport.
Civil aviation official Junaid Khan told AFP: &ldquo;All 127 people died. No one survived. There was no possibility of any survivor in this crash.&rdquo;
Doctor Waseem Khawaja, who is in charge of Islamabad's main hospital, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, said bodies had been brought in more than 100 bags.
&ldquo;There was no survivor, all on board are dead,&rdquo; Khawaja told AFP. Witnesses said the plane burst into flames after crashing, but Waseem said most of the bodies were not charred and 73 had been identified already.
