SEOUL - North Korea will celebrate a major anniversary this month on an "unprecedented" scale to commemorate late leaders and rally behind its young new ruler, media said Tuesday.
Pyongyang on April 15 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of its first leader Kim Il-Sung, founder of the dynasty which has ruled since 1948. It has billed the event as heralding its rise as "a powerful and prosperous nation".
Choson Sinbo, a pro-North newspaper in Japan which reflects Pyongyang's official thinking, said a cultural festival will be "far different in scale and detail" than before.
The spring festival to be held in Pyongyang from April 11-19 will feature some 800 local and foreign performers, more than twice the number last year, it said.
Ruling communist party newspaper Rodong Sinmun also stressed the need to lavishly celebrate what it called "the unprecedented happy occasion" and urged people to rally firmly behind new leader Kim Jong-Un.
The party will hold a special conference on April 11 in an apparent move to complete the power transfer to Jong-Un, who took office under a second dynastic succession when his father Kim Jong-Il died last December.
Pyongyang plans to launch a satellite between April 12-16 to mark the centenary and will celebrate the founding of the country's army on April 25.
The United States and numerous other nations have strongly criticised the launch as a disguised missile test in violation of UN resolutions.
"In our history, there was no more significant month than April this year...we should mark the significant holiday as an unprecedented political festival never seen before," Rodong Sinmun said.
The North suffered famine in the 1990s and still grapples with severe food shortages. Industry is hard hit by shortages of power and raw materials.
South Korean officials estimate the cost of the rocket launch at S$1.06 billion, enough to feed most of the North's population for a year, and the cost of the other celebratory events at S$2.5 billion.
