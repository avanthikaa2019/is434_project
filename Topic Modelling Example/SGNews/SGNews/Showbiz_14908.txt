Compared to his acid-tongued peers on Fashion Police, celebrity stylist George Kotsiopoulos comes across as a real Mr Nice Guy.
Indeed, it is comedy icon Joan Rivers, and television hosts Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana Rancic, who are the "slammers" on the show, which sees the panel discussing the sartorial hits and misses of Hollywood's biggest names.
The show airs here every Saturday on E! Entertainment (StarHub Ch 441).
On the line with my paper from Los Angeles recently, Kotsiopoulos, 43, made it clear that he tries not to be catty on the show. But he doesn't hold back when it comes to the clients he styles off-camera.
"If I need to tell them that something makes them look thick in the middle, or heavier than they are, then that's just the way it is," he said. "It's not an insult. I get paid to be honest."
As for the biting criticisms dished out by his colleagues on Fashion Police, Illinois-born Kotsiopoulos - who is of Greek descent - insisted "it's all for fun".
In past episodes of the show, which debuted in 2010, 78-year-old Rivers has taken potshots at everyone from Angelina Jolie to Kim Kardashian.
"It's never a personal attack," said Kotsiopoulos. "(The celebrities) get it... They think it's hysterical."
He added: "I've noticed that the bigger a celebrity is, the less they care what we say."
Kotsiopoulos - who has over 16 years' experience as a stylist, having worked with such names as singer Katy Perry, actor Gerard Butler and actress Anne Hathaway - revealed that his co-hosts actually come to him for fashion advice. And vice versa, apparently.
"I would ask them 'Do you think this is cute?' or 'Do you like this colour on me?' - that sort of thing," he admitted with a laugh. "We all do that, because we know we'll be totally honest with each other."
Still, ask who among them has the best sense of style, and Kotsiopoulos doesn't skip a beat. "I do!" he gushed. "Without a doubt!"
We wonder if Joan would agree, Georgie.
