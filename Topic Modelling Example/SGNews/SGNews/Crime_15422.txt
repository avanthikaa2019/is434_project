KUCHING - Two brothers were charged at the Sessions Court yesterday for causing a riot at the Sarawak Stadium on Saturday.
Abang Saiful Zahrin Abang Abdul Rahim, 30, and Abang Mohammad Zakri, 28, claimed trial to the charges.
Abang Saiful Zahrin also claimed trial to causing hurt to 33-year-old Light Strike Force Lance Corporal Amzari Othman with a weapon.
Judge Dayang Ellyn Narisa Abang Ahmad set RM10,000 (S$4100) bail in two sureties for each accused and set July 13, 16 and 17 for trial.
Inspector Carl Patrick Ramesh prosecuted while the brothers were represented by Shankar Ram.
The duo, students of a private university here, were alleged to have committed the offence after the Malaysian Super League match between Sarawak and Kelantan, which ended with a 1-1 draw.
It was reported that some football fans were unhappy with the results and began to riot, hurling abuses and bottles and stones at players and team officials.
As policemen moved in to bring the situation under control, an argument erupted between them that led to the assault on Amzari, leaving him unconscious in the melee. He was later given outpatient treatment at Sarawak General Hospital.
The incident was the second involving the rowdy "Bujang Senang" supporters. The first was at the Sarawak versus Singapore Lions XII match on March 17, where firecrackers were thrown on the pitch and a bus outside the stadium was destroyed by local supporters.
