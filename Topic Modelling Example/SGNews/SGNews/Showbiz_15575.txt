She made TV viewers laugh in Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives.
But former Miss America Vanessa Williams, 49, has been keeping a painful secret since she was a child.
In her new memoir, You Have No Idea, she discloses that she was molested by a woman, reported US media.
She was just 10 when the incident took place during a visit to family friends in California.
The culprit, a girl named Susan, was a friend of the family, reported People, which published excerpts of the book.
She told the magazine: "Susan, who was 18, smoked, drove a car and was the epitome of cool.
"Nancy (her friend) and I slept in the den. One night Susan crept in. She told me to lie down on the rug. I was confused.
"Are we going to play a game? As I tried to make sense of it, Susan pulled down the bloomers of my cotton baby-doll pyjamas.
"'What are you doing?' I asked. "'Don't worry - it'll feel good.'"
Susan then told the young Williams: "Don't tell anyone."
Williams said that after the visit, "I felt something change in me".
She said: "I had always been defiant, but I became a bit more rebellious. I began to pull away from my parents."
She admitted to smoking marijuana in high school and had an abortion in her senior year.
She then started on the beauty pageant circuit and was crowned Miss America in 1983 - the first African-American woman to do so.
She lost the crown reign after a nude photo scandal broke.
Williams told People that she has moved on from the sexual assault.
"It didn't paralyse me," she said.
"And I don't dwell."
