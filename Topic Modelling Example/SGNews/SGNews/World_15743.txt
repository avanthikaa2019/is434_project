LONDON - British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Saturday called for a peaceful handover of power in Malawi after the death of President Bingu wa Mutharika was officially confirmed.
"In this moment of sadness I offer condolences to President Mutharika's family. I urge all sides to remain calm and that a peaceful handover takes place as provided for under Malawi's constitution," Hague said in a statement.
Malawi's government on Saturday confirmed the president's death at age 78 from a heart attack after two days of denial or silence, and vowed that it would respect the constitution under which power would pass to Vice President Joyce Banda.
Relations between Britain and Malawi became strained in spring last year after WikiLeaks leaked a diplomatic cable on its website in which the British ambassador accused Mutharika of "becoming ever more autocratic and intolerant of criticism".
Malawi expelled the ambassador and London retaliated by ejecting Malawi's envoy from Britain.
London then suspended budgetary aid to Malawi because of its failure to tackle Britain's "serious concerns over economic management, governance and human rights."
