Two parliamentarians yesterday accused each other of being gigolos during an exchange of words at question time in Parliament.
Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare Dilan Perera was the first to call Ratnapura District UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayaka a gigolo, when a question was raised by the latter regarding the fate of Sri Lankan housemaid Rizana Nafeeq, who is on death row in Saudi Arabia for allegedly killing an infant.
"There are gigolos who go from here and stage protests in front of our embassies but no problem could be solved in this manner," Minister Perera said referring to Rizana's case.
