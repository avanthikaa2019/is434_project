Top actress Jun Ji-hyun, a.k.a. Gianna Jun, married a Korean businessman at Hotel Shilla in central Seoul on Friday, waving goodbye to single life.
She tied the knot with Choi Jun-hyeok, the grandson of acclaimed hanbok designer Lee Young-hee and the son of also famous fashion designer Lee Jeong-woo.
"I feel nervous but I will make a return for those who supported me by showing them my happy married life," said Jun during a press conference held at the hotel just hours before her wedding.
At the ceremony, the 31-year-old actress wore a beautiful wedding gown designed by Lebanese designer Reem Acra delivered directly from the designer's shop in New York, while she chose another goddess-like dress embellished with sparkling crystal from British designer Jenny Packham for the press conference.
Singer Lee Jeock, known to be one of Jun's favorites, sang a wedding song for the couple, the agency said.
The agency added that Jun will continue her acting career after the marriage.
Her husband Choi currently is working at Bank of America's Seoul branch, according reports.
The two have known each other since they were in their early 20s, and started dating about a year ago.
Rumors spread earlier this year that the two would soon marry after news came out in December that they were dating.
Jun's mother-in-law Lee is known to have recently introduced Jun to her friends as her future daughter-in-law.
The actress confirmed of her marriage last month.
Jun, who debuted in 1997 as a fashion model, rose to stardom after the mega-hit 2001 movie "My Sassy Girl."
She made her English-language debut in 2009 with the film "Blood: The Last Vampire," and recently starred in the movie "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" with Hollywood star Hugh Jackman and top Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi.
Her new movie, "The Thieves" will be released this summer.
