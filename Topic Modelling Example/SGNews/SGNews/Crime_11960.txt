Twelve Taiwanese nationals were arrested in Chon Buri yesterday for alleged involvement in a call-centre scam.
Chon Buri police searched a rented house in Bang Lamung suspected of being the base of a foreign call-centre scam, deceiving victims to transfer money to the syndicate.
Three houses were in the complex. After a search, police arrested 12 Taiwanese nationals, both male and female, including Chen Chin-shan, 36, the alleged leader of the gang. Chen also faced additional charges after he tried to bribe police with Bt1.5 million to release him.
Police seized office equipment, notebook computers, plus communication devices for Internet access and notebooks.
Authorities also searched another rented house where the group was staying before moving to the aforementioned house. They found another 25 phones, eight notebook computers and modems for Internet access.
