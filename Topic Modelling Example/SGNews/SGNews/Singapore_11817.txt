In the report, "Two Malaysians charged with match-fixing" in my paper last Friday, the Associated Press stated that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said referee Shokri Nor and former player Thana Segar agreed to receive a bribe of RM15,000 (S$6,085) each, and Shokri was arrested and replaced when police learnt of the plot.
According to the CPIB, the total bribe was RM15,000 and not RM30,000 as implied. Also, Shokri was arrested and replaced as he was assisting CPIB in its investigations.
