BUKIT MERTAJAM, Malaysia - A 9-year-old girl was rescued less than 24 hours after she was taken by a woman who was believed to have had a personal grudge with her mother.T. Purani was rescued by a police team who raided the 23-year-old suspect's home in Jelutong yesterday afternoon.
Her mother, M. Santhi, 47, said she became suspicious when her daughter failed to return home after attending school on Monday afternoon.
She said she immediately contacted the van driver who transported Purani to the school and had a shock after being informed that her daughter was picked up by another woman.
"Based on the description of the woman's car, I sensed something was amiss and lodged a police report," she said at the Seberang Perai district police headquarters in Bandar Perda here yesterday.
Santhi said the woman had contacted her brother-in-law and demanded RM24,850 (S$10, 173) for her daughter's release.
She believed that the woman had held Purani to settle a score over a personal matter.
District deputy police chief Superintendent Baharudin Mustafa confirmed that police had detained a woman.
He said the girl was rescued during a joint-raid by the district police and the state police at a house in Jelutong.
He said police considered the case as solved following the arrest of the main suspect but would be picking up several men soon.
The case is being probed under Section 363 of the Penal Code that covers illegal confinement.
