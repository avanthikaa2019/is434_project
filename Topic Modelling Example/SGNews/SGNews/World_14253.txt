DIYARBAKIR - Six Kurdish militants were killed during clashes in eastern Turkey on Thursday, the local governor's office said, adding to a recent upsurge in conflict between the Turkish armed forces and separatist guerrillas.
Two Turkish soldiers also were reported killed on Wednesday in the fighting between the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and security forces in the Genc district of eastern Bingol province, according to a PKK website.
The Bingol governor's office said in a statement that one militant was captured alive.
Three Turkish soldiers and three PKK militants were killed in clashes on Tuesday. The arrival of milder spring weather typically fuels conflict in the region.
Talks between Turkey and the PKK to end the violence broke down and scores of militants, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then. Hundreds have been arrested on charges of secretly supporting the PKK.
Earlier this month, PKK militants killed two soldiers and wounded three along the Iraqi border. In March, Turkish security forces killed 15 female Kurdish militants in southeastern Bitlis province while rebels killed five special forces police officers in Sirnak province the same month.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in the fighting since the PKK took up arms in 1984.
The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United states and the European Union.
