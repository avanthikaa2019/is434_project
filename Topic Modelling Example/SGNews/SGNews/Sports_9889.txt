MANILA, Philippines - World boxing icon Manny Pacquiao won over Timothy Bradley in their fight for the World Boxing Organization welterweight crown, said a five-man panel of the WBO.
Upon its review, the WBO panel re-scored the controversial Timothy Bradley split-decision win over Pacquiao and had it 118-110, 117-111, 117-111, 116-112, 115-113 for the Filipino ring icon.
The fight's official result, however, still stands, according to WBO president Francisco Valcarcel.
"We can't change the result but we did this review for two reasons," Valcarcel told ESPN.com.
"If they want to make a rematch, we will approve the rematch and if they don't we will order one. Also, we wanted to show (the Nevada State Athletic Commission) that they could bring in other officials from outside of Nevada who can also do a fine job judging fights. It's good to have different officials."
Both fighters are said to be scheduled for a do over on November 10.
CJ Roth and Duane Ford, two of the three judges during the June 9 (June 10 in Manila) fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, scored it 115-113 for Bradley while Jerry Roth saw Pacquiao as the victor, 115-113.
Pacquiao had his 15 fight winning streak snapped. The loss was his first since Mexican legend Erik Morales beat him via unanimous decision back in 2005.
