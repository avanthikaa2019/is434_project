KLANG, Malaysia - A traffic policeman is on life support after a motorcycle thug swung a helmet at his head during an operation against Mat Rempit in Kampung Raja Uda early on Sunday.
Corporal Mustaghni Tabri, 48, is reported to be in critical condition at the intensive care unit of Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital. His assailant is still at large.
Mustaghni and 18 traffic policemen were in Lorong Bunga Raya, near Kampung Raja Uda, early on Sunday to nab illegal racers.
The policemen were split into several groups, with Mustaghni and a team stationed in an alley to block the escape route of the Mat Rempit.
At 1.45am, Mustaghni was confronted by three men on two motorcycles, who were trying to escape.
One of the men swung a helmet, hitting Mustaghni at the back of his head.
The three suspects sped off on their motorcycles without a second glance at the stricken policeman.
The traffic operation, led by Inspector Mohd Harman Mohd Haniff, was called off as the policemen rushed their colleague to hospital.
Tests later showed Mustaghni was bleeding in the brain and required a blood transfusion.
Klang South police chief Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Mat Yusop said no arrests had been made.
He said the case had been classified as attempted murder.
"The suspects are believed to be teenagers or in their early 20s. We are hunting for them."
