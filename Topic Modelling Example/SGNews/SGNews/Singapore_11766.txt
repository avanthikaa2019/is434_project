The Rotary Club of Singapore has denied accusations of having political interests tied to its $100,000 donation pledge for a scheme run by People's Action Party (PAP) in Hougang.
The plan to modernise old toilets in Hougang is led by Desmond Choo, the political party's candidate there.
According to a Straits Times (ST) report, Mr Choo has already raised enough funds to upgrade toilets in 30 homes.
Last week, the club announced that it would raise the money to help upgrade another 50 squat toilets to sitting ones.
However, the announcement caused for raised eyebrows as it came just two days shy of the Hougang by-election.
Former presidential candidate Mr Tan Cheng Bock also criticised the club's move for its bad timing.
He said on a Facebook post: "Giving money to a politician for a good cause during a political election campaign is venturing into the political arena".
In a May 24 article, President of the Rotary Club Kumar Tapan Rao told ST: 'The Rotary Club is not making any donation to any political party. We are raising funds for a project to help the elderly in Singapore.'
He later told the paper that he had never met Mr Choo and that the idea of a political dimension had not crossed his mind. The move, he said, was grounded on intentions of helping the elderly.
The Foundation of Rotary Clubs has also clarified that political activity in the name of rotary clubs is not allowed.
