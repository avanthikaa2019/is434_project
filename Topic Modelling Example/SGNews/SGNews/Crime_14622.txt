While the Indonesian maid was sleeping on March 13, 2010, her employer approached and brushed his hand from her right shoulder to her ankle, touching her clothes and skin.
She woke up and saw the 43-year-old man as he walked away towards his computer.
Frightened, she kept quiet and pretended to go back to sleep.
The next day, when they were alone, she told him that she would not work for him if he touched her again.
He agreed, but told her that he would "blacklist" her if she mentioned the incident to anyone.
She understood "blacklist" to mean that she would no longer be able to work in Singapore and agreed to continue working for him as long as he did not touch her again.
But that night, as the man, his family and the Indonesian maid slept in the living room of their Joo Chiat house - the family on two mattresses placed side by side and the maid on a sofa bed - he did it again.
She was outraged, but again kept quiet.
The next day, she told the man and his wife that she wanted to return to the maid agency immediately. They agreed.
Two days later, she reported the matter to the Indonesian Embassy, which contacted the police.
The man pleaded guilty yesterday to two charges of using criminal force on his maid with the knowledge that it would likely outrage her modesty.
He was fined $15,000 - $6,000 for the first incident and $9,000 for the second. He had earlier paid $3,000 as compensation to the maid.
The man also faced three charges of allegedly outraging the modesty and two of insulting the modesty of another maid who worked for him.
These five charges were compounded after he paid $5,000 to this maid.
In mitigation, the court heard that the man has three daughters and is self-employed, managing a sole proprietorship that supplies cleaning services.
