GOMBAK - Police have crippled a car and lorry theft syndicate, which is believed to have stolen more than 40 cars and lorries in Klang Valley and neighbouring states before taking them apart for parts at a warehouse in Taiping.
Gombak OCPD Asst Comm Abdul Rahim Abdullah said police got wind of the syndicate following the theft of a lorry near Taman Rawang Perdana.
"We received a report that a three ton Isuzu lorry was stolen at around 4am on Saturday.
"Following the theft, a task force was formed and found that the lorry was parked near a school at Padang Renggas, Kuala Kangsar," he said when contacted Sunday.
He said the team went to Kuala Kangsar and waited to ambush syndicate members when they drove off with the lorry.
"At around 1.30pm the team noticed three men in a Proton Wira car near the lorry.
"About an hour later, the three men came back and one of them drove the lorry to a warehouse along Jalan Simpang, Taiping," he said adding that the task force raided the chop shop at around 6.30pm.
ACP Abdul Rahim said police caught red-handed four men including a Bangladesh national dismantling the lorry.
"We also found 27 other stolen lorries, including three which had already been taken apart," he said.
He added that further inspection revealed 16 stolen cars, including five Mercedes Benz, four Proton Wira, a Mitsubishi Lancer, a Mitsubishi Pajero and a Kia Spectra.
ACP Abdul Rahim added that police also recovered an assortment of car and lorry parts including 465 car and lorry doors and 80 lorry diesel tanks.
"We arrested the four men all aged between 21 and 31 to facilitate further investigations," he said, adding that the case was classified as vehicle theft under Section 379A of The Penal Code.
He also urged anyone with information on the case to contact 03-6138 5222 or the nearest police station.
