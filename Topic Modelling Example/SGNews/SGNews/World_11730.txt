WASHINGTON - The US Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to review the use of Taser stun guns by police on two women, including one who was seven months pregnant at the time.
In one of the cases, Malaika Brooks was driving her son to school in the northwestern city of Seattle in 2004 when she was stopped for speeding. When she refused to get out of her car because she was just weeks away from giving birth, police zapped her three times.
In the other case, police used a Taser gun on Jayzel Mattos in her home in Hawaii in 2006 when she tried to stop the arrest of her husband.
Taser guns are weapons that deliver electric shocks and are popular with authorities because they are supposed to be nonlethal.
In both cases, the women argued that their constitutional rights had been violated.
Tuesday's decision by the prestigious nine-member panel follows a ruling by the US Ninth Court of Appeals that determined the defendent officers "did not violate (a) clearly established law" but did indeed use "excessive force."
Last week, Amnesty International called for the suspension of the use of Tasers by American police barring cases "involving an immediate threat of death or serious injury."
At least 43 people have died after being tased by police, increasing the number of deaths in the United States to 497 since 2001, the rights group said in its annual report.
