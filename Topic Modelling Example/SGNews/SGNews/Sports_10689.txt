Feng Shanshan captured the LPGA Championship on Sunday after firing a final-round six-under-par 67 that made her the first Chinese golfer to win a Major golf championship.
Feng carded five birdies in a flawless round to finish at six-under 282, two shots clear of Japan's Mika Miyazato (69), Norway's Suzann Pettersen (70), American Stacy Lewis (70) and South Korea's Ji Eun Hee (72).
