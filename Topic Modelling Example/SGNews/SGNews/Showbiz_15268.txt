Fresh, funky and infectious, the debut album by this Brighton pop-rap duo - both former students of the famous Brit School - doesn't take itself too seriously.
This proves a good thing, with songs like When I Was A Youngster and Homewrecker boasting clever lyrics and good-natured swagger.
Listen out for the Mariachi- influenced Down With The Trumpets.
