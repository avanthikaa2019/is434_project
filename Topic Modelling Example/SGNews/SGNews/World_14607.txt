BEIJING - China and Russia on Sunday launched their first joint naval exercises, state media said, amid tensions between China and its Asian neighbours over regional territorial claims.
The six days of drills are talking place in the Yellow Sea off China's east coast, the official China News Service said, adding these were the first exercises involving the navies of the two countries.
The exercises - taking place near China's Qingdao city off the coast of Shandong province - were launched by Russian and Chinese military officials on Sunday morning, the official Xinhua news agency said.
They come as China boosts military spending and asserts claims over disputed territory, including a chain of islands in the East China Sea, which is also claimed by Japan.
Beijing and Tokyo have a long-running dispute over the islands, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan - which sit in rich fishing grounds that may harbour lucrative energy resources.
The exercises will focus on joint air defence, anti-submarine tactics and search and rescue, Xinhua has previously said. They will also include simulated rescue of hijacked vessels and anti-terrorism drills.
China has 16 naval vessels and two submarines taking part while Russia has four warships.
China said Thursday that the exercises were aimed at upholding regional peace.
"This joint military exercise is a long scheduled one between China and Russia in order to uphold regional peace and stability," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin told a regular news briefing.
China and Russia have jointly participated in four military exercises since 2005, some involving other countries as well, Xinhua has said.
