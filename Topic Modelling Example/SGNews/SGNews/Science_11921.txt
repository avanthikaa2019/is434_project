Who would want to watch a South Korean soap that was a flop back home?
Lots of people, it turns out - something that Singapore-based start-up Viki feels vindicates its business model: an advertisement-supported streaming TV and movie site where unpaid fans add the foreign subtitles.
"We call it content arbitrage. Ninety per cent of content is trapped within borders. We're taking things that aren't travelling and making them go places," said Viki's CEO Razmig Hovaghimian.
Viki rides these trends: watching videos online, a fascination with foreign content, and the rise of sophisticated software for tasks like subtitling.
