Arsonists struck at a housing project in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, torching at least 20 vehicles.
It is the eighth such incident this year. Police believe that all the eight incidents could be linked.
Federal Territory Fire and Rescue Department assistant director Azizan Ismail told The Star that when firemen arrived at the scene after receiving a call early on Thursday morning, a number of motorcycles were already engulfed in flames.
He said: "A Nissan Grand Livina car parked nearby also caught fire. The fire was put out in about 20 minutes."
Nobody was injured in the incident, the report said.
Sixteen motorcycles, a Proton Saga and a one-tonne lorry were also set ablaze.
Mr Nawer Abdul Razak, 56, was asleep on the seventh floor of a nearby block of flats when he heard a loud noise. When he looked out of the window, he saw some motorcycles parked in front of his block on fire.
He told the New Straits Times: "I rushed down and discovered my Yamaha Lagenda on fire. Everyone was bringing buckets of water to douse the flames, but it was too late."
Mr Shaik Khusairi Shaik Daud said he lost two motorcycles in the attack. He said he saw the fire as his friend was dropping him off.
In one of the earlier incidents, 22 motorcycles were set ablaze at Jalan San Peng, Kuala Lumpur in April.
That fire also damaged four apartment units.
That incident was a result of a fight between two gangs at a nearby playground several minutes earlier.
Four hours later that day, a second fire was reported at Bandar Baru Sentul, also in Kuala Lumpur, involving six motorcycles.
