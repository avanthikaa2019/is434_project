Singapore's top illusionists, JC Sum and Magic Babe Ning, have revealed trade secrets behind some of their biggest tricks at a no-holds-barred lecture, titled "3 sides of Magic", at Sinema Old School.
For the first time ever, the partners of 6 years explained many of their original street magic routines, mind reading acts and stage illusions to 20 enthusiasts, hobbyists and amateur magicians gathered there.
Next on the magic duo's schedule is a 3-week stint in Italy where they will represent South East Asia in a magic-based reality TV show.
They have been on more than 25 programs, including a performance on long-running French variety program, "Le Plus Grand Cabaret du Monde" last year, to showcase Singapore magic to more than 60 million viewers.
The 2009 Merlin award winners of the "Most Original Illusionists of the Year" also reveal their plans for 2012, and a trick exclusively for RazorTV viewers.
