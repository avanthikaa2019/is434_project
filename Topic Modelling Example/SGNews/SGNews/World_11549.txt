NEW YORK - An inexperienced New York prosecutor and mistakes by law enforcement authorities doomed the prosecution of France's Dominique Strauss-Kahn after his arrest for alleged sexual assault of a hotel maid last year, a new book says.
"DSK. The Scandal That Brought Down Dominique Strauss Kahn," written by John Solomon and coming out June 5, paints the probe into the scandal in an unflattering light from the start.
For example, on his dramatic arrest May 14, police did not interview Strauss-Kahn, then the head of the International Monetary Fund, for more than six hours. Later that evening, his lawyer William Taylor told him not to speak to the police, meaning the authorities failed to get the politician's version of events.
The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, had only been in his job for 16 months, noted Solomon, who interviewed the chamber maid, Nafissatou Diallo, for Newsweek magazine.
Suddenly, "an inexperienced DA (was) thrust onto the biggest stage while still unprepared," Solomon wrote.
That inexperience explains the swings in the case, Solomon wrote, including the initial rush to judgment against Strauss-Kahn and the "overreaction in the other direction" when Diallo was revealed to have lied about her past.
Solomon also criticized the decision to replace the highly experienced sex crimes prosecutor Lisa Friel with two colleagues specialized in murder cases who "neither had the experience, the training or the temperament to deal with a complicated immigrant housekeeper and her assertive lawyer."
Prosecutors ultimately abandoned the case, saying that Diallo's credibility would not stand up in court.
Strauss-Kahn was seen as a likely winner of the French presidency before the scandal, but he was forced to resign from the IMF and his political career imploded.
