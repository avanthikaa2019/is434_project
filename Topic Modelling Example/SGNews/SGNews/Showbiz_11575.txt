A-Tai (Alan Kuo) has an estranged relationship with his father (Chen Po-cheng), the head of the Chiu-tien Din Tao troupe in Taichung.
He has to prove that he can rally the troupe members together while fending off his competitor, the arrogant A-hsien (Alien Huang).
Writer-director Fung Kai has genuine affection for the characters, but his handling of the story is often clunky.
