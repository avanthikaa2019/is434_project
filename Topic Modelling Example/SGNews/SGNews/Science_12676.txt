Recent Facebook-related crimes are exposing a number of less-than-intelligent criminals who use the social networking service.
Such was the case of two men in Colombia who recently robbed an Internet cafe. They waited until the time was ripe, held the owner at gunpoint, took the cash and made a clean getaway on a motorcycle.
They did everything right except for one thing; forgetting to log out of a Facebook account that had detailed information about one of the culprits, allowing police to simply walk up to his door and arrest him.
Three years ago, an American named Jonathan Parker broke into a house to steal jewelry, and logged onto Facebook on a computer inside the house.
Naturally he was caught and convicted.
These were not the only half-witted crimes linked to Facebook. It seems that some people cannot resist posting information on the site, even if it means giving away vital information about themselves.
Just last month, a man from Kentucky was arrested after posting a picture of himself stealing gas from a police car on Facebook.
Last year, a teen from the U.K. confessed to pulling a prank at a public library that resulted in US$247,000 (S$310,000) worth of damage. His confession came after he was presented with a transcript of his Facebook conversations with friends.
