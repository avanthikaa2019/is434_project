PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - A lack of sponsorship has brought down the curtains on the third season of the much-lauded local stage production P. Ramlee The Musical.
Produced by Datin Seri Tiara Jacquelina's Enfiniti Vision Media, the musical had been slated to run in Istana Budaya in November, following two successful stints in Kuala Lumpur and one in Singapore.
Tiara said in a statement yesterday that the musical could not be staged due to a lack of sponsorship, adding that a production of P. Ramlee The Musical's scale required substantial investments to stage.
"We spent over RM 4 million (S$1.6 million) to re-stage it in 2008 and a show of this scale needs to run for four to six months to break even through ticket sales but we are given less than three weeks per run, per season.
"Corporate and government funding and sponsorship are absolutely crucial for companies like ours to continue staging quality mega-musicals that contribute to the vibrancy of the local arts scene," she said.
P. Ramlee The Musical premiered in 2007, and scooped up six BOH Cameronian Arts Awards, including Best Director, Best Script, Best Set and Audience Choice. It has been watched by 60,000 people of all races and age groups.
Tiara said the decision to stage the show for the third time was made because P. Ramlee was a true Malaysian icon who appealed to audiences of all races and telling his story to the younger generation was a way of keeping his legend alive.
"We hope to be able to review the decision when there are confirmed sponsors for the project, so that we can continue staging quality local productions," she said.
Besides P. Ramlee The Musical, Enfiniti Vision Media has also staged Puteri Gunung Ledang The Musical and The Secret Life Of Nora.
