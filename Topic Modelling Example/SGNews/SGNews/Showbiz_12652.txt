Are these tomorrow's stars? New acting and hosting talents are currently being groomed by artiste management agency Aquila Emas.
They are Akhmar Ridhwan, Eva Emmanyna, Riaz Sopian, Azalea Firash and Saniza Sabran.
Eva, 27, a post-video production editor, is one of the more experienced ones.
Initially, Eva had been acting in short films for the past few years and thought that was enough to satisfy the thespian in her.
However, she soon changed her mind when she began acting in full length dramas.
"I then realised that doing short films was not enough for me. I need to do more," she says.
The country music fan has been busy acting for the past year, and still wants to learn even more under Aquila Emas.
"I did a few dramas and telefilms and acted in Zaiton Ceritaku, which should be out by the end of the year.
It's about the legendary singer Zaiton Sameon, who met with a tragic accident in the 90s.
"I play her manager's sister and I'm glad to be involved in a story about a woman of substance," she says.
However, Eva is one of the exceptions to the new talents being groomed by Aquila Emas, as she has some experience.
Azalea, 27, for one, is a newcomer to the industry.
However, the part-time model wants to challenge herself and broaden her experiences, through acting.
Saniza, 24 , is also a newcomer.
She decided to pack it in as a financial consultant after two years to pursue a career in acting.
"When I was financial consultant. I just couldn't wake up in the morning. I wasn't driven," says the Umie Aida fan.
Though she has little experience, she is still determined to be an actress.
"It's what I am passionate about. I spend hours practicing in front of the mirror. Now, with guidance from Aquila Emas, I want to learn the skill of acting," she says.
The agency has established artistes Zizan Nin, Juliana Ibrahim, Tony Eusoff, Ixora Chen, Diana Johor, Bill Azali and Rizal Ayub under its wing.
