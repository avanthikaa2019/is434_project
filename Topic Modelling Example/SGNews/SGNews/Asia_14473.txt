JAKARTA - Poverty and crime are the top two issues that Jakartans say the city administration needs to overcome within a year, a survey has revealed.
"The feeling of being prosperous and secure is steadily decreasing [among Jakartans]," Dirga Ardiansa, a researcher at the University of Indonesia's Center for Political Studies, said on Sunday as quoted by kompas.com.
"That's why these issues have become priorities that need immediate attention. They have to be dealt with within a year," he said in a press conference.
According to the survey, which was conducted between April 12-17, 62 per cent of 742 respondents agreed.
At least three-fourths of around 7 million eligible voters are expected to use their voting right in the July 11 gubernatorial elections.
Just as important, according to respondents, are the three main problems facing the city: traffic congestion, flooding and environmental issues, Dirga said.
However, respondents were more flexible, allowing Jakarta's leaders to overcome the three problems over two years, he said.
In a recent Indonesia Survey Circle poll, 52.6 per cent of a total of 440 respondents said they did not believe that the future governor could free the city from traffic congestion, flooding or waste problems.
The survey was conducted from March 26 to April 1.
