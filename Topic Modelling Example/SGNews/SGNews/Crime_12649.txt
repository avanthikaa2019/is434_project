KUALA LUMPUR - The wife of the mastermind in the kidnapping of 12-year-old Dutch national Nayati Shamelin Moodliar has lodged a police report denying any involvement in or knowledge of the crime.
It is learnt that the wife cut short her holiday with her husband while in Paris when she heard that the police were looking for her husband in connection with the kidnapping.
City CID chief Senior Asst Comm Datuk Ku Chin Wah said the wife returned two days ago and told the police that her husband was not returning.
"We have not arrested her but we are questioning her. She claimed that she was unaware of her husband's involvement in the kidnapping.
"No money or valuables have been recovered from her and she is assisting in investigations," he said, adding that Interpol was assisting in the search for the husband, who is said to be hiding in Europe.
It is learnt that the couple registered their marriage about a month ago.
Nayati was kidnapped by two men while walking to school on April 27.
He was released six days later after his family paid a RM300,000 (S$122,820) ransom.
Police have seized a Honda car believed to be used when Nayati was released and recovered part of the ransom money from seven people suspected to be involved in the kidnapping.
