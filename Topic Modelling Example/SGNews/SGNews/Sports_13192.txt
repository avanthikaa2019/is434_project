LONDON - West Brom skipper Chris Brunt will miss new England boss Roy Hodgson's final match in charge against Arsenal at the Hawthorns on Sunday after having his tonsils removed.
There are also doubts over leading scorer Peter Odemwingie and winger Jerome Thomas for the game which the Gunners need to win to secure a Champions League spot.
Brunt is hopeful of securing a place in the Great Britain Olympic squad. "We know Chris might be considered for the Great Britain team," said Albion number two coach Keith Downing.
"He has been stop-start with them (the tonsils) so the decision was taken to (remove them) now and it will give someone else the opportunity to play on Sunday."
Odemwingie (leg) and Thomas (illness) are also battling to be fit to face Arsene Wenger's side.
Downing said: "Peter is doing rehab to try and get back before the weekend while Jerome has been out for the past couple of days with a virus."
