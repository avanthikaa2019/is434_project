China Press reported that So Sze Wong, a popular TV host and DJ in Hong Kong, has revealed she is a lesbian.
The So Good host made the confession at a late night radio programme.
Asked by a priest, who was also a guest on the programme, if she would tell her parents, Wong raised her voice: "How to tell? Tell them I'm a lesbian? You straight people will never understand!"
Nevertheless, she thanked her family and good friends, who accepted her as she was.
"In this world, I thank my parents, siblings and friends. I never talked about it but they all accepted me. I appreciate, because of love," said So.
