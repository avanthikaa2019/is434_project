SINGAPORE - Worker's Party (WP) member Dr Poh Lee Guan, who applied and received a political donation certificate despite his no-show during nomination day, told the media today that he was just the 'spare' candidate for his party for the Hougang by-election.
However, he claimed it was unofficial, and had not informed WP of his decision as he was too busy.
WP told reporters that there was no intention on the party's side for Dr Poh, 50, to be a back-up.
In response, Dr Poh said that while WP's statement was the 'official' source, he maintained that he collected the donation certificate with the intention to be a back-up.
Dr Poh is a veteran member of WP. He was part of the five-member team which contested Nee Soon GRC in last year's General Election.
In the lead-up to nomination day, Dr Poh's application for a donation certificate had sparked off rumours of a rift within WP.
However, WP chief Low Thia Khiang told reporters that the entire WP is behind Hougang candidate Png Eng Huat, and that there "is no split or internal strife in WP."
