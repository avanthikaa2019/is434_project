KUALA LUMPUR - A former police officer who was about to celebrate his birthday with friends, was arrested for allegedly masterminding the kidnapping of a businessman.
The man was among six people arrested in Rawang and Kajang soon after they had collected a RM300,000 ransom from the businessman's family.
According to sources, the 34-year-old businessman was kidnapped on March 22 at his business premises in Seri Kembangan.
The kidnappers contacted the victim's father and demanded a RM1.5mil ransom which was reduced to RM300,000 (S$123,060) after several negotiations.
They had asked for the money to be dropped off in Rawang at about midnight yesterday.
A team of police officers from Bukit Aman's serious crimes division and the Selangor police contingent laid an ambush and staked out the drop-off point as well as the main roads and highways in the area.
The police trailed and nabbed the kidnappers after they had collected the ransom and released the victim at about 8.30am.
A police forensic team was checking to ensure if the money recovered was part of the ransom.
