Hot on the heels of The Woman In Black, this set-in-the-1920s film takes the genre of Brit horror one notch higher by using supernatural scares as a means of venturing into psychological-thriller territory.
In the fine company of co-stars like Dominic West and Imelda Staunton, The Town's Rebecca Hall is superb as a stoical disbeliever out to disprove ghostly manifestations, whose investigation into a student's mysterious death at a boarding school unlocks repressed memories.
