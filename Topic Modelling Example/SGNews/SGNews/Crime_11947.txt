SINGAPORE - A 43-year-old woman suffered first degree burns to more than 80 per cent of her body when her former lover allegedly set her on fire on Friday morning.
She died late Friday night.
Lim Ghim Peow, 44, is being charged with the death of Ms Hsiung Wei Ling, 43, at her uncle's home in Sengkang.
According to The Straits Times, the police and Singapore Civil Defence Force received a call for help at about 8.30am Friday.
When they arrived at the scene at Block 206B, Compassvale Lane, the blaze had been put out but three people had been injured : Ms Hsiung, her cousin Phua Duan Kai, 32, and Lim.
Neighbours reported seeing the man earlier outside the family's flat on the 14th floor splashing kerosene on the door.
One neighbour, Mr Guo, 47, told The New Paper that he was woken up by loud shouting, and saw flames coming out from the neighbouring unit.
A man was standing ouside shouting: "My wife is inside!"
He got his family to help put out the fire by throwing pails of water on the burning gate and door.
Hearing a commotion, her younger cousin rushed in to the flat to rescue Ms Hsiung and got burnt in the process.
Mr Guo said he saw a badly-burnt Ms Xiong emerging from the flat wrapped in a towel.
According to the victim's uncle, Mr Phua, 60, his niece had been together with the man for three years and were living together before they broke up.
She had then left her Hougang home to go to Malaysia in order to avoid Lim.
However, she had returned to Singapore a few days ago to vote in the Hougang by-election yesterday.
Lim tracked her down and allegedly set fire to the Sengkang flat when she rejected his advances, ST reported.
The suspect was also injured and suffered second degree burns to his limbs.
Her cousin was sent to the Singapore General Hospital's burns unit in critical condition.
Ms Hsiung suffered burns to 86 per cent of her body, and died at 11.05pm.
