KUALA LUMPUR - Two neighbours were jailed a total of 75 years for raping two underage girls who were able to give graphic details of the incidents.
Burger seller Aidil Rashid, 36, was guilty of two counts of rape while car insurance agent Lee Kwong Mun, 38, of three counts.
They had lured the girls into having sex in exchange for prepaid phone top-ups on various occasions in 2010.
Ampang Sessions judge Roszianayati Ahmad said she believed the victims' testimony as they could give detailed accounts of the incidents. The judge found the accused's defence to be mere denial.
She ruled that Aidil and Lee deserved a deterrent sentence as they had lured the girls - aged 13 and 14 at the time - by promising them prepaid top-up cards. The accused had claimed trial to five charges of raping the girls in a flat in Taman Industri in Lembah Jaya at various dates in 2010.
During the trial, it was revealed that in addition to the top-up cards, Lee had also paid the girls RM30 (S$12.15) in exchange for sex on several occasions.
DPP Nordalina Ali said Lee had even ordered the girls to "jalan itik" (walk while squatting) when entering his flat to avoid being seen by neighbours. The court sentenced Aidil to 15 years and two strokes for each of the two offences. Lee received 15 years and two strokes for each of his three offences.
The court ordered the sentences to run concurrently.
Counsel Datuk Dr Mohd Radzuan Ibrahim requested for a stay of execution pending an appeal.
Judge Roszianayati allowed for the stay, but raised bail from RM16,000 to RM25,000 (S$10,127) for each man.
