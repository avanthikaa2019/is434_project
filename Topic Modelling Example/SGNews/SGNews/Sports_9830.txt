GOALKEEPER ZAKARIAH NERANI (Balestier Khalsa)
PROVED his coach right for picking him over Joey Sim, who was called up to the national team. Was solid in Balestier's 1-0 win over Home and pulled off a fantastic save from a Qiu Li free-kick.
DEFENDER ISMADI MUKHTAR (Tampines Rovers)
THE wingback was sound defensively - he coped well with the threat of speedy DPMM winger Helmi Zambin - and also provided width going forward.
DEFENDER TALES DOS SANTOS (Brunei DPMM)
TAMPINES' 90th-minute winner was cruel on the big Brazilian stopper, who showed great strength in getting the better of top striker Aleksandar Duric time and again.
DEFENDER STANISLAV VIDAKOVIC (Hougang United)
THE CROATIAN has been solid for most of his team's campaign so far, and was instrumental in helping the Cheetahs keep a clean sheet as they beat Tanjong Pagar 1-0.
MIDFIELDER GLIGOR GLIGOROV (Tampines Rovers)
HAS taken time to settle, but is looking a handy player for the Stags. Decent set-piece taker, packs a powerful shot, and netted the winner against DPMM.
DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER SHAFUAN SUTOHMOH (Balestier Khalsa)
MAKING his first appearance since moving from Gombak in the mid-season window, Shafuan produced a solid, no-frills performance in defensive midfield as Balestier beat Home 1-0.
MIDFIELDER ATSUSHI SHIMONO (Albirex Niigata)
THE Ponytailed One was involved in his side's final two goals - starting the move for the equaliser and netting the winner himself - as they beat SAFFC 4-3.
WINGER FARIS RAMLI (Courts Young Lions)
BARELY 48 hours' since returning from the regional finals of Nike's The Chance competition in Jakarta, Faris lasted 90 minutes and scored the winner in his side's 2-1 win over Woodlands.
FORWARD MISLAV KAROGLAN (SAFFC)
HE JUST loves scoring against Albirex. His brace last week means he has now scored seven goals in as many games against the Japanese side. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough as the Warriors fell 4-3.
FORWARD YASUHIRO YAMAKOSHI (Albirex Niigata)
SUPER-SUB of the week: The Albirex No.9 scored the equaliser before laying the winner on a plate for Shimono with a clever pass deep in injury time.
WINGER ZULKIFFLI HASSIM (Balestier Khalsa)
SPEEDY Gonzulez has been in sparkling form this season, and had another good outing against Home. A constant threat with his pace, he also scored the only goal of the game.
