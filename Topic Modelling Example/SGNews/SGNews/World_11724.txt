LYON, France - Global police agency Interpol Tuesday launched a website to educate teenagers about crimes that can be committed over the Internet and tell them how they can protect themselves from the dangers.
"Every day, Interpol works with police around the world to fight all types of crime, and we have seen the increasing dangers posed to the public, and especially young people, through crimes committed via the Internet," said Roraima Andriani, a senior agency official who oversaw the project.
"Interpol's new educational website enables us to share the knowledge and expertise we have developed with our member countries to help children become better informed on how to protect themselves," she said.
The new website also aims to teach teenagers about the 190-country-member organisation that is based in this French city in the foothills of the Alps.
A focal point of the new site is a game "Interpol Junior Officer - the Case of the Black Tattoo," in which players assume the role of an Interpol officer who travels worldwide, gathering clues to help local police track down an international gang involved in smuggling.
The website was launched in English and will eventually have Arabic, French and Spanish versions.
