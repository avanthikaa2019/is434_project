SINGAPORE - A Filipino maid died after a church lift fell on her in a freak accident at the Catholic Church of St Michael off Serangoon Road, The Straits Times (ST) reported.
Ms Clarita Abanes, 46, was on the ground floor of the four-storey church helping a 70-year-old woman enter the lift when the accident occurred on the evening of May 16.
She was going to the second floor for mass, her friends and relatives said.
According to Ms Abanes' cousin, who gave her name as Ms Logie, it was likely that Ms Abanes did not notice that the lift had not descended to touch the ground floor when she pulled open the glass doors of the lift.
The lift then fell on both Ms Abanes and the elderly woman and trapped them underneath.
Ms Logie said that the glass door can be manually pulled open only when the lift has arrived at the designated floor, and expressed puzzlement as to why the doors were able to be opened in the first place.
Ms Abanes was seriously injured and died last Thursday after being in a coma. The unnamed elderly woman has been hospitalised but is conscious now.
She was given a send-off in the same church on Monday.
Donations are being collected by foreign worker welfare group Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics for her family.
