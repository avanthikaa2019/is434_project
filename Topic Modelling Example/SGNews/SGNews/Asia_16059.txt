PHNOM PENH - Myanmar President Thein Sein said on Tuesday the country's by-elections at the weekend, which were swept by the opposition, were carried out successfully.
"It was conducted in a very successful way," the retired general told reporters during a summit of Association of South East Asian Nation leaders in Cambodia, his first public comment on Sunday's elections for vacant parliamentary seats.
Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a landslide in the vote, a victory she hailed as a "triumph of the people" after decades of military dictatorship.
Her party won 40 of the 45 seats being contested, the Election Commission announced on state television, dealing a crushing blow to a ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP)created by the former military junta.
Thein Sein's USDP still holds most of parliament's 664 seats, thanks to 2010 elections held while Suu Kyi was in detention and her party boycotted the polls.
