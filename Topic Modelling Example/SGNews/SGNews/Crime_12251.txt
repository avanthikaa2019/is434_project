Three friends were charged with kidnapping 12-year-old Dutch national Nayati Moodliar last month.
The accused - clad in T-shirts, shorts and slippers - did not show much reaction when they were brought to the magistrate's court in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
Self-employed Chong Tat Siong, 23, handphone seller Foong Khar Fai, 19, unemployed Lee Phak Seng, 23, and another still at large, were accused with kidnapping the boy with the intent to get RM300,000 (S$122,820) ransom.
The offence was alleged to have been committed at Jalan Kiara 1, Mont Kiara here at about 7.30pm on April 27.
The trio were charged under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961, which carries a death penalty or life imprisonment and possible whipping if spared the death penalty, upon conviction.
Prosecuting was DPP Faizah Mohd Salleh while Rajinder Singh acted for Chong and Foong while Lee was unrepresented.
The court has fixed July 20 for mention.
Nayati was on his way to Mont' Kiara International school near his home when he was abducted by two men in a black car. He was released at the Sungai Buloh rest and recreation area on May 3.
