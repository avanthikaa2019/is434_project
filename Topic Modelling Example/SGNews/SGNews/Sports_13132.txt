SHANGHAI - Malaysian football prodigy Tam Sheang Tsung has scored by becoming the first player below 20 to be promoted to the first team of Shanghai Shenhua Football Club.
This was after a five-month training stint and trial at the club, which saw him being drafted into the first team of 44 players, which includes Nicolas Anelka, who last played for Chelsea.
The 17-year-old left winger, who was born in Tokyo but still holds a Malaysian passport, will now have to fight for a place in the starting line-up to become the first Malaysian to play in the Chinese Super League.
Tam was introduced to the team by Anelka, who is the player-coach of the club, at a press conference at Shenhua's training base here yesterday.
Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba has also been linked to Shenhua but is likely to stay on with English Premiership side Chelsea.
