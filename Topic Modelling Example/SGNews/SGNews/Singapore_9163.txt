Electricity tariff for households will decrease by 2.4 per cent from Sunday, July 1.
This will work out to about $2.69 less a month for a family living in a four-room HDB flat, The Straits Times reported.
The reduction will last until the end of September - the second price reduction in the last nine months.
Previously, there was an increase of 4.3 per cent, or $4.18 more for the same household.
This makes the tariff 28.08 cents/kilowatt now.
It had hit 30.45 cents at its recent peak in October 2008 while it was at its lowest in January 2002 at 15.02 cents.
This fall in prices is due to lower natural gas prices in recent months, Singapore Power said.
