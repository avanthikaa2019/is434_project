SINGAPORE - When Singapore's biggest garden opens in the heart of the city, entry will be free for all visitors, however those wanting to access the glass-domed conservatories will have to pay a small premium.
The first section to open on June 29 is the 54ha Bay South Garden, featuring highlights like the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, Supertree Grove and Kingfisher lake.
Fees are tagged at $28 for entry to both conservatories for non-resident adults and $15 for non-resident children.
But the good news for locals is that they get to enjoy reduced rates of $8-$20. There is a separate charge for entry to the aerial walkway at $5 for adults and $3 for children.
There is also an annual pass which allows unlimited visits over a 12-month period. A family pass for two adults and three children costs $180, an adult pass $68 and a senior citizen pass $60.
The rationale for this is to encourage those who live here to make repeat visits, said Gardens by the Bay chief executive Tan Wee Kiat.
The Straits Times (ST) reported that the soon-to-be-opened Gardens is the first major publicly funded attraction to levy differing entry fees on local residents and foreigners.
According to the report, the only other major attraction with daily differential pricing for local residents and foreigners is the ArtScience Museum at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) integrated resort, which also does it for the same reason - to make it more accessible to them and to spur return visits.
Other attractions such as the Night Safari, Singapore Science Centre and Singapore Flyer, do not have rates that distinguish locals from foreigners. Instead, they have concessions for specific groups like the elderly and students.
