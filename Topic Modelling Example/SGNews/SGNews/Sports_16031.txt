Singapore's LionsXII team reached the top of the Malaysian Super League after a 4-2 victory over Negeri Sembilan at the Stadium Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Paroi last night.
The sparkling win gave them 27 points from 13 matches, one more point than Kelantan, who have played two fewer games.
Against Negeri, the defending Malaysian Cup champions, the Lions took control after a frantic first half filled with scoring chances.
In the 14th minute, Madhu Mohana's long throw caused confusion amid the Negeri defence, and Safuwan Baharudin pounced on the loose ball to open accounts for the Lions.
Within six minutes, they were 2-0 ahead, as Khairul Nizam took advantage of more shoddy defending by Negeri to slot home.
Negeri pulled a goal back in the 32nd minute when defender G. Mahathevan scored from close range, but Lions captain Shahril Ishak continued his superb scoring form with a clinical strike in the 41st minute to make it 3-1.
Shahdan Sulaiman made it 4-1 in the 70th minute, tapping home from a Hariss Harun pass, before Negeri captain Shukor Adam completed the scoring with four minutes left.
