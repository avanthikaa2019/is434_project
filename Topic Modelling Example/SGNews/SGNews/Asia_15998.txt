Law and Human Rights Deputy Minister Denny Indrayana denied ongoing news reporting that he allegedly had slapped a prison guard during a spontaneous inspection at Pekanbaru Penitentiary in Riau on Monday morning.
Speaking before reporters at his office in South Jakarta on Tuesday, the former adviser to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono admitted that he was "shocked by the height of media coverage over the slapping incident".
He also lamented the continuing news, claiming that he does not have the "look" to assault other people.
"The news claiming that I had slapped a penitentiary guard is unsubstantiated. Can you imagine a guy with a face like me could do such things?" Denny said as quoted by tempo.co.
The inspection reportedly happened at Pekanbaru Penitentiary in Riau on Monday morning. The deputy minister Denny was accompanied by several members of the National Narcotics Agency (BNN).
Commenting on this, Denny confirmed that one of the inspection officers accompanying him beat the prison guard. He said that it took a long time for the guard to open the main door to the penitentiary.
"We had to wait for at least six minutes. We do apologize for the incident, but not because I was the one who assaulted anyone," he said.
