MONTREAL - Lewis Hamilton admitted his surprise at second place on the grid after struggling for grip during qualifying for Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix.
The 27-year-old McLaren driver, who dominated the opening day in Montreal, found it difficult to adjust to Saturday's warmer track temperatures at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit and wound up over a third of a second slower than pole-taker German Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull.
'It was definitely a bit harder for us today,' he said. 'We struggled working with the tyres, we were trying really hard to get the tyres to switch on, but fortunately we had a new set in Q3 and managed to get through.
'I'm happy with performance, and surprised to see us on the front row, but we will be trying as hard as we can tomorrow.'
