KUALA LUMPUR - Actor-singer Ramin Karimloo gained world acclaim as the disfigured musical genius who terrorised the Paris Opera House to win the love of a young protge in the West End staging of Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic musical The Phantom Of The Opera.
The Iranian-born Canadian performer is meeting Malaysians in An Evening With The Phantom at a gala dinner here on June 21 and June 22 at the JW Marriot Hotel.
The hotel's ballroom will be lavishly decorated to evoke the la belle epoque ( beautiful era) of Paris from 1890 to 1910, when the original novel Le Fantme de l'Opra by Gaston Leroux was first published.
The guest artiste is Australian opera singer Annalisa Kerriga.
One of the highlights of the evening will be a duet between them as the Phantom and his love interest, Christine.
Karimloo, 34, will also perform selections from South Pacific and Man Of La Mancha.
He made his debut on the Malaysian stage last April when he performed alongside Stephen Rahman-Hughes and Simon Bailey in West End Stars In Concert at Istana Budaya.
Karimloo has appeared in the West End production of The Phantom of the Opera from September 2007, performing as the show's 21st anniversary Phantom.
Last October, he made three performances in the 25th anniversary production of the show at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall in London, which was streamed live to theatres across the world.
He has also appeared in Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, Jesus Christ Superstar and The Pirates Of Penzance.
Tickets for the black-tie event are available at RM1,000 (S$410) per seat or RM10,000 per table.
