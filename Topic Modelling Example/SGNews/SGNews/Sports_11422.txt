Singapore will not be at their strongest when they play Malaysia in an international double-header next week, dealing a blow to national coach K. Rajagobal's plans for his side to be given a proper test.
Six key players of the Singapore team will not be able to travel to Shah Alam for the second leg of the two-match series on June 12 after being denied permission to leave the country by the republic's Defence Ministry.
Hariss Harun, Safuwan Baharudin, Shakir Hamzah, Khairul Nizam, Yasir Hanapi and Shaffiq Ghani, all national service trainees, will not play Malaysia in the second match having also missed Singapore's away match against Hong Kong yesterday.
Malaysia played Philippines yesterday and will meet Singapore at the Jalan Besar Stadium on Friday, though the Singaporeans should be at full-strength for this match.
Ahead of the departure for Hong Kong, Singapore coach Radojko Avramovic lamented the fact that he has to make do with a makeshift squad.
"It's a squad without their best players. What to do?
"We cannot take our best players for an international match," Avramovic told Singaporean reporters on the sidelines of a friendly match between his team and the Singapore Under-22 squad at Jalan Besar which the seniors won 2-1 on Tuesday.
The same problem has afflicted Singapore's LionsXII squad for Super League away games where they are regularly short-handed whenever travelling to Malaysia.
A Malaysian win over Singapore in Shah Alam would certainly have the gloss taken off now that the visitors will be fielding a second-string side.
