SINGAPORE - The flying fox ride at Sentosa's MegaZip attraction has been given the green light by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to resume operations.
The closure order was lifted on May 16 after the safety modifications carried out by the adventure operator had been deemed "satisfactory".
MegaZip had been shut down by BCA in Sept last year following an accident where a patron was injured and hospitalised.
On Sept 11, Australian tourist Michael Joseph McCarthy, 38, broke several vertebrae in his back when the zipline he was riding failed to stop.
In Dec 2011, BCA issued a written order to the operator, Flying Dragon Adventure, to modify the ride to enhance patrons' safety.
While the flying fox ride was closed, the other three obstacle challenges - ClimbMax, ParaJump and NorthFace - at the adventure park remained unaffected.
Some of key modifications include two new zip lines, a new primary braking system and a secondary braking system.
