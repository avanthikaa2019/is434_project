KOTA SAMARAHAN, Malaysia - Gullible and vulnerable students in institutions of higher learning have been warned "to be more cautious of their newfound Facebook and Twitter friends".
State Welfare, Women and Family Development Minister Datuk Fatimah Abdullah said social networking sites were now the drug syndicates' "new hunting grounds" for drug mules.
"Drug syndicates are targeting students of institutions of higher learning to become drug mules. Students have become victims after being trapped in love affairs," she said at a talk on women as drug mules and sexual violence against women organised by Women Against Crime at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, here recently.
Fatimah said most of the women who became victims were naive and were easily lured by the sweet talk and promises of things like marriage, overseas trips, luxurious goods and money.
She pointed out that up till March last year, 158 women were detained in various countries for trying to smuggle drugs.
