The National Addictions Manage- ment Service, part of the Insti- tute of Mental Health, announced a new online site to help prob- lem gamblers yesterday.
The www.nams.sg/workbook site aims to help them understand their gambling behaviour and offers tips for saying no to gambling.
A programme was also rolled out to educate families about issues, such as how they can help family members who are problem gamblers.
