A newly married young Singaporean couple have been killed in a traffic accident in New Zeland on Friday.
Singapore's Berita Minggu newspaper had reported that Lieutenant Mohamed Najibullah Suhaimi, 26, and Ms Raihana Mohd Rashid, 25, were believed to have died on the spot at Mangatawhiri, south of Auckland, after a two-vehicle crash.
They were married in Singapore on June 7 and left for New Zealand for their honeymoon on Monday.
Lt Mohamed Najibullah was with the Singapore Armed Forces, while Ms Raihana was a nurse at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.
New Zealand media reports said the accident on State Highway 2 in Mangatawhiri occurred at about 1.20pm.
It is known as one of the most deadly stretches of road in the country, with 30 deaths since 2001.
The speed limit there was recently reduced to 90kmh, down from 100kmh.
The Sunday Times reported that the car was driven by one of the Singaporeans and had apparently lost control and hit a van.
The passengers in the van were unhurt.
Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the incident and have extended their condolences to the families of the two Singaporeans who have died.
A ministry spokesman said they are in contact with their next-of-kin in Singapore and will continue to provide all necessary assistance to them.
The father of Ms Raihana, who met Berita Minggu at his home in Tampines yesterday, said that the last time he spoke to his daughter was two days ago, when he was about to leave for a trip to Penang.
She was the second child in a family of five.
Mr Mohamed Najibullah was the youngest of three siblings.
His mother, Madam Julaiha Ismail, 64, told Berita Minggu that her son called on Thursday, and sounded very happy.
The couple's remains are reported to be flown home to Singapore tomorrow.
