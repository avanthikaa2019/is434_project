Gigolos men who escort women for sexual favours are being offered for hire by a sex syndicate in Singapore via phone messages, Sin Chew Daily reported.
The promotion is accompanied by images of naked men, claimed to be from China, Vietnam and Thailand, and prospective clients are given the option of getting a "massage" from them.
However, the message that is supposed to reach only women and said to be sent out at random has also reached men.
One receiver, known only as Yen, complained to the media that he and his male friends had also received the message that is believed to have started circulating two weeks ago.
