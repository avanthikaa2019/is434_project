ROME - Lazio boss Edy Reja believes that second-placed Juventus will overtake leaders AC Milan to win this season's Serie A crown, even though his side could have a major say in deciding the championship.
Milan are currently two points ahead of Juve in the Italian league having played an extra game but that could all change when the Old Lady of Turin take on third-placed Lazio on Wednesday night.
But even though his team could stop Antonio Conte's Juve from winning the league, Reja believes the bianconeri will triumph come May.
"They have character, quality and temperament and I think they will stay top right to the end," he said.
"Milan have many injuries and they don't have many options to replace players while Juve have been able to prepare without the midweek European commitments."
Reja paid tribute to Conte for his tactical acumen, likening the young coach to himself a few years ago.
"I have to congratulate Conte. He's given mental strength and a new philosophy to the team which is in fact a 3-5-2 formation like the one I used at Napoli for which people accused me of being too old.
"They're very good on the flanks, they have a lot of quality in attack and midfielders who get invovled."
Lazio lost at home to Juve earlier in the season but they took four points off Milan in their two games.
They are 11 points behind Juve and three ahead of the chasers trying to snatch the final Champions League qualifying berth from them.
