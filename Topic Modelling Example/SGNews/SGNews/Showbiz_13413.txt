Galaxy Express, one of South Korea's leading indie rock bands, turned down the chance to perform in the United States two years ago.
"We were asked to participate in a project called SeoulSonic designed to bring South Korean rock groups to North America. But we said, 'No. Why do we have to? We are already doing great and are busy here,' " said Park Jong Hyun, the Hongdae-based band's guitarist and vocalist.
But, in March last year, the band relented. And this year, the band - known for their brand of garage punk and psychedelic sounds - took a bigger step forward. The trio performed at the famous South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.
This time, the band not only wowed serious rock fans there, but also grabbed the mainstream media's attention. The New York Times ran a photo of the group performing.
"We were so surprised to see hundreds of people coming to our show. Some were even wearing T-shirts with our names on them," said bassist Lee Ju Hyun.
"People said that they realise that our music is a kind of rock. But they said ours is so unique and distinctive from what they've heard," he added.
The band also performed in front of Culture Minister Choe Kwang Shik last month at a press conference, at which it was announced that the South Korean government intends to turn the Korean wave into a global industry.
The comprehensive plan includes plans for Seoul to host the first Asian Music Market in October at various venues. There, the event will feature not only K-pop artists, but also the country's talented, yet unknown, indie bands.
The ministry also plans to support indie bands that want to make inroads into overseas markets.
"The Japanese government has been supporting rock bands for the last 20 years. It is quite late for the South Korean government to do so. But we hope that the government continues its support, to open more opportunities for bands like us," said Galaxy Express drummer Kim Hee Kwon.
