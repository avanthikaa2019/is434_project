Halle Berry is going to be US$20,000 (S$25,000) poorer every month from now.
After a court appearance earlier this week, the 45-year-old US actress has been ordered by a judge to fork out that amount for child support payments to her ex-boyfriend, French-Canadian model Gabriel Aubry.
The former couple, who split in 2010, have been locked in a custody battle over their four-year-old daughter, Nahla.
Aubry filed legal documents asking Berry, who's now engaged to French actor Olivier Martinez,for the stipulated sum to accommodate a long list of expenses, including clothing and a "proper home" for Nahla.
