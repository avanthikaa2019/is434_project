SINGAPORE - The Singapore Maritime Week (SMW) 2012 was officially launched today by Mr Lui Tuck Yew, Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs at VivoCity.
As part of the launch, several public outreach activities were organised by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).
This morning, over 800 participants from all walks of life participated in the Amazing Maritime Challenge, where nine maritime-themed game stations were set up in and around the Maritime Experiential Museum in Sentosa.
The two winning teams of the challenge completed all nine stations in less than five hours and walked away with $1,500 and $800 in cash respectively.
The prizes were given out by Minister Lui, who also honoured the winners of the 'Your Colourful World of Containers' design competition.
The design competition - organised by MPA in partnership with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) - saw a total of 466 entries for both the NAFA Category and the Open category.
The winner of the Open Category was Ms Liew Chia Chyun. Her entry, titled '"A" to "Z" ingredients for Singapore, was an illustration of 26 items from A to Z carried in containers that is needed for nation building and creating a successful business hub.
All winning and shortlisted container design entries were on display at the 'Walk through Maritime Singapore' exhibition at VivoCity which ended today.
The exhibition attracted more than 18,000 visitors with its display of container designs, interactive panels illustrating various facets of Maritime Singapore, and the fun activity corners.
"We hope that through these activities, we are able to share with the wider community about Singapore's dynamic and exciting maritime sector," said Mr Lam Yi Young, Chief Executive of MPA.
Coming up, SMW 2012 will see a line-up of conferences, meetings, dialogues and networking events that celebrate and showcase the diversity and vibrancy of the Singapore maritime industry.
