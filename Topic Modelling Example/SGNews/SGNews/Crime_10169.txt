Two sisters who have represented Singapore in cricket, Vigineswari Pasupathy, 22, and Rajeswari Pasupathy, 24, have been slapped with more housebreaking charges.
The sisters and a school cricket coach, Jeraj Puvaneshen, 26, were charged in court earlier this month with housebreaking on May 17.
With the new charges on Friday, the women are now accused of taking more than $68,000 worth of items after allegedly breaking into three different homes.
The trio's original charges were also amended.
Jeraj is now accused of instigating the sisters to commit housebreaking.
He allegedly distracted a man, Mr Pradhiv Janarthanan, at St Andrew's Secondary School at Francis Thomas Drive near Potong Pasir on May 17.
The sisters allegedly got hold of Mr Pradhiv's house keys and later broke into a flat at Block 567, Hougang Street 51, and made off with $20,000 in valuables.
They are also said to have broken into a flat in Block 154, Serangoon North Avenue 1, around 1pm on Dec 21, 2009.
They allegedly made off with more than $35,000 in cash and valuables there.
About an hour later, Jeraj allegedly helped to dispose of 21 pieces of gold jewellery which he allegedly knew to be stolen property at Jin Huang 1st Jewellery Shop at Eu Tong Sen Street.
The 15 gold bangles and six gold rings are worth about $10,200.
The sisters also allegedly broke into a flat in Block 116, Serangoon North Avenue 1, and stole valuables worth more than $13,000 around 1.30pm on Sept 30, 2010.
The trio, who are out on $20,000 bail each, will be back in court on June 29.
Anyone convicted of housebreaking to commit theft can be jailed up to 10 years.
