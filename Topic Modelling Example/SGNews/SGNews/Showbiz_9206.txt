Has Malaysia's first top model Amber Chia, winner of the Guess Watches Timeless Beauty International Model Search 2004 and headmaster of her own modelling school, discovered the fountain of youth? Amber believes every woman wants to be forever 21-and she's got the key.
"If you feel young at heart, you'll look young. If you think you're old, you'll look old. I'm 21 in the heart," said the 31-year-old mum of one, sounding more like Deepak Chopra than a model who posed for Playboy Indonesia six years ago-but not in the nude, mind you.
Amber added that you could still feel young even if you were a mother. "It's how you feel inside, that's what I tell my friends who are mummies."
"I enjoy motherhood. It's the best thing in my life," said the tall and skinny girl from Ipoh, getting all mushy as she started talking about her son-even imitating his baby talk. "Ashton is getting really adorable. He can talk a lot now."
Daily Chilli spoke to Amber at the opening of the Forever 21 two-storey flagship store at Mid Valley Megamall in KL. For those who don't want to be wallflowers, the American fashion retailer has loads of bold tartans and floral prints. The massive outlet also offers labels like Love 21, Heritage 1981 and Forever 21 Girls aimed at pre-teens.
Other celebrities at the event included Sarimah Ibrahim, actress Siti Saleha, Miss Universe Malaysia 2010 Nadine Ann Thomas, and models Wafe De Korte and Kelly Jagan.
