A 52-year-old man who murdered a property agent in 2008 was sentenced to a 12-year preventive detention on Friday.
Rosli Yassin, initially faced the death penalty in 2010, had pleaded guilty to a reduced charged of culpable homicide, according to reports.
He met with 47-year-old agent Mdm Choo Xue Ying on Oct 16, 2008.
Mdm Choo, who was driving, stopped the car at Lorong Sesuai to discuss some business. The Straits Times reported that they started arguing. When Mdm Choo threatened to call the police, he grabbed her phone, and punched and kicked her.
Rosli took her handbag and carried her to the bottom of the slope and drove away in her car. Her body was found a few days later by a jogger, according to reports.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Lau Wing Yum had argued for Rosli to be sentenced to 20 years of preventive detention as he posed a high risk of re-offending.
Rosli committed offences in 2007 and 2008, despite serving eight years of preventive detention in 1999, according to reports.
According to The Straits Times, Rosli also pleaded guilty to seven other charges related to cheating, criminal breach of trust and abetting forgery.
