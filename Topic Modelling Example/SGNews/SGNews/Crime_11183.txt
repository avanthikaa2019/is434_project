A grassroots leader was given a jail sentence of 18 months on Tuesday after pleading guilty to molesting a six-year-old boy.
A district court heard that Kelvin Chan Kum Poh, 31, then a volunteer committee member of Bishan East Sports Community Sports Centre (CSC) and Youth Executive Club met the six-year-old victim at a video game arcade in Woodlands on Oct 1, 2010.
Wanting to bring him to a basketball session as he needed young players, he asked permission from the victim's grandmother who eventually agreed. He also showed her his grassroots' leaders' card, reported The Straits Times.
Instead of bringing the boy back to his grandmother after a basketball clinic session at the Bishan East CSC and YEC, Chan brought him back to his Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 flat to molest him.
The grandmother filed a police report in April last year, after the boy told her what had happened.
The paper reported that according to the Institute of Mental Health, Chan may have paedophiliac tendencies.
For his crime, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or a combination of the three.
