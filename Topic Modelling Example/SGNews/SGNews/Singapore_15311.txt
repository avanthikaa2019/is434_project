SINGAPORE - A 32-year-old Nigerian man believed to be involved in an Internet love scam here was extradited to Singapore from Malaysia on Wednesday.
The Airport Police Division established his identity with the help of the Royal Malaysia Police, who arrested the suspect in Kuala Lumpur on Monday.
The police said that a spate of Internet love scams was reported last year.
In the cases, the male culprits - believed to be foreigners - befriended female victims through online dating and social-networking sites.
As part of their modus operandi, the culprits developed a "romantic" relationship with their victims and promised to visit Singapore.
On the supposed date of their arrival here, they would contact their victims, saying they had been detained at one of the immigration checkpoints.
They would then ask the victims to remit money to specified bank accounts to secure their release.
Police statistics released in February showed that the number of Internet love-scam cases - which surfaced in 2008 - almost tripled to 62 last year, from 21 in 2010.
The amount of money scammed increased from $824,000 in 2010 to $2.3 million last year.
