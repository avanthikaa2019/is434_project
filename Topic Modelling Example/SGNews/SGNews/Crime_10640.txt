SINGAPORE - Police have arrested a mother and her son for providing false contact information when obtaining loans from loansharks.
On June 11, 2012 at about 7.55 pm, police officers arrested a 50-year-old woman and her 29-year-old son in the vicinity of Sengkang Square.
Preliminary investigations revealed that suspects are debtors who had used their former residential address to obtain illegal loans from loansharks.
Their actions resulted in loanshark harassment to the current owners of their former residence.
Further investigation revealed that the suspects had also failed to report the change of their residential address and thus, they will also be liable for an offence under the National Registration Act.
Investigations against the suspects are ongoing.
If they are convicted, they face a prison term of up to 12 months for giving a false address to loansharks.
Under the National Registration Act, if found guilty of failing to report a change of address, the duo face a fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to five years, or both.
The police warned that they take a serious view of individuals who seek loans from illegal moneylenders using their old addresses, resulting in inconvenience and distress to the innocent parties.
