SINGAPORE - A woman was found dead in the vicinity of Raffles City shopping centre on Sunday morning.
Police received a call for assistance at about 4am, said a local news source.
The woman, believed to be in her mid-20s, was found lying motionless on the third floor parapet near Starbucks.
According to the report, officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force had to use safety harnesses and rescue lines to get to the woman.
In the process, her body apparently slipped to the ground when the parapet, made of thin metal sheet, gave way.
Paramedics declared the woman dead shortly after.
It is unclear if the woman was already found dead or she died from the impact of the fall.
Police have classified the case as unnatural death.
