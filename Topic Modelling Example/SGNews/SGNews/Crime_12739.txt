SHAH ALAM, Malaysia - A telecommunications company engineer managed to snap a picture of the man who robbed him of RM6,500 (S$2,661) worth of electronic equipment before fleeing on a motorcycle.
Yesterday, G. Prabudaasan, 20, was sentenced by a Sessions Court here to a three-year good behaviour bond for RM20,000 after he pleaded guilty to robbing engineer S. Vijayakumar, 42, at Jalan Persiaran Budiman in Section 25 here on July 22 last year.
Vijayakumar had sent an MMS of the snapshot via his handphone to the Sri Muda police station and gave a description of Prabudaasan's motorcycle, which has white star stickers.
Prabudaasan was arrested the next day.
