Real Madrid head coach Jos&eacute; Mourinho, famously known as "The Special One", told Indonesian media on Wednesday evening that he still had unfulfilled goals as a coach.
Mourinho - who is on a two-day visit to Jakarta on Wednesday and Thursday hosted by Hotel Borobudur, Central Jakarta - said he still wanted to win the Champions League title with three different clubs.
"Currently I've done it [winning Champions League titles] with two teams," he said, referring to Porto in 2003/2004 and Inter Milan in 2009/2010.
Mourinho also said that he wanted to win a title for his home country Portugal.
"However, I don't think I can achieve it with a national team who only play a match every two months or a competition every two years.
"I need to have the pressure to have two or three matches a week," he said.
Mourinho is regarded as one of the best ever soccer coaches, getting several different clubs, Benfica, Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, to the top of the leagues in their respective countries.
In 2008, Mourinho signed with Italian club Inter and helped the club win the Serie A, Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League titles, which was the first time for Inter in 45 years.
