It was hockey as it used to be played.
And on a venue that has rich history with a club that is renowned for hockey.
The Padang, especially the half that belongs to Singapore Recreation Club (SRC), used to be the playground of many former internationals, from the days of E. W. Barker, Percy Pennefather, Douglas Nonis, Farleigh Clarke to the stars of the '80s, to the new millennium.
Yesterday, more than 500 students played for honours on the grass patch in the tradition of yesteryear; stickwork over long scoops and no "spacesuit" for goalkeepers.
It was SRC's 4-a-side Schools' Hockey Carnival and the eight mini-pitches allowed for spectators to be in the midst of action.
And emotions were high; from the joy of scoring to the agony of injury.
The event aimed to promote the sport among the youth, and schools from the primary to the tertiary level engaged in healthy but competition bringing out the fun element that was almost tangible.
In the end, some won silverware and many walked away high-spirited and encouraged.
They were winners too.
