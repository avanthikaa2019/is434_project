SINGAPORE - A man suspected of loansharking activities was nabbed by police yesterday evening, thanks to two public-spirited residents.
A male resident, 27, spotted the 51-year-old suspect loitering suspiciously around the HDB blocks at Pasir Ris Street 41 at about 8pm.
He kept a watch on the suspect and engaged the help of a 19-year-old neighbour.
They saw the suspect scribbling some words on the wall of a staircase landing, but the suspect fled when he noticed he was being watched.
The residents followed the man to a nearby bus-stop and called the police.
Police arrived on the scene and arrested the suspect. A search was conducted around the vicinity and a red marker, believed to be used by the suspect, was seized.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect is believed to have scrawled loanshark-related graffiti on the wall of the staircase landing at the said block.
The suspect will be charged in Court tomorrow for loanshark harassment.
Under the Moneylenders Act (Revised Edition 2010), first time offenders found guilty of loanshark harassment shall be fined not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000 with mandatory imprisonment of up to five years and mandatory caning of up to six strokes.
