Ping Xiao (Dennis Chew), a late-night radio DJ, reads his former girlfriend's ghost stories on air, which leads him to uncover the reasons behind her death.
Chew never really gets the chance to show off his acting ability in this fairly typical horror film.
But its most chilling scene does belong to him. When Ping Xiao reads a story on air and the film focuses on his voice, it incites more chills than the rest of the movie.
GHOST ON AIR (PG13) Horror/73 minutes Rating: 2/5 stars
