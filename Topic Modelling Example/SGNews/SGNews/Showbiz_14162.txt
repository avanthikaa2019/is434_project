JOHOR BARU - She may be The Lady but she is still fair game for pirated DVD sellers, who have been offering illegal copies of the movie for the past two weeks.
Most of the pirated DVDs of the biopic starring Datuk Michelle Yeoh are sold for RM4.
The movie is set to be released in selected cinemas in the Klang Valley, Penang, Ipoh and Malacca next Thursday.
A DVD seller who only wanted to be known as Michael, said the DVDs had been available in his shop located in a popular shopping complex for over two weeks.
"Customers want to watch the movie as soon as possible because The Lady will only be available in selected cinemas.
"We are not complaining though, as we are getting more business. Even customers from Singapore keep asking for the DVD," he said at his shop here yesterday.
Michael claimed he could sell at least 10 copies a day as the quality of the pirated version was just as good.
A 29-year-old accountant, known just as Tan, admitted that she bought a copy of the DVD last week and had watched it twice with her family.
"I have always been fascinated by Aung San Suu Kyi . I couldn't wait for the movie to hit the cinemas so I bought the DVD," she said.
Sales executive A. Ng, 25, who is a fan of Yeoh, said he would buy a pirated DVD of the movie after finding out that The Lady would not be shown in Johor.
"It will be a waste of time and money to travel to other states just to watch a two-hour movie in the cinema," he added.
