President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered security forces to intensify and heighten security measures in Papua following the attack on a commercial aircraft by an armed gang at an airport in the country's easternmost province.
"The Coordinating Political, Legal, and Security Affairs Minister [Djoko Suyanto] has reported the incident to the President who was shocked by the report. The attack proved the situation in the region was still unsafe and thus requires a special approach by security authorities," Presidential spokesman Julian Aldrin Pasha told reporters at the Presidential Office on Monday.
A Twin Otter plane operated by privately run Trigana Air was attacked on Sunday morning shortly after it touched down at Mulia Airport in the Puncak Jaya regency, killing a journalist and injuring several other people onboard including the pilot and first officer.
The pilot lost control and the plane hit a warehouse.
"We are dealing with armed groups so the security measures must be 'special'," Julian said. "Attacks on commercial aircraft are a serious threat," he added.
