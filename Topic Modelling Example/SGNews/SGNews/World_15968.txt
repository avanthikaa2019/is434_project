BERLIN- A German woman was preparing Wednesday for an emotional reunion with her long-lost cat, missing and thought dead, but then handed in after 16 years apparently living in the woods, an animal home said.
"Poldi" the cat was found in a forest near the southern city of Munich and, emaciated, taken to the city's animal sanctuary.
Due to a tattoo behind his ear, "Poldi" was able to be quickly identified and his owner informed, Eveline Kosenbach from the animal home told AFP.
"She really didn't think she would see the cat again after such a long time," Kosenbach said, adding that finding a cat alive following such an extended period was "an extremely unusual occurrence."
The cat is "definitely" Poldi, she said, explaining that every animal is given a unique identification number.
The woman, who has not been identified, will come to pick up the cat on Thursday.
