WARSAW - Colombian superstar Shakira mixed business with pleasure recently recording songs for her next album during a stay in Poland to cheer on Spanish footballer boyfriend Gerard Pique at Euro 2012.
Shakira recorded the tracks from June 13 to 20 at the Radio Gdansk recording studio, Radio Gdansk President Lech Parell told AFP Friday.
&ldquo;There were days when she worked until dawn,&rdquo; he added, but declined to provide further details on her creative efforts.
The pop artist sang her way into the hearts of football fans with the hit &ldquo;Waka waka - This time for Africa", FIFA's official theme for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Parell said the Grammy award-winning singer's team first approached the Gdansk studio incognito at the end of May and it was only when a booking conflict arose that the studio learned of her identity.
&ldquo;At a certain point the information came up and so we stood on our heads and found some free time for Miss Shakira,&rdquo; Parell said.
&ldquo;Shakira is definitely a huge star, so yes we were certainly pleasantly surprised,&rdquo; he added, stressing that his studio was up to scratch for the likes of Shakira.
&ldquo;Just like our Euro 2012 stadia have appealed to the world, our studio built long before is also one that meets international standards,&rdquo; he said.
Parell was struck by how important it was for Shakira, who is 35, to keep her work hush-hush, as opposed to her openness to be caught in the spotlight while cheering for the 25-year-old Pique at the Gdansk stadium.
&ldquo;You could tell that here she wanted to completely remove herself from that climate and devote herself entirely to work,&rdquo; he said.
Having kicked off June 8 in Warsaw, the 16-nation Euro 2012 championships reach a climax with the final on July 1 in Ukraine's capital Kiev.
