A crew member of a harbour craft moored near Marina South Pier, SC 4245I, was reported missing to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) at about 8.30am today.
A search and rescue (SAR) operation coordinated by MPA, involving two MPA and one Police Coast Guard craft, has been launched. Divers have also been activated.
A report in The Straits Times said that the missing man is a 32-year-old Myanmar national, Mr Maung Zaw Myo Win.
Mr Zaw did not know how to swim, said his peers. He was last seen around 7am, starting the generator of another boat.
The MPA has issued navigational broadcasts to vessels in the vicinity to keep clear of the SAR area and to report any sighting of the missing person. Operations at Marina South Pier remain unaffected.
MPA is investigating the incident.
