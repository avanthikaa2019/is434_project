Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said goodbye to his younger brother, Freddy Lee Thiam Yew, at his family home at Coronation Road West on Friday.
Mr Freddy Lee died of cancer on Thursday evening. He was 85.
The former chairman of Vickers Ballas, one of Singapore's most prominent stockbroking firms, leaves behind his wife Eleanor Ngo Puay Chin and four children: Edmund, Tina, Jeffrey and Selena.
Mr Freddy Lee is the second youngest brother of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who has three brothers and one sister.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew told reporters at the wake: "There were five of us in the family, four boys and one girl, and now two boys have gone. I'm left behind with my youngest brother and my sister Monica. We were a close family and Fred was especially active. But that's life."
The funeral service will be held at St Andrew's Cathedral on Monday at 11am and he will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium.
Mr Freddy Lee had just celebrated his 85th birthday earlier this month.
Ms Tina Lee, 50, told The Straits Times that her father had prostate cancer six years ago but recovered from it. Last month, however, he was hospitalised twice in less than two weeks.
He fortunately managed to return home in time for his 85th birthday celebration on June 4. On Friday night, his doctor went to his home twice. He died at 3pm with his family by his bedside.
Mr Lee was a teacher for three years before he joined the police force in 1950. He stayed there for 18 years.
In 1970, he became a partner of stockbroking firm J. Ballas and Co, the predecessor of Vickers Ballas. He stepped down as chairman in 2000 before its merger with DBS Securities in 2001.
After retirement Mr Lee spent his days playing golf and breeding and training race horses. He once owned a horse farm in New Zealand.
Described as a doting grandfather, Mr Lee would set aside Fridays to spend time with his grandchildren, three of whom live in US while the rest are in Singapore.
