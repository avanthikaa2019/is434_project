TAIPEI - A Thai man was sentenced Friday to seven months in prison for forcefully kissing a Taiwanese woman and licking her face in a northern Taiwan city.
The man was convicted on obscenity charges as the act, which took place in New Taipei city in February, was carried out against the woman's wishes, said the Banciao district court.
According to the court, he grabbed the woman while she was jogging at night in a stadium. When they fell down as she resisted, he forcefully kissed and licked her until passers-by heard her screams and intervened.
He can appeal the ruling.
