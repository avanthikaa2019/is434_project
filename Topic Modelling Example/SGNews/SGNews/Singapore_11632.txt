Member of Parliament for Hougang Png Eng Huat held his first Meet-the-People session in Hougang Avenue 5 last night, after his victory at the by-election last Saturday.
The 50-year-old Workers' Party member said that he will keep an open mind about the issues residents raise.
He spoke to my paper yesterday afternoon at Serangoon Secondary School, where overseas votes were counted.
A total of 27 votes were cast in polling stations set up abroad - 13 voted for Mr Png and another 13 voted for the People's Action Party candidate Desmond Choo. One vote was rejected.
The new tally means Mr Png received 13,460 votes, or 62.08 per cent, while Mr Choo had 8,223 votes, or 37.92 per cent.
