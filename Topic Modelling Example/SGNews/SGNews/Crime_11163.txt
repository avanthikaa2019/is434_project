A man in his 30s raped his 22-year-old niece, filmed the act and threatened to release the video if she refused to marry him.
Harian Metro, quoting police sources, reported that the college student had accompanied her uncle to a night market in Kota Damansara.
"After they were done shopping at around 1am, the suspect took the victim to an oil palm estate in Kundang. He stopped the car and started molesting the victim while professing his love. He then asked for her hand in marriage," said the source.
Fearing for her safety, the victim agreed to marry the man and pleaded not to be harmed.
However, the victim's plea fell on deaf ears and the suspect proceeded to rape her.
He even filmed the act and threatened to show others the video if she refused to marry him.
The victim lodged a report at the Gombak district police headquarters immediately after the suspect sent her home in the morning.
