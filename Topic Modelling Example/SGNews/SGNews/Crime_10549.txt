MILAN - Italian police said on Wednesday they were arresting members of an anarchist organisation suspected of carrying out a string of recent attacks, including sending letter bombs to the tax collection agency Equitalia and Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
In a statement, Perugia-based police also said they had conducted more than 40 searches across Italy.
More details will be available at a press conference due at 0830 GMT(4:30pm local time).
A recent wave of attacks, which included the shooting and wounding of an Italian nuclear engineering company executive last month, have stoked fears of a return to 1970s-style political violence in crisis-hit Italy.
