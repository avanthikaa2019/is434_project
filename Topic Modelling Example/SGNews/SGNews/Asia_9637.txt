THAILAND - People in tall buildings in Phuket and Songkhla yesterday felt tremors from an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale centred in the north of Indonesia's Sumatra island, but no panicking was reported among Thai residents and tourists, who got on with life as usual.
The Thai Meteorological Department's Seismology Centre said in a statement that the quake struck at 11.34am. There was no danger of a tsunami because the quake was centred on land, it said.
Phuket Disaster Prevention and Mitigation official Sant Chantrawong said an initial survey found that the quake, which was felt briefly by those on the fourth and higher floors of buildings, didn't cause any property damage, deaths or injuries, and no alert was sounded by the National Disaster Warning Centre's warning towers.
