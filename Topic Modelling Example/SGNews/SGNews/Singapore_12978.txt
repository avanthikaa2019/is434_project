The taxi driver involved in a horrific accident with a Ferrari sports car has died, bringing the number of people killed in the incident to three.
Mr Cheng Teck Hock, 52, had reportedly suffered head injuries after his ComfortDelGro taxi was reportedly hit by the red sports car at the junction of Rochor Road and Victoria Street at around 4am last Saturday.
He was pronounced brain-dead at Tan Tock Seng Hospital that evening, and my paper understands that he died at around 7pm yesterday.
From video footage provided by an eyewitness to Shin Min Daily News, it is believed that the Ferrari was speeding and had beaten a red light.
Its driver, Mr Ma Chi, 31, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.
Mr Cheng had remained unconscious since he was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). His wife told Lianhe Wanbao that he was suffering from heavy bleeding in his lungs, liver and brain.
The couple have two sons and a daughter, who are between the ages of 16 and 21, the evening daily reported. Mr Cheng's wife said her husband had been driving the late shift for more than 10 years.
The taxi's passenger, a 41-year-old Japanese woman, was found unconscious following the crash and subsequently died at Singapore General Hospital. Her next-of-kin has been contacted.
The Ferrari's passenger was a woman from China in her 20s, who suffered serious injuries and a fractured right leg. She was also taken to TTSH.
Friends of Mr Ma whom The Sunday Times spoke to said they do not know who she is.
Reports said that Mr Ma, a financial investor, was from Sichuan, China. He had a wife, 29, and a daughter, three, and moved to Singapore four years ago. The couple are expecting their second child.
A motorcyclist, 25-year-old Muhammad Najib Ghazali, was also involved in the accident. Lianhe Wanbao reported that he was thrown off his bike and suffered spinal injuries.
