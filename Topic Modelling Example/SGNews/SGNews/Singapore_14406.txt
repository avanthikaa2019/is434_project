The search continues for a Myanmar man, 32, who is missing after he fell off a 12-seater harbour craft moored near Marina South Pier yesterday morning.
The man, Mr Zaw Myo Win, was last seen in the water shouting for help by another boat's crew member at around 8am. By the time he alerted Mr Zaw's fellow crew members, he was nowhere to be seen.
The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) was alerted at 8.30am that Mr Zaw, an employee of Everlast Marine Services, was missing from the boat.
MPA said it coordinated a search and rescue operation, involving two MPA and one Police Coast Guard craft. Divers from the National Diving Unit were also activated.
MPA has issued navigational broadcasts to nearby vessels to keep clear of the search and rescue area, and to report any sighting of the missing man.
Operations at Marina South Pier remain unaffected.
Mr Zaw worked on board the harbour craft, which ferries people to bigger ships and to Singapore's southern islands, such as St John's Island.
According to Mr Mark June Lazo, 28, who works on the same boat as Mr Zaw, the latter fell off the boat while he was bathing. His clothes, towel and mobile phone were found near the area where he was believed to be bathing.
Mr Lazo said Mr Zaw worked with Everlast Marine Services for four years and understands Mr Zaw planned to return to Myanmar this year.
Colleagues told The Straits Times that Mr Zaw could not swim.
He was last seen at about 7am yesterday by Mr Junrey Millan Hipe, the captain of another vessel belonging to Everlast Marine Services.
Mr Hipe said he heard someone shouting about a man falling overboard. He immediately began searching for Mr Zaw.
Last month, a man in his late 20s, Mr Mohammad Norhidayat, fell into the sea by accident. His body was found floating in the sea on March 24. The performer with Universal Studios Singapore was believed to have drowned off Sentosa's Tanjong Beach after a drinking session.
