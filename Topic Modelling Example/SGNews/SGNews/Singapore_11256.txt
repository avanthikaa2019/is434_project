THE Land Transport Authority (LTA) will begin work to install overhead traffic signals at the junction of Victoria Street and Rochor Road today.
The lights are expected to be operational from early next week.
In a statement yesterday, LTA said that it decided to bring forward the installation, instead of waiting until next year as planned, as "another precautionary measure".
An LTA spokesman said: "Many members of the public have sent in their feedback and suggestions on how to further improve this road junction and our traffic engineers have carefully looked at these feedback and suggestions."
The move comes in the wake of two dramatic traffic collisions last month - both captured on camera - at the junction, including one involving a Ferrari which claimed three lives.
LTA also said the overhead traffic lights will result in a narrowing of the pedestrian footpath there. That is, until full road-reinstatement works arising from the construction of Stage 1 of the Downtown Line are completed by the middle of next year.
"This is a trade-off we have to make to accommodate the additional precautionary measure," added the spokesman.
Last week, LTA synchronised the signals at the junction with those of the pedestrian crossing linking Bugis Junction and Bugis Village, so that they turn green at the same time. This was done as an "enhanced safety feature".
