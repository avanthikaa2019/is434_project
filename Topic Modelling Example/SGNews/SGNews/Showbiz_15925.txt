This convoluted film has the makings of a spoof, except that it takes itself quite seriously, which makes you wonder what director Patrick Yau learnt from his time as assistant director to Hong Kong film-maker Johnnie To.
Three friends (played by Singapore's Dai Yang Tian and Malaysia's Rynn Lim and Jack Lim) steal a luxury car.
This lands them into a whole lot of trouble with everyone, including a brutal murderer, Lim's ex-wife and a beautiful woman (Landy Wen) who seems death-proof.
