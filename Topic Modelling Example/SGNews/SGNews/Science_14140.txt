The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is launching a free mobile app today to encourage and drive industry and community ownership in managing workplace safety and health.
Snap@MOM allows members of the public or the workforce to take photographs of unsafe work practices and immediately send them to the occupiers of workplaces registered on the application.
You can also share photographs of good work practices.
To get the free app, search for "Snap@MOM" at the iTunes Apps Store or Google Play, then download and install it.
