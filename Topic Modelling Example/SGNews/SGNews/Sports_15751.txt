MIAMI - The Memphis Grizzlies snapped Miami's 17-game home win streak with a 97-82 victory on Friday behind a balanced attack which included a stellar 17-point performance from forward Rudy Gay.
Point guard Mike Conley and centre Marreese Speights scored 15 points each and power forward Zach Randolph came off the bench to finish with 14 points and 14 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who have won six of their past eight National Basketball Association games.
Miami finished one victory short of the franchise record of 18 straight wins at home which was set during the 2004-05 season.
It was their first defeat at the American Airlines Arena since they were beaten by Milwaukee on January 22.
"Everybody's fatigued," said Dwyane Wade. "That's the kind of season it is."
Forward LeBron James scored 11 of his 21 points in the third quarter for the Heat who also got 20 points from guard Wade and 19 from power forward Chris Bosh. James also had six assists and a half dozen rebounds.
The Heat beat Western Conference leading Oklahoma City 98-93 in their most recent game to extend the streak to 17.
The Grizzlies led from wire-to-wire Friday, building a 19-point lead in the first half. Memphis, which had seven players in double figure scoring, led by as many as 21 in the second half.
Miami had 16 turnovers compared to 12 for Memphis.
"When we turn the ball over, we're not that good, and we know that," said James.
Miami dropped three games back of Chicago in the battle for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.
