Samsung Electronics, Korea's biggest tech manufacturing firm, has released its all-new laptop computer line with high-performance multimedia applications, targeting young consumers.
The laptop, named "Series 5 Boost," in 15-inch and 17-inch display models, is embedded with the latest audio and video software and hardware, the company said on Sunday in a press release.
It has audio speaker systems provided by the US-based JBL, with subwoofers that can process low-pitched audio frequencies into high-quality sound.
Samsung's "Alive" audio software further enables consumers to enjoy 3D surround sound when using its new laptop computers.
With Intel's third-generation i7 and i5 chips, the Series 5 Boost can run programs faster allowing efficient "multi-tasking," it noted.
Also, the latest hybrid graphics processing units of the US-based Nvidia further boost the laptop's graphics functions 112 per cent higher than its previous model, with battery-saving capability.
The 15-inch laptop's one-terabyte capacity can store up to 125 movies, 75,000 pictures and 20,000 music files, without the use of external hard disk drives.
The Series 5 Boost's high-definition resolution and non-reflective screen offers cleaner pictures and visuals and is less tiring on consumers' eyes, the press release said.
