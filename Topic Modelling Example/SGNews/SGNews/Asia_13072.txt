CHINA - A teacher who was critically injured on Tuesday when she rushed into the path of an oncoming bus to save several students remained in the intensive care unit on Friday at Central Hospital in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang province.
Zhang Lili, 29, who teaches Chinese at No 19 Middle School of Jiamusi, lost both of her legs in the accident, which also injured several students.
The accident occurred around 8 pm on Tuesday. The bus was parked outside the school, and the driver was waiting for teachers and students to board when her leg hit the gear stick.
"We were waiting to board the bus when suddenly it began moving toward the teachers and students. Zhang Lili immediately pushed the students out of the way, but unfortunately she didn't escape. The bus crushed her legs. There were also some students injured," Wang Xiaoqian told the Heilongjiang Morning Post.
"Zhang Lili and four students were sent to our hospital at about 9 pm. Zhang was critically injured and her blood pressure was low. The situation was quite serious," said Liu Yanjun, the vice-director of Jiamusi Central Hospital.
"After consulting specialists, we decided that amputation was the only way to save her life," Liu said.
The deputy mayor of the city, Sun Zhe, has asked the hospital to "save the young teacher regardless of the cost" and "investigate the cause of the accident and address the issue to put an end to similar accidents".
Li Haibo, the director of the ICU, and Han Jianfeng, an orthopedic expert from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, arrived in Jiamusi on Thursday to help treat Zhang.
"If necessary, we will invite more specialists from the capital city, even from whole nation," said Liu.
Police have taken the driver of the bus into custody, and the accident remains under investigation.
