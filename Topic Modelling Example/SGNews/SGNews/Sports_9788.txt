Four years ago, she jumped for joy after winning the decisive point that guaranteed Singapore's first Olympic medal in 48 years.
Yesterday, paddler Feng Tianwei was all smiles as she was chosen as flag bearer for this year's London Olympics contingent.
She received the national flag during a ceremony at SingTel ComCentre from Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and London Games chef-de-mission Jessia Phua.
"It is a big honour," Feng said. "It will be a memorable moment for me to lead Singapore out at the London Games opening ceremony."
Currently, there are 18 Olympic-bound athletes for the July 27 to Aug 12 Games, and eight Paralympians who will take part in the Aug 29 to Sept 9 Paralympic Games.
Said Phua: "What I expect from every athlete is for them to come home with the belief that they can achieve more."
