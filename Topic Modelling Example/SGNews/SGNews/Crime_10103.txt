Police have arrested seven men and three women believed to be involved in a roadside attack on 24-year-old undergraduate Li Xue Song last Friday night.
Mr Li was driving along Victoria Street at close to midnight when a group of 15 motorcyclists started to drive very close to his Volkswagen Golf.
They knocked on the windows of his car and caused him to slam on his brakes before hitting his car from behind.
The driver came out of his car to check for damages but was unexpectedly attacked when he tried to call the police, The New Paper (TNP) reported today.
The motorcyclists punched and hit him with their helmets after a female biker started the assault by hitting him with her shoe, he told TNP.
They only started to flee when a passer-by stopped to help the bleeding driver.
Although he felt dizzy, Mr Li managed to stop one motorcyclist from leaving by taking his keys and grabbing onto him.
He told reporters that some of the riders stayed behind while the others fled.
The undergraduate also said that he was unsure what provoked the attack as he was neither speeding nor trying to intimidate the motorcyclists with the way he was driving.
According to the Straits Times, Mr Li's clothing and the motorbike he clung onto were all stained with blood.
He later received three stitches and was discharged from the hospital on Saturday morning.
