How do you get over heartbreak-induced self-starvation?
Why, sink your fangs into a new beefcake toy boy, of course.
Increasingly emaciated US actress Demi Moore, 49, was seen getting comfortable with 35-year-old US actor Joe Manganiello (inset) from the vampire TV series True Blood at the after-party for the premiere of the movie That's My Boy.
Moore split from her US actor-hubby Ashton Kutcher, 34, last November.
She and Manganiello "looked amazing together", a source told Heat magazine, adding: "Demi has finally got her groove back - and it's all thanks to meeting Joe. She's feeling confident again and, more importantly, sexy."
