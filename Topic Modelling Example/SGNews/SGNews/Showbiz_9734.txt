Kelantan's famous transvestite dikir barat singer Hafiz Jeffri appeared at the Syariah High Court dressed in men's attire and a kopiah.
Berita Harian reported that Hafiz, who is also known as Kajol, was hauled up by religious authorities and charged at the Syariah Court with dressing in women's clothing and having feminine mannerisms.
After Hafiz testified that he had repented, Syariah High Court judge Abu Bakar Abdullah Kutty set aside the one-month prison sentence that had been handed down earlier by the Syariah Lower Court.
The judge, however, maintained the RM1,000 (S$400) fine that had been imposed by the lower court.
Met outside the court, Hafiz said he would try to change his ways as well as reduce his dikir barat performances.
