A student was hauled to a district court yesterday after he allegedly used a fake $10,000 note to buy three iPhones.
Koh Siang Wei, 17, who was charged with one count of cheating, is accused of committing the offence with Lim Ming Cheng, Kenneth Chan and Jeremy Lim.
The four allegedly deceived Emerson Goh Shou En into believing the money was legal tender before buying the iPhones for $2,850.
They purportedly committed the offence at Kovan MRT station on May 22 last year, at around 10pm.
The plump, fair-complexioned Koh appeared in court in a white short-sleeved shirt with dark trousers.
The pre-trial conference will be held on May 7.
If convicted of cheating, he could be jailed up to 10years and fined.
