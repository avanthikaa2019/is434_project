Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are developing computers that can recognise facial expressions.
The technology enables computers to identify basic emotions such as like, dislike and confusion, by taking information about people's faces via camera and analysing how they move over time.
It can be applied in many ways, such as gathering information on people's responses to advertisements or helping people with autism read expressions better, said researchers.
