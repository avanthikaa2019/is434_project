US Supermodel Tyra Banks, 38, apparently believes in office romances.
The host and creator of reality TV modelling series America's Next Top Model is said to be dating 24-year-old British model Robert Evans, who is set to appear in the 19th season of her show as a regular judge.
The relationship reportedly began last month, and the pair were recently spotted canoodling over drinks in Los Angeles before retiring to Evans' hotel room.
They were spotted again a few days later enjoying a cozy champagne brunch in Newport Beach, where they reportedly stayed for a romantic two-day getaway.
