BEIRUT - Violence has killed more than 15,000 people in Syria since a revolt erupted last year against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday.
At least 10,480 civilians, 3,715 soldiers and 830 army defectors have been killed in the crackdown and in clashes since March 2011, said the Britain-based group, which counts those who have taken up arms against the regime as civilians.
"If the international community remains silent and happy to just observe the situation, more blood will flow in Syria," the Observatory's Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.
"The violence has only become worse in the past two months, and will become more bitter," he added.
An escalation of violence has pushed a team of nearly 300 UN observers in Syria to suspend their operations, although they remain in the strife-torn country.
