SEOUL - North Korea's new leader Kim Jong-Un on Saturday promoted 70 officers to the rank of general, state media said, following a shake-up of parliament, cabinet and a top decision-making body.
The move, aimed at cementing Jong-Un's grip on power, came after North Korea completed the transfer of state, military and party power from its late leader Kim Jong-Il to his son.
The North announced new parliament and cabinet appointments on Friday at a session of its rubber-stamp parliament, which also elected Jong-Un as "first" chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission (NDC).
Late leader Kim Jong-Il has been named "eternal" chairman of the commission, the country's top decision making-body.
Three people including Choe Rong-Hae, seen as one of Jong-Un's confidants, were made new NDC members, while two new vice-premiers and other state organisation heads were also named, according to the official news agency.
On Saturday Jong-Un issued an order to promote 70 field grade officers to general rank.
The promotions are seen as a move to push for a injection of new blood into the upper ranks of the North's armed forces, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.
North Korea is celebrating the April 15 centenary of the birth of Kim Il-Sung with major events including a long-range rocket launch which ended in failure on Friday.
The young leader has assumed almost all top posts previously held by his father since he took over last December and has been appointed as supreme commander of the country's 1.2-million army.
On Thursday he assumed the new title of "first secretary" of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, permanently leaving the top post of general secretary to his father.
