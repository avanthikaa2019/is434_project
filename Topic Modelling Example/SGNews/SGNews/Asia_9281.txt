OSAKA - The municipal government of Izumi-Sano, Osaka Prefecture, is considering introducing a tax on dog owners in a bid to reduce dog droppings on the city's streets, it has been learned.
Izumi-Sano plans to use revenue from the envisaged tax to set up patrols and educate owners about tidying up their pet's mess, the sources said.
Approval from the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry is required before the tax can be imposed.
About 5,400 dogs are registered in the city, which has received many complaints about faeces left on the street.
If no improvement is seen in about two years, the city will decide on whether to impose the new tax.
