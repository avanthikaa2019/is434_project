Against the backdrop of Japanese military aggression in China in the 1930s, Xiao Dongbei (Lei Jiayin) survives by his quick wit. He unwittingly gets roped into a scheme by an underground resistance group to pull off a robbery of Japanese gold bullion.
The tone of Guns N' Roses lurches from comedy to romance to suspense and serious drama, with Ning Hao, writer-director of the hit comedy Crazy Stone (2006), unable to juggle them smoothly to convincingly tell the story of one man's political awakening.
