SEATTLE - Starbucks Corp said on its blog last Thursday that it will stop using a natural, government-approved colouring made from crushed beetles in its strawberry flavouring by late June, bowing to pressure from some vegetarian customers.
Starbucks has been using the extract in its strawberry frappuccinos and smoothies, as well as some deserts like raspberry swirl cake.
"After a thorough, yet fastidious, evaluation, I am pleased to report that we are reformulating the affected products to assure the highest quality possible," Mr Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks US, wrote in a blog post.
Instead, the coffeehouse chain said it plans to use lycopene, a natural, tomato-based extract. Mr Burrows said Starbucks "fell short" of customer expectations. One blogger last month began an online petition to pressure Starbucks to stop the practice.
Ground-up cochineal beetles are a commonly used Food and Drug Administration-approved food colouring.
