Just as US singer-actress Miley Cyrus is engaged to marry her actor- boyfriend, Liam Hemsworth, her older brother has fallen out of love.
US rocker Trace Cyrus, 23, announced that he and his fiancee, 24-year-old US actress Brenda Song have parted ways. They had got engaged last October.
Cyrus told Us Weekly: "Brenda and I have... split up a couple of months ago... I wish Brenda the best and much success in the future."
A source added: "They just weren't ready for what they got themselves into... It just (came) down to them being too young and not ready (for marriage)."
