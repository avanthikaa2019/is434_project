One in three Singaporeans is a member of co-operatives here, according to figures from the Singapore National Co-operative Federa- tion (SNCF).
There are about 1.4 million co-operative members in Singapore, and the number of co-operatives has hovered around 80 in the past five years.
Out of these members, at least 500,000 are members of National Trades Union Congress' FairPrice, while more than 10,000 are members of credit co-operatives.
These figures were released yesterday at an SNCF press conference to announce the launch of Singapore's first legal-tender stamps based on milestones of significant co-operatives in Singapore.
The stamps, which come in a set of five, will be available at all SingPost outlets from today.
The launch is in celebration of this year's United Nations International Year of Co-operatives (UN IYC).
At the event, Mr Chan Tee Seng, the chairman of SNCF, said: "The IYC is an opportunity to bring more people together and raise public awareness for our cause.
"When we look at new social challenges today...it's not just the Government that plays a role, but also the civil society."
The co-operative movement is a form of that mechanism, where people can come together and tackle issues on their own, he said.
Today, SNCF has an active campus sector comprising of co-operatives in tertiary institutions.
Efforts have also been made to educate youth about co-operative values. For example, students enrolled in Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Business and Social Enterprise course learn about co-operatives in one of their course modules.
