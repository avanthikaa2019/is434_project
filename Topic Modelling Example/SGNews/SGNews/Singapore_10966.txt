Former school principal Lee Lip Hong was released from prison today at 11.45am, according to local media reports.
He was released after six weeks for good behaviour, the report said.
Lee had engaged the services of an underage prostitute twice in an online vice ring. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine weeks' jail.
He was the first of the 48 men to plead guilty. They were charged with paying for sex with the same underage prostitute.
The report added that he was picked up by a friend in a car. Both his wife and daughter did not turn up.
It added that Mr Lee, a free thinker, had turned to Christianity and inspirational books while in prison.
