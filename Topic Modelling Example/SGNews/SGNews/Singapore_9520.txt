SINGAPORE - China Press reported that a man was now heavily in debt after he borrowed $1,000 from a loan shark in Singapore.
Within four months, the amount had ballooned to S$180,000, rendering him unable to pay the debt. He now owes at least 87 loan sharks in the island republic.
It all started when the man, in his 40s, began working as a middleman to provide labour services two years ago. He started borrowing from a loan shark in February after running out of cash entertaining his clients.
His nightmare began when he could not afford to pay the initial debt. He then had to turn to another loan shark and before long, the number of loan sharks increased.
