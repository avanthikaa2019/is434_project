PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - A cleaning lady was shocked when she found a human skull while she was rummaging through a trash bin for recyclable items at the Tiara Kelana condominium here.
The woman had first noticed a large garbage plastic bag near the heap of trash in the 11.30am incident yesterday.
Looking for recyclable items, she opened the bag and found what appeared to be some white objects that she initially thought were odd-looking stones.
Then, she came face-to-face with the skull.
She quickly alerted the apartment management staff, who called the police.
Petaling Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Arjunaidi Mohamed said the skeleton in the bag looked like a learning aid prop usually used in medical schools but it was not complete.
"The bones are strung together with thread and a few pieces are missing," he said.
ACP Arjunaidi said the case did not have any signs of foul play but the police would investigate.
