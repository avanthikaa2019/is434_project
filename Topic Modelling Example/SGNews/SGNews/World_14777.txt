OSLO - Anders Behring Breivik told an Oslo court Thursday he meant &ldquo;to kill everybody&rdquo; in his Utoeya massacre, not just 69 people, and that he also wanted to behead a former prime minister.
&ldquo;The goal was to kill everybody,&rdquo; the 33-year-old right-wing extremist told the court, adding he had first planned to capture former prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and behead her on camera, before posting the video online.
&ldquo;I stand for Utoeya and what I did, and would still do it again,&rdquo; he said, as survivors and victims' family members cried quietly and shook their heads in disgust.
Breivik is on trial for &ldquo;acts of terror&rdquo; for his July 22 twin attacks, when he killed eight people with a van-bomb targeting buildings housing the offices of Labour Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who was not present at the time.
He then travelled to Utoeya island where, dressed as a police officer, for more than one hour he methodically shot at hundreds of people at a Labour Party youth summer camp, taking 69 lives, mostly teenagers.
There were 569 people on the island the day of the attacks, according to police.
But Breivik insisted he was &ldquo;not a child murderer", stressing he had thought there was a 16-year age limit to attend the camp and that he thought it was not &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; to kill anyone under the age of 18.
He also stressed that &ldquo;there were no better political targets in Norway that day,&rdquo; and reiterated that most of the people he had killed had &ldquo;leading positions&rdquo; within the youth group, which to him made them &ldquo;category B&rdquo; traitors.
When asked what it was like to go on such a shooting rampage, Breivik acknowledged it was &ldquo;extremely difficult to do ... It goes against human nature in many ways.&rdquo;
But, he insisted, Norwegian and European authorities were forcing him and other &ldquo;militant nationalists&rdquo; to carry out &ldquo;fire-arm based operations&rdquo; because they made it so difficult to get hold of explosives.
&ldquo;We are forced to this because ... authorities have taken away our chances of using explosives,&rdquo; he said, adding he would have preferred setting off another bomb.
&ldquo;It is easy to push a button .. Much, much harder to do something so barbaric as a shooting operation,&rdquo; he told the court.
