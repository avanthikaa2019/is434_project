Employers who have not raised their workers' minimum daily wage to Bt300 after the Sunday deadline will be facing legal action, the Department of Labour Protection and Welfare said yesterday.
Meanwhile, employers who have been including other benefits under the guise of increasing the basic wage have one month to stop doing so, otherwise they will face prosecution, which includes six months in jail and/or a fine of up to Bt100,000 (S$4,060), director-general Arthit Issamo said.
Arthit was responding to calls from labour leader Chalee Loysoong, who said a large number of workers had complained about not being given a raise after the Sunday deadline, which covered businesses in seven provinces including Bangkok.
In response to a statement from Bhumindr Harinsuit, deputy chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, who expressed concern that security guards, maids, hotel staff and contractors might lose their jobs because their employers could not shoulder higher costs, Arthit said these positions were far too important to be terminated.
"I don't believe they will be sacked because then who will guard and clean the business premises," he said, though he did not say anything about hotel staff and contractors.
