SINGAPORE - Mr Derek Low - the University of California, Berkeley, student who made waves with his automated dorm room - will soon be meeting people from Google and LinkedIn.
Over 20 technology firms have sought to meet the 21-year-old and 10 are offering him summer internships.
The Singaporean student shot to fame after a video of his self-made automated room went viral online.
The video on YouTube had over 1.3 million views in two weeks. He was also featured on CNN, Time magazine and tech blog Gizmodo.
But Mr Low's fame eventually invited the wrath of the Berkeley housing authorities.
His dorm was considered a safety hazard, and he received a warning letter last Friday after a judicial hearing.
However, the letter - labelled "confidential" - had no real implications, Mr Low told my paper.
He described it as "boring" and did not remove any of the modifications done to his room.
On the letter, he added: "I got off. Nothing happened, I'm fine. I'm good now. I don't care. I move on."
But Mr Low's modifications will be dismantled tomorrow, when he moves out following the end of the semester. He said that moving out has nothing to do with the letter he received.
When school resumes in September, he will be moving into a private residence, like most second-year students.
On whether he will modify his new room, he said: "It's not my main project for next semester. I want to try something new."
