KAGOSHIMA - Five people were slightly injured Sunday morning after a high-speed boat they were on crashed into what appeared to be a whale off Kagoshima Prefecture, according to a local coast guard office.
Two passengers and three crew members suffered blows to their shoulders or hips when the 140-ton vessel collided with what appeared to be a whale shortly before 9 a.m. on its way from Kagoshima to Yakushima island, Kagoshima Prefecture, the Kagoshima Coast Guard Office said.
The ship left the prefectural capital at 7:45 a.m., carrying about 190 people. It was traveling at about 80 kph at the time of the accident, two kilometers west of Sata Cape.
The boat became unable to move under its own power but was never in danger of sinking, according to the coast guard and the boat's operator.
