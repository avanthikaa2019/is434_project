Singaporean employees are highly motivated when their bosses share facts, data and knowledge, more so than their counterparts in other parts of the Asia-Pacific, a survey has found.
AchieveGlobal, a learning-based solutions provider, found that 97.4 per cent of the people polled here said so, as opposed to the 88.4 per cent average for Asia-Pacific workers.
The survey polled over 1,000 employees in 10 Asia-Pacific markets - such as Australia, India and China - from October to December last year. Nearly 180 people were polled here.
Singaporean employees are also more likely to be motivated when allowed to participate in decision-making, compared to other workers in the Asia-Pacific.
All the people polled here said they are "very" motivated when allowed to do so, compared to 94.8 per cent on average for Asia-Pacific employees.
When bosses avoid expressions like "should", "ought" and "have to", 63.1 per cent of Singaporeans are "very" motivated by this, compared to 70 per cent for Asia-Pacific workers on average.
The survey also showed that Singapore workers are among the region's most motivated employees, with 59 per cent of respondents being "quite" or "very" motivated, compared with 55 per cent on average for Asia-Pacific employees.
