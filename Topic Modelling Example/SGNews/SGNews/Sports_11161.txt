BEIJING - Disappointed Chinese tennis fans flooded the country's top microblog site Sina Weibo with 11 million messages yesterday, as they grappled with defending champion Li Na's shock French Open defeat.
Reactions ranged from sympathy to contempt, after the combustible Li succumbed to a 6-3, 2-6, 0-6 loss against little-known Kazakhstan qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova, ranked 142, in the fourth round.
"What's wrong with Li Na? It must be because she did not thank her mother country last time," posted one user.
Another blamed Li's "mood swings" for her defeat, saying they were the 30-year-old world No. 7's "major weakness", after she imploded in the second set and never recovered.
Many bloggers, however, were more forgiving of the fallen champion.
"Who can be champion forever?" asked one, while another advised her to "take a rest and keep fighting".
