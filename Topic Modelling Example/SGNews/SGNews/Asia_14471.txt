JAKARTA - Police are still hunting down a group of people who threw Molotov cocktails at the Jakarta office of the People's Health Council (DKR), an NGO led by former health minister Siti Fadilah Supari (above), early Saturday.
Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said investigators were examining witnesses' testimonies to identify the perpetrators, tempo.co reported.
"We are still searching for the motivation behind the attack. They did not give any message prior to the assault," he said on Sunday.
He said investigators had yet to sketch the perpetrators' appearances because CCTV footage at the crime scene in Johar Baru, Central Jakarta, had not been recovered.
Police believe a group of men riding motorcycles threw Molotov cocktails at the DKR office at around 1:30 a.m. on Saturday.
A sofa on the office's terrace was burned, but no injuries were reported.
Siti Fadillah has been named a suspect in a graft case centering on the procurement of medical supplies at the Health Ministry in 2005.
