KUALA LUMPUR - A suspected robber has been found dead after a botched holdup where he was shot by the potential victim.
A security guard at a parking lot near the Titiwangsa lake discovered the body slumped in the front passenger seat of a Proton Waja at about 6pm yesterday.
"The man appeared to have a gunshot wound to his ribs and I quickly called the police," said the security guard when met at the scene.
It is believed that the deceased was part of a gang which tried to rob a man near a bank in Kelana Jaya at about 1pm.
They had waited until the man left the bank and tried to ambush him.
Unfortunately for the robbers, the would-be victim was armed with a pistol and he opened fire.
One of them could have been wounded in the shooting.
The robbers quickly retreated and fled in a Waja, believed to be the same one in which the deceased was found five hours later.
City CID chief Senior Asst Comm Datuk Ku Chin Wah confirmed that both cases were linked and said police were tracking the other gang members.
