PARIS - France's new government, under socialist President Francois Hollande, got down to business yesterday, with the first order of business on their agenda being a pay cut for themselves.
Mr Hollande unveiled a government of mainly moderate socialists and long-time allies on Wednesday as his new prime minister vowed to work quickly to put the country back on its feet.
The new line-up also meets a promise to appoint an equal number of men and women in his Cabinet, a first for France, although most of the senior posts went to men.
New Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Mr Hollande's government would waste no time and hold its first meeting on Thursday, despite it being a public holiday, and would address the economic crisis.
"What's essential, and that's why the Cabinet will meet as soon as Thursday, is to get quickly to work to allow France to get back on its feet in a just way," Mr Ayrault told journalists.
Like Mr Hollande, who on Tuesday became France's first socialist president since 1995, Mr Ayrault has never previously held a ministerial post, the first time that both posts have been held by government rookies.
Mr Hollande tapped former prime minister Laurent Fabius, 65, as foreign minister and his campaign chief during the race against Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, and 54-year-old Pierre Moscovici as finance minister.
Notably absent from the line-up was socialist leader and former labour minister Martine Aubry, a key figure in the party's old-guard left wing, who said she would not join Cabinet after being passed up for the premiership.
Mr Ayrault said the first order of business would be the imposition of a 30 per cent pay cut for the President and all ministers, as Mr Hollande promised in the campaign.
"This is about setting an example," he told France 2 television.
"I will also propose a code of conduct," he said. "Everyone must sign this commitment on conflicts of interest, holding more than one office and not carrying out any other activities."
