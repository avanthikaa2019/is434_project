In a series of raids since Tuesday, forestry officials have seized 25 resorts in Nakhon Ratchasima's Thap Lan national park, including a newly renovated one on a 7.5rai plot yesterday.
The raids are part of a crackdown by the Royal Forest Department, which is targeting another 118 resorts in the park in addition to those previously designated as illegal.
Phongthep Malasing, who leads a local tourism group, said villagers and resort owners were not protesting against the raids as strongly as they were late last year, because they have a better understanding of the crackdown. He said the price of rooms had been cut by up to 60 per cent, not because of the crackdown but because it was lowtourist season.
