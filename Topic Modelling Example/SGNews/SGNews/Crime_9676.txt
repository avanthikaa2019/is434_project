The serial thief allegedly zeroed in on units that were being renovated and stole home entertainment systems.
On Wednesday afternoon, police arrested a 32-year-old man believed to have been involved in at least six break-ins in the Marsiling and Woodlands areas between May 3 and May 19.
Victims had found the combination locks on their gates removed and the equipment stolen. Combination locks are usually used for convenience during renovations so that workers have easy access to the home.
The suspect was arrested at Paya Lebar.
Police officers found an LCD TV, a DVD player, audio speakers and other electrical appliances at the suspect's home.
The items are believed to have been stolen.
He is scheduled to be charged in court today with housebreaking and theft by day. If convicted, he can be jailed up to 10 years and can also be fined.
The police remind members of the public to lock their units properly to prevent such incidents from happening.
