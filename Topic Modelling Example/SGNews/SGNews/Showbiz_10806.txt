Mediacorp has been fined for comments about the mentally ill made by Class 95FM DJ Glenn Ong.
The Media Development Authority imposed a fine of $4,500, Channel NewsAsia reported.
The New Paper reported on Sept 20 last year that Ong had said on air: "If you have to put these mad dogs to sleep, then you should."
MediaCorp said at the time: "He did not mean to link these individuals to 'crazy dogs'. What he meant to say was that if a dog had attacked someone, measures would be taken, so in the same vein, mentally unstable people should be monitored to protect other members of the public from danger."
