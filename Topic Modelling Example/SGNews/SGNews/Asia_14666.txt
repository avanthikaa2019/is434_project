Two female employees were killed Friday by brown bears that escaped from a cage at the Hachimantai Bear Farm in Kazuno, Akita Prefecture, police said.
When three employees--including the two women--opened the cage to feed the bears, the bears escaped and attacked them, police said. A male employee in his 60s was unharmed. The dead women, aged 75 and 69, were bitten on their legs and other parts of their bodies.
Local hunters killed six bears Friday afternoon. The farm, which was closed for the winter holidays and due to open later this month, had about 50 bears.
