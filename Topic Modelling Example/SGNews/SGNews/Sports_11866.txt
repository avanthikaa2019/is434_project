The South Korean women's volleyball team is headed for the 2012 London Olympics, the first time since 2000, after a strong win over Thailand at the qualifying tournament in Japan on Saturday.
Korea is now 4-2, placing it in second at the Federation Internationale de Volleyball Women's World Olympic Qualification Tournament before Sunday's game against Peru.
The Korean team secured its ticket to London after Thailand took down Cuba with a four-set victory at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium on Sunday.
Going into Sunday, Korea had needed a win against Peru to guarantee its Olympic bid but Thailand's win over Cuba finalized things for Korea.
Thailand's game put Korea in second place after Russia. Japan is in third.
Korea's place on the podium is likely to surprise analysts once again after Korea, internationally ranked 13th, bested Japan, ranked third, 3-1 last Wednesday.
This will be the first Olympics for the Korean women's volleyball team since the 2000 Sydney Olympics. That year, Korea came in eighth after being knocked out by the U.S. in the quarterfinals.
