SHAH ALAM, Malaysia - Police have arrested a second man in connection with the case of a 51-year-old special education teacher who was abducted and robbed on June 6.
Selangor CID chief Senior Asst Comm Mohd Adnan Abdullah said a 22-year-old man was arrested at a hotel in Puchong on Friday.
"His looks matches up to almost 90% with one of the suspects caught on CCTV," he told reporters after a Selangor Police Family Association (Perkep) cycling event here yesterday.
SAC Adnan said the man had several prior criminal records, including one in which he broke into a Datin's car.
He said the suspect was still keeping mum and had refused to cooperate but police were confident that he was one of the men behind Teoh Soo Kim's abduction and robbery.
Police are still looking for three more men to help in investigations.
SAC Adnan said the first suspect, aged 48, who was arrested in Ipoh last Saturday, had been released on bail.
Meanwhile, Teoh has started to show signs of recovery, said her son Edward.
She had been under medically-induced coma at the Sungai Buloh Hospital since the attack.
"We are still praying for her to recover fully and are with her everyday," he said in a Facebook posting yesterday.
Teoh was brutally beaten and dumped at the Talang oil palm estate in Kuala Selangor.
She went missing after leaving her house in Bandar Kinrara 2 at 7am to pick up one of her students for class.
She was found unconscious by passers-by at 11am the same day.
Those with information on the case are urged to contact 03-8074 2222 or the nearest police station.
