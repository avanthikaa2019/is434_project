The consortium building Singapore's ultra fast broadband network, OpenNet, has commenced legal action against the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and another party.
The Straits Times reported today that OpenNet is seeking a 'quashing order' from the Supreme Court in its originating summons.
A quashing order is usually sought when a party wants to void a directive given by an authority.
The AGC, the Government's principal legal adviser, confirmed with the English daily that it has ceased to be involved in the case.
However, it is not known who the other party is as court documents have not been updated since private hearings in February.
It is also not known what OpenNet is trying to nullify as court documents are sealed.
OpenNet did not comment when contacted about the pending court case.
The company is represented by Senior Counsel Tan Chee Meng of Wong Partnership, while the defendant is represented by Senior Counsel Cavinder Bull of Drew &amp; Napier, court listings showed.
OpenNet has been under pressure lately for delays in connecting subscribers to the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network.
Subscribers have waited for up to six weeks before getting connected.
According to The Straits Times, OpenNet also did not suggest a new quota after regulator Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) directed it to step up weekly installations from the current quota of 2,400.
IDA also brought forward its review of OpenNet's service contract by 18 months.
