KUALA LUMPUR - A Singaporean's holiday here turned expensive after he was fined RM4,500 by a magistrate's court for entering a women's toilet and peeping at a woman.
Ong Lek Lim, 51, pleaded guilty to insulting the modesty of the travel consultant by peeking into her toilet cubicle.
He also admitted to the charge of criminal trespass by entering the toilet on the 11th floor of the Amoda building in Jalan Bukit Bintang at 3pm on June 13.
It was learnt that the victim, upon noticing Ong spying on her, chased him out of the toilet and with the help of her employer, apprehended him.
In mitigation, Ong pleaded for a lenient sentence, saying he had apologised for his actions.
