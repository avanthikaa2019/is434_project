MANCHESTER, England - Manchester United on Tuesday completed the signing of England Under-18 international Nick Powell from Crewe.
The 18-year-old, who had also been targetted by Premier League side Everton, has passed a medical and will join the club at the beginning of July on a four-year deal.
"We have scouted Nick for months now," said manager Sir Alex Ferguson.
"He is an exceptional talent and has been schooled well at Crewe. I'm delighted he has chosen to come to United.
"He has a lot to offer and we are all looking forward to working with him."
Powell made his senior debut at aged 16. His last appearance for Crewe came in the League Two play-off final at Wembley in May when he scored in the win over Cheltenham.
An attacking midfielder, he is expected to fill the void created by Paul Pogba's imminent exit for Juventus.
"It really is a dream come true to be signing for Manchester United," said Powell.
"I have had a great time at Crewe and would like to thank them for helping me to develop as a player over the past 13 years.
"I'm excited about continuing my development with Sir Alex and the world class players in the squad.
"The thought of making the step up to the Premier League next year is an exciting prospect. I can't wait to get started."
