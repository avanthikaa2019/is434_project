Singapore and India have just conducted the annual Singapore-Indian Maritime Bilateral Exercise (SIMBEX).
Hosted this year by India, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the Indian Navy (IN) took part in this year's exercise, held from March 21 to April 1, in the series of bilateral exercises held since 1994. The sea phase of this year's SIMBEX is held at the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal.
This year, it involved naval and air assets with the RSN deploying a frigate and a missile corvette, and the IN participating with a destroyer, a corvette, a replenishment tanker, two fast attack crafts, a frigate and a submarine. As for air assets, both the RSN and IN deployed maritime patrol aircraft and naval helicopters.
Over the years, the SIMBEX has grown in scale and complexity. It has evolved from training-oriented anti-submarine warfare exercises to advanced naval warfare exercises involving air, surface and sub-surface dimensions.
