Succeeding in the food and beverage industry isn't as easy as it seems. Just ask these celebrities.
Dennis Chew Best known for his alter ego Aunty Lucy, actor-DJ Dennis Chew's travel-themed restaurant Figos Grail pulled down its shutters in February after just eight months of operation.
Despite the initial hype when it opened in July last year, the business failed to take off and was in the red every month, Chew said in an interview with Shin Min Daily News last week.
He and his partners are now sourcing for a new location and plan to venture into the food industry again.
Terence Cao The actor opened Restoran Selayang in March 2009 with fellow actor Zhang Yaodong and MediaCorp stunt coordinator Kong Xiang De.
The roasted meat business folded in 2010, but Cao is now embroiled in a monetary dispute with the meat supplier who claims to be owed payment.
Cao's other foray into the food business - HeyHey Hotpot in PoMo shopping mall at Selegie Road - continues to thrive.
Nazri Nasir The former captain of the national football team opened a Mediterranean cafe in June 2003.
Cafe de Leila, named fondly after his wife, was located in the former Le Meridien Shopping Centre.
It served a mix of Mediterranean, Western and local food.
The cafe closed in 2004 due to bad business.
