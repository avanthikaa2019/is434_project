CHICAGO - A young US woman who allegedly bit her bulldog during a drunken argument with her mother was charged with animal cruelty and domestic battery, police said Monday.
Neighbors called police after hearing loud screaming and pounding coming from the family home in Lake in the Hills, Illinois.
Police said 19-year-old Analise Garner hit and scratched her mother's face and bit her on the right hand during the altercation.
The family's 80-pound English bulldog had three bite marks on its back that were visible through its white fur.
"The bulldog finally did bite her back in self-defense," said Sergeant Mike Smith. "There were no charges against the dog," he quipped.
Garner, who was taken to hospital for treatment of the dog's defensive bite, was also charged with underage drinking. She was released on US$3,000 (S$3,767) bond.
