PARIS - France's new first lady took a very public swipe at her husband's former partner, Segolene Royal, with a good luck tweet sent Tuesday to the politician standing against her in parliamentary polls.
Valerie Trierweiler's message on Twitter also put her at odds with her husband Francois Hollande, who has declared his full support for Socialist Royal's electoral bid.
Hollande was Royal's unmarried partner for decades, is the father of her four children, and stood at her side during her 2007 failed presidential bid even though he had been in a relationship with Trierweiler since 2005.
Reports of rivalry between the two women led to speculation, which Trierweiler denies, that the current first lady made sure Royal was airbrushed out of a film screened to Socialist faithful at Hollande's January campaign launch.
Trierweiler, a twice-divorced 47-year-old journalist, tweeted Tuesday that she wished "good luck" to Olivier Falorni, a Socialist dissident competing with Royal for a parliamentary seat for the western town of La Rochelle.
Hollande, who is not married to Trierweiler, has publicly thrown his weight behind Royal, writing that she is "the only candidate of the presidential majority who can be assured of my support".
The second round of parliamentary elections is due on Sunday.
