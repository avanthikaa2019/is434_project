Fans of the Jambox - the small Bluetooth speaker made for the iPhone that sold so well - would be happy to know that there is now an equivalent made for the iPad.
It is a little larger to match the iPad, with which it is paired via Bluetooth or a tethered cable.
Upon opening the box of the O!music Powow, the impression one gets is that the device is a very well-packaged product.
Make quality of the device, which comes with a wood veneer finish, is excellent.
Bluetooth pairing with the iPad is a cinch, although the speaker's sound via the tethered cable seems better.
The speaker is rated at eight hours of playing time although, when tested, it was less.
However, sound quality is very acceptable. It is certainly a good accessory to have for playing music and videos on the iPad.
How much: $199
