DAMASCUS - United Nations-Arab envoy Kofi Annan arrived in the Syrian capital yesterday in a bid to salvage his battered peace plan, expressing "shock" at the massacre of more than 100 people in the town of Houla.
Mr Annan said the "tragic" massacre in the central Syrian town was "an appalling moment with profound consequences".
He was speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem.
The former UN secretary-general said those responsible for the massacre must be held accountable, and called on "everyone with a gun" to abide by his six-point blueprint to help end 15 months of bloodshed.
World leaders have voiced outrage over the deaths of at least 108 people in Houla last Friday and Saturday, among them 49 children and 34 women, many gruesomely blown to bits or shot dead at point-blank range.
The UN Security Council - where Syrian allies Russia and China wield veto powers - on Sunday condemned the Damascus government's use of heavy artillery in the assault on Houla.
"I am personally shocked and horrified by the tragic incident in Houla two days ago, which took so many innocent lives, children, women and men," Mr Annan told reporters at a Damascus hotel.
"I intend to have serious and frank discussions with President Bashar al-Assad. I also look forward to speaking with a range of other people while I am here."
Mr Annan's peace plan was supposed to begin with a ceasefire from April 12 but it has been broken daily.
Beijing condemned the massacre and called for an "immediate investigation into this issue and to find the perpetrators".
The comments from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin stopped short of directly condemning the Assad government.
Russia insisted that it was not a supporter of the Syrian government but also told world powers to concentrate on ending spiralling violence rather than regime change.
