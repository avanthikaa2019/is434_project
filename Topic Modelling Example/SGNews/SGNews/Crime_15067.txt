China Press reported that a husband fell from the 20th floor in front of his two brothers in Hong Kong after he failed to convince his 26-year-old wife to come back to him.
According to Hong Kong media, the 31-year-old man is believed to have killed his wife at a motel before taking his own life on April 13.
The man was said to have brought their six-year-old son to meet his wife at a karaoke session in his bid to win her back on April 12.
However, after she rejected the idea of reconciliation, the man asked her to meet him again at the motel after sending his son back.
Sources said the two are believed to have had sex before the wife was killed as a used condom was found at the scene.
The wife, who was asking for divorce, was said to have been seeing a 25-year-old colleague for some time, it reported.
