BRUSSELS - French President Francois Hollande stepped up his push Thursday for the launch of eurobonds after a summit of EU leaders in Brussels exposed divisions on the issue.
Hollande said he wanted to see eurobonds "written into the agenda" of the European Union going forward, saying he saw jointly pooled eurozone debt as a fundamental means through which to bolster the debt-stricken single euro currency.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly come out against eurobonds and Hollande told a news conference after five hours of talks among EU leaders in Brussels he had a "different conception" of what eurobonds offer Europe, and that he did not see their introduction "only as a destination".
He said: "There is perhaps a means by which to mutualise... future debt to enable countries... to access financing more easily on (money) markets."
Suggesting this would allow governments to "finance investments", the new Socialist president said that pooling liabilities for past debts was "unacceptable" but that eurobonds could help countries paying high borrowing costs, such as Spain and Italy.
EU president Herman Van Rompuy said the subject was "briefly touched upon" by several leaders "in the framework of deepening the monetary and economic union".
However, he stressed: "There was nobody asking for the immediate introduction of this."
He underlined, as leaders begin preparing ideas for a growth pact ahead of a full summit on June 28-29: "We have to consider what the legal implications of all this are."
