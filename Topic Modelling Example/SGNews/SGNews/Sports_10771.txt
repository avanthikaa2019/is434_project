The retractable roof of Warsaw's national stadium will be open for the remaining games of Euro 2012, Uefa said last Saturday, saying a much-criticised decision to close it for the opening game was due to a thunderstorm.
The Polish media and officials have complained that the stadium's humid atmosphere contributed to a poor second-half performance by the co-hosts, who dominated Greece in the first half with an energetic game.
