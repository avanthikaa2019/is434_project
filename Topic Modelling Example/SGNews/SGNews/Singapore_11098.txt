This python was spotted on a tree near Block 69, Redhill Close, at about 6.30pm On Monday.
It was later captured by an Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) team at 8pm.
TNP reader Ronnie Lim, 63, a manager, was surprised to see the snake, which he estimated to be about 4m long, near his home.
