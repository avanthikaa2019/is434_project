PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Venus will cross the Sun's face as seen from Earth for the last time this century on June 6.
National Space Agency (Angkasa) research officer Lau Chen Chen said Malaysians would be able to view Venus moving across the face of the Sun from 6.09am until 12:50pm.
"The transit of Venus across the Sun takes place when Venus passes directly between the Sun and Earth and becomes visible against the solar disk.
"During the transit, Venus can be seen as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun," she said yesterday.
Venus transit happens when the Sun, Venus and Earth are in the same line on the intersection points between Venus' orbit and the Earth's orbit.
It recurs at intervals of eight, 105.5, eight and 121.5 years, said Lau, adding that the last Venus transit was on June 8 in 2004 and the next one will be in June 3133.
The entire phenomenon will be widely visible from the western Pacific, eastern Asia and eastern Australia while most of North and Central America and northern South America will witness the beginning of the transit but the Sun will set before the phenomenon ends.
Malaysians will be able to observe the Transit of Venus when it begins at 06:09:29 and reaches the maximum phase at 09:29:28 and ending at 12:49:57.
Those in Sabah will able to observe the entire phenomenon because the sun rises before the transit begins.
Observers in Europe, western and central Asia, eastern Africa and western Australia will get to see the end of the phenomenon since the transit will be in progress at sunrise.
Lau reminded people to use proper safety filters when viewing the phenomenon to avoid permanent eye damage or blindness.
