Singapore - Sharing news on-the-go is even faster and more convenient with the release of the updated Stomp iPhone app.
This latest update - Version 1.6 - has several improvements.
Users no longer have to update their iPhones to iOS 5.1 or later in order to use the Stomp iPhone app. They will be able to install the app as long as their iPhone runs on at least iOS 5.0.
Bugs which caused the app to quit unexpectedly and affected the sharing of stories have also been fixed, ensuring a smoother user experience.
What's more, the separate loading of feeds means an improvement in speed, so users will be able to get their news fix in extra-quick time.
Regular users will be glad to know that the app still has the familiar loading screen with three buttons, giving users the choice to contribute a story, view the hottest news on Stomp or get to the Stomp homepage via a shortcut.
With the Stomp iPhone app, citizen journalists literally have the news at their fingertips as they can use their smartphones to snap pictures and record videos, and send them to Stomp with a short description.
The app also enables users to keep on top of the hottest talking points in Singapore, with reports and comments from other readers.
Users can share their thoughts and give reports on events almost in real time with just a few taps on their iPhone.
With such a user-friendly interface, it is no wonder that Stomp's iPhone app won the Best Mobile Application and Judges' Choice awards at the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation Awards last August.
Keep your finger on the pulse of the hottest news in Singapore and connect with other Stompers by downloading the free app from the Apple Store.
If you already have the app on your iPhone, remember to update it.
