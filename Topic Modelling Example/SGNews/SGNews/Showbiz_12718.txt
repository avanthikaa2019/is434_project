A group of British senior citizens (played feistily by the likes of Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and a particularly riveting Penelope Wilton) make their passage to India to live in a Jaipur retirement home that doesn't quite live up to its ostentatious name.
Expect wit and humour in this crowd-pleaser directed by John Madden, but the parallel story lines are wrapped up too neatly by the end of the ensemble film.
