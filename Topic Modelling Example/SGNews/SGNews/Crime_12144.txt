Two Malaysians have been charged for attempting to fix the result of a Malaysian Super League (MSL) football match between Singapore and Sarawak.
Businessman Thana Segar S. Sinnaiah, 38, and match referee Shokri Nor, 47, allegedly met in a hotel where Shokri agreed to receive a RM15,000 bribe (S$6,090) to fix the match result.
Shokri was replaced before the match at the last minute on May 22.
Sinnaiah, Shokri and two other individuals are assisting the CPIB in investigations.
The case will be heard again in court on May 31.
If found guilty, they face up to five years' jail, and/or a fine of up to $100,000.
In a statement released to the media, the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) thanked CPIB for their swift action.
It added: "We will continue to work closely with Football Asoociation of Malaysia (FAM) to combat aggressively this cancer of match-fixing/football corruption, in our respective jurisdictions."
