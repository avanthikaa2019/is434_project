A void deck once defaced by graffiti now boasts murals featuring artist Vincent van Gogh's paintings, thanks to a creative community project.
Singapore's first void-deck art gallery, at Block 56 in Pipit Road, is the result of Project Grace, which stands for "Getting Residents, Artists and the Community Engaged".
More than 350 volunteers came together over two weeks last July to complete the works of art, which include iconic paintings such as Starry Night and Sunflowers.
Since their completion, the estate has been cleaner and there have been no incidents of vandalism, said Mr Rajesh Singh Dhillon, 38, chairman of the MacPherson Zone C Residents' Committee (RC) and one of the project's leaders.
The civil servant said that "residents now feel a sense of belonging to their estate and even watch over the area to keep vandalism at bay".
His RC will be among seven to receive the People's Association (PA) Special Community Project Award on Saturday, PA said yesterday at its headquarters in King George's Avenue.
PA also announced that the number of grassroots leaders has increased by 5,000, or 16 per cent, over the last five years, to 32,000.
Mr Yam Ah Mee, chief executive director of PA, noted that more permanent residents and new citizens have joined the ranks of grassroots leaders, with an increase of about 10 per cent over the last two years.
There were about 1,600 permanent residents and 3,000 new citizens active in grassroots organisations last year.
