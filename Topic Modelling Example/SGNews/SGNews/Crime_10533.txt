NEW YORK - A mid-ranking UN official has been charged with sexual abuse, the New York City Police Department said on Wednesday, nine months after a former UN contractor accused the official of abusing her.
Dushyant Joshi, who works at the UN human resources department's emergency preparedness and support team, was arrested on Tuesday, a police official said.
Neither Joshi nor the United Nations responded immediately to requests for comment.
Joshi has been charged with third-degree sexual abuse, the police said. According to the New York State Penal Code, the maximum penalty for third-degree sexual abuse is three months in prison.
Joshi's arrest comes nine months after a female former UN contractor filed a complaint against him through the United Nations' internal justice system, and eight months after she said she filed a complaint with the police.
Reuters has obtained a copy of the complaint made to the United Nations, which accuse Joshi of forcefully kissing and touching the employee at a bar near UN headquarters in Manhattan on June 3, 2011.
On June 5, Catherine Pollard, the assistant secretary-general for human resources at the UN, informed the woman, whose contract ended in December, in writing that Joshi would be subject to disciplinary action.
Reuters has obtained a copy of Pollard's letter, which said that Joshi denied the allegations of sexual abuse.
Joshi's arraignment has not yet been scheduled, the Manhattan court clerk's office said.
