TOKYO - A huge storm left at least four people dead in Japan, officials and reports said Wednesday, as violent wind and rain battered the nation.
The storm is covering all of the north of Japan's main island of Honshu and much of the northernmost island of Hokkaido, buffeting the region with strong winds caused by what meteorologists say is a severe low-pressure system.
In Niigata prefecture on Honshu's northwest, gusts of up to 156.6 kilometres (97 miles) per hour were recorded.
At least four people died in the violent weather, the disaster management agency and local media said.
They included a 96-year-old man in Iwate prefecture who fell from the roof of a three-storey house during high winds and a 28-year-old woman in Miyagi who was hit by a falling tree, Jiji Press and NTV said.
The storm temporarily reduced electricity supplies to the Onagawa nuclear power plant, in Miyagi prefecture, halting the cooling system for a fuel pool, operator Tohoku-Electric Power Co. said.
Plant workers manually restarted the cooling system after about 20 minutes, it said. "There was no problem in the operation," a company spokesman said. All reactors at the plant are currently idle.
Transport systems were widely disrupted on Tuesday as the storm moved through Japan, with hundreds of flights grounded and train services cancelled.
