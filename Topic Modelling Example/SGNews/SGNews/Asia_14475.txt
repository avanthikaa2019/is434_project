JAKARTA - As students of SMP 198 junior high school in Duren Sawit, East Jakarta, were taking their national exams, many were seen looking back and forth between their test sheets and the ceiling above, worried that their school's decrepit roof may collapse on them.
"Seeing the condition, we're scared that the ceiling may collapse while we take the exams. We can't concentrate," said Tasya Julia, a ninth-grade student at SMP 198, on Monday.
The principal, Amer Manullang, said he had submitted a proposal for renovation funds but it had not yet been approved.
"We've already asked the government for funds. But you know the government &hellip; it's always short of money," Amer said as quoted by kompas.com.
"The school actually underwent extensive renovation in 2009. We should have had more work done in 2010. Maybe other schools are in much worse shape, so they may have been prioritized," Amer added.
Despite the 2009 renovation, some parts of the SMP 198 building are still in very bad condition.
The ceilings are so damaged that students can see the roof tiles through them.
The wooden poles supporting the building are also porous.
Many students have been evacuated for fear of injury. Twenty exam participants were moved into a cramped area, because one of the rooms was unsafe.
Whenever he hears students complaining, Amer can only tell them to be patient and wait for government funding.
The 4,000-square-meter school building, which was built in 1979, accommodates 800 students taking exams in 13 rooms.
