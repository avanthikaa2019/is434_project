Singapore emerged as the top nation at the inaugural South-east Asia Swimming Championships, which ended on Sunday at the Singapore Sports School.
It won 16 golds, 11 silvers and 13 bronzes, ahead of second-placed Indonesia (nine golds, 10 silvers, seven bronzes) and third-placed Malaysia (eight golds, nine silvers, eight bronzes).
But it was Vietnam's Nguyen Thi Anh Vien who emerged as the top swimmer at the championships, with five golds to her name.
The 15-year-old won in every event that she swam in - the 50m, 100m and 200m backstroke, and the 200m and 400m individual medleys - and met the Olympic "B" qualifying timings for all five events.
Indonesia's I Gede Siman was the top male performer with four first-place finishes. Singapore's top performer was Quah Zheng Wen, who had three golds and a bronze.
