A Singaporean firm director was provoked by a British project manager at a night club.
During the dispute, Alexander Lincoln Chew Yew Wah, 27, punched Briton Richard Jonathan Mills several times.
The fight occurred at the toilet at Filter Club at Robertson Quay, when Chew tried to jump the queue in front of Mills.
Mills hurled racist comments at Chew, telling him to go back to China.
Chew punched Mills until he fell to the ground.
He had to be warded at the Singapore General Hospital for two days after sustaining cuts near his right eye. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan also revealed he had damaged tissue.
Chew pleaded guilty to causing hurt during the incident on November 28, 2010.
Defence counsel Shashi Nathan said his client had been provoked, and asked the court not to impose a jail sentence.
Chew was fined $4,000.
