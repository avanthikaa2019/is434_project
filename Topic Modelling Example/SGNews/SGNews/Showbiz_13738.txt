Stage Whisper (Warner)
The barely-there wisp of a voice of this Anglo-French singer-actress screams Ice Queen on her fourth album, a collection of unreleased tracks and live recordings.
But there's something compelling about the way that voice caresses the melodies on songs like the atmospheric White Telephone and Anna. Listen out for the lovely collaborations, such as Memoir, with Villagers' Conor O'Brien.
