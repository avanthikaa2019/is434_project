PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - The Queens Park Rangers football club will be up against a Sabah selection in Kota Kinabalu on July 18 as part of their first Asia tour.
QPR chairman and AirAsia CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes called the pre-season tour a "fantastic opportunity" to showcase the QPR brand and bring the club to the golden stage, reported QPR's official website.
"To the best of my knowledge, no one has ever toured Sabah. I'm thrilled that we have remembered all the people that have helped AirAsia get off the ground by bringing QPR to Sabah."
Fernandes also tweeted about the event, tantalising supporters of the team with more information.
"All teams go to KL. We at AirAsia have not forgotten about all that was done for us," he said on the micro-blogging site.
The tour will commence on July 10 with Bangkok being the team's first destination.
The team will train at the former Suphachalasai National Stadium in central Bangkok before playing Thai All Star XI at the Ramajangala National Stadium on July 14.
