In a press conference on the missing Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner on Wednesday night, the official Indonesian agent for Russian aircraft maker Sukhoi, PT Trimarga Rekatama, announced that the ill-fated plane was carrying 50 passengers.
"The plane is carrying 42 invitees and eight crew members," PT Trimarga Rekatama chairman Sunaryo said.
However he did not announce names of the passengers.
"We have the passengers' list, but we have to double check since some of the invitees failed to go on board and some others, who are on board, are not listed in the invitee list," Sunaryo said.
He added that his company was continuing to coordinate with the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) to gain information on the missing plane.
Basarnas chief Vice Marshal Daryatmo said they would continue the aerial search tomorrow due to bad weather.
He added the Sukhoi Superjet 100 departed from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport at 2 p.m. to Pelabuhan Ratu, West Java.
It arrived back in Halim at around 2:20 p.m. for refreshment before departing again to Pelabuhan Ratu.
The last contact with the plane was made at 2:33 p.m., at 06 43' 08" South and 106 43' 15" East, located near Mt Salak, said Daryatmo.
