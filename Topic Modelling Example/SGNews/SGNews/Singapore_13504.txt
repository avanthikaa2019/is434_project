Another suspect in the underage sex scandal case is back in court.
31-year-old manager Chiang Meng Chuan appeared in court today for his second appearance, reported The Straits Times.
He allegedly paid between $500 to $600 to have sex with an underage girl at Hotel 81 Bencoolen on two separate occasions in September 2010.
He was one of more than forty men who were charged last month for having commercial sex with a minor. The girl cannot be identified due to a gag order.
Chiang's case has been adjourned until June 11. He is being defended by Mr Alan Shankar.
He faces a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, or both if convicted.
Only one man has been convicted in the case so far. Former Pei Chun Public School principal Lee Lip Hong is now serving nine weeks in jail for the offence.
