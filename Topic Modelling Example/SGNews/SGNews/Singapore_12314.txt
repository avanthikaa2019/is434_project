Prominent aesthetics doctor Low Chai Ling appeared in court today to appeal against her conviction in disciplinary proceedings.
According to The Straits Times, Dr Low, who founded aesthetics clinic The Sloane Clinic, was found guilty by a Singapore Medical Council (SMC) disciplinary committee of offering and performing treatments not generally accepted by the medical profession.
This includes aesthetic treatments such as mesotherapy and stem cell extract facial therapy. She was fined the maximum $10,000 and censured for the offence.
In September 2007, Dr Low received a letter from the Ministry of Health to raise concern about these treatments. As she continued to offer these treatments, MOH lodged a complaint to the SMC against her.
In her appeal, Dr Low said that these were generally accepted procedures.
Another well-known aesthetics doctor, Dr Georgia Lee, is to appear in court today to appeal against an order by the disciplinary committee asking her to pay the full costs of the proceedings.
Dr Lee had also been found guilty of similar professional misconduct charges for offering such treatments, reported The Straits Times.
