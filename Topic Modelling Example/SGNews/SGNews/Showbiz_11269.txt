DC Comics is introducing a gay version of the Green Lantern.
It shows him in a kiss with his partner in civilian life before he dons his skin-tight unitard.
Alan Scott is the gay Green Lantern in the title Earth 2, which goes on sale this coming Wednesday.
It will compete for attention with Marvel comics character Northstar, who will marry his boyfriend in an Astonishing X-Men issue to be released on June 20.
"I'm sure there will be some controversy, but nothing like it might have been 20 years ago," said Mr Gerry Gladston, the co-owner of Midtown Comics in New York.
"Comic books, after all, are among the greatest of American art forms and great art reflects life, doesn't it?"
Most comic fans know the Green Lantern's alter ego as Hal Jordan - a ladies' man played by Ryan Reynolds in last year's film - but Earth 2 is an alternate universe in the DC world, Reuters reported.
Alan Scott was also the name of the original Green Lantern introduced in 1940, and the character was named Hal Jordan when DC revived the Green Lantern in 1959.
As for Northstar, one of the X-Men mutants, he proposed to boyfriend Kyle Jinadu in the last issue of Astonishing X-Men, with the wedding being featured in the next issue.
The decision to introduce the gay character has reportedly not been well received by the group One Million Moms, who have called for a boycott of comic books featuring gay superheroes.
