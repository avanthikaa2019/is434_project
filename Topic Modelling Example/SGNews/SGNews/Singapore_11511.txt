SINGAPORE - Nominations for the inaugural 2012 President's Challenge Social Enterprise Award are now open until August 31. This award is the first and only one of its nature within the social enterprise sector in Singapore.
The award will be given out in three categories - Social Enterprise of the Year Award, Social Enterprise Start Up of the Year Award, and Youth Social Enterprise of the Year Award.
"I hope that through this award, the President's Challenge will inspire more individuals, particularly our youths, to develop business ventures that also serve social causes," said President Tony Tan.
The award was first announced in March this year to recognise successful and sustainable social enterprises that had made significant social impact in Singapore.
"[I] think the Awards will help social enterprises attract good talent as it gives us more visibility in terms of the viability of our business, the causes we champion, and us as an inclusive employer. We will definitely try to apply for the Awards this year," said Mr Richardo Chua, managing director of Adrenalin Events and Education.
