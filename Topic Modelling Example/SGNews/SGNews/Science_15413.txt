NEW YORK - Well over half of people globally use the Internet to search for information on entertainment and hobbies, according to a new survey.
The online poll of more than 19,000 adults worldwide in countries ranging from the United States, Argentina and Sweden to Japan, India and Russia showed that 57 per cent of people said they visit web sites for hobbies and other interests, 43 per cent downloaded music and 34 per cent searched for movies.
But usage in the 24 countries surveyed varied widely, with 72 per cent of people in Turkey saying they visited sites for hobbies, while only 35 per cent in Saudi Arabia did.
"While the internet may be a place for business and commerce, it is also a place for play," said Keren Gottfried, research manager at Ipsos Global Public Affairs which conducted the poll for Reuters.
Other heavy personal-interest, web-surfing nations included China, Hungary, Japan, South Korea and Sweden, while Argentina, Spain, India, Brazil and Mexico were among the lowest users.
China was the world leader in streaming or downloading media, with more than 70 per cent selecting music or movies, followed by Turkey. Japan and France had the fewest media streamers, according to the survey.
"It's remarkable to think that the file-sharing technology, popularised for music only in recent history, is now done by four in 10 internet users in 24 countries," Gottfried said. "Even in countries at the bottom of the global ranking lists, one quarter still do it."
Twenty seven per cent of people said they had played online games, reflecting what Gottfried called a booming industry, but only 13 per cent said they had gamed for money.
China was also first in online gaming, with 61 per cent.
Poland and Turkey were a distant second and third, while the Swedes were the least avid gamers at only 13 per cent. Overall 27 per cent of people questioned said they have played games online.
