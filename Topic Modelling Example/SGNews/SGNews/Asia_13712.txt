JAKARTA - An Australian teenage boy died in a snorkelling accident near Indonesia's resort island of Bali, police said Friday.
Jack McCabe, 16, from the Central Coast in New South Wales, arrived in Indonesia Thursday and was snorkelling with his family in Crystal Bay near Nusa Penida, an island around 30 kilometres (18 miles) east of Bali.
"The boy died on Thursday at around midday (0400 GMT)," Klungkung district police chief Tri Wahyudi told AFP.
"When the boy came to the surface, he hit his head on a moored boat and screamed. He then lost consciousness."
The boy's father took him to a nearby clinic but he died on the way, Wahyudi said.
The Australian Consulate-General in Bali was providing consular assistance to the teenager's family, Australia's department of foreign affairs and trade said in a statement.
