Residents had said that a lift upgrading project took two years to complete - the same time that it took to construct entire condominiums.
This was some of the feedback given to Member of Parliament Foo Mee Har (West Coast Group Representation Constituency).
In response, Minister of State for National Development Lee Yi Shyan said that the Housing Board is looking at ways to speed up the lift upgrading at estates without any compromise to quality and safety.
Under the lift upgrading programme (LUP), it takes six months to upgrade an existing lift and 16 months to build a new lift shaft with a new lift in it.
Housing Board contractors are also limited by construction hours and must be mindful to minimise disruption to residents.
Mr Lee added that the LUP is on track to be completed by 2014.
