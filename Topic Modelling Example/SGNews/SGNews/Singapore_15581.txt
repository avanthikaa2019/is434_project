The Housing Board is looking into ways to speed up its Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) without compromising quality and causing too much inconvenience to residents.
Since 2007, the time needed to construct new lifts in a block has been reduced by two months, thanks to the use of pre-fabricated lift shafts made of steel, said Minister of State for National Development Lee Yi Shyan.
The steel shafts can be more easily assembled on site than concrete ones.
More recently, the HDB has reduced the time needed, to four months from six months, during the service-diversion phase of LUP, said Mr Lee. It has done so by streamlining the coordination between multiple agencies.
He was replying to a query by Ms Foo Mee Har, an MP for West Coast GRC, on whether the time needed for LUP could be shortened.
Residents in Pandan Gardens had asked her why an LUP project takes two years to complete, she said.
Mr Lee said: "It takes about six months to overhaul an existing lift, and about 16 months to build a new lift shaft with a new lift in it."
He added that the LUP is on track to be completed nationwide by the end of 2014. Some 5,000 HDB blocks were selected, with work completed on about 65 per cent of them.
Mr Lee said HDB is studying the possibility of carrying out LUP on a block-by-block basis, instead of working on a few blocks at a time.
