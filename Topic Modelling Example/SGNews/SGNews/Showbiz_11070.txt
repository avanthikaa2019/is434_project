SYDNEY - Australian "Hunger Games" actor Liam Hemsworth has proposed to "Hannah Montana" girlfriend Miley Cyrus, with the pair tweeting their engagement on Thursday.
"Thank you for all the support. We are both very happy!" said the Melbourne-born Hemsworth, who met the teen star in 2009 while filming "The Last Song" after relocating to the United States to pursue his career.
Cyrus, 19, tweeted: "I'm so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with @LiamHemsworth!!!"
Hemsworth, 22, who is currently shooting "Empire State" in New Orleans, said the ring was "hand-cut around 1880 or 1890 and it's unique and in its original form".
"It's a contemporary design based on vintage aesthetics. The light flashes and sparkles no mater where she moves her hand," he said.
Cyrus made her name as a teen idol in the "Hannah Montana" TV series but moved to shake-off her squeaky-clean image when she quit the show with raunchy music videos.
