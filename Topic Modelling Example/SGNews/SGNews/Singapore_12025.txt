A cyclist who was hit by a lorry at Changi Coast Road this morning has died.

After the lorry hit the victim, it eventually stopped about 200 metres away.
The victim died on the scene.
Police are investigating.
Another man was found dead in Changi Coast Road just last week.
Last Saturday, Mr Jason Peter Quek, 38, was found dead in an area off the same road. He was said to be out riding his motorcycle that night with his friends. His body was found 100m from his motorbike.
The police received a call for help at about 5pm that day but only found the body in a forested area off the cycling track at 9pm. Paramedics declared him dead an hour later.
Changi Coast Road is a popular trail among cyclists for its shady, straight and uninterrupted cycling path of more than 7km. The route is considered an easy one.
