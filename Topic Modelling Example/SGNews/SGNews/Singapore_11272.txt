French fashion designer Roland Mouret has voiced his dismay over what he described as poor fashion sense of the Singaporeans.
"I saw quite a lot of fashion disasters' in the hotel (where I was staying), especially men dressed in the wrong shorts with flip-flops," he was quoted as saying in an interview with Yahoo! Singapore, which was then reported in Sin Chew Daily.
Mouret was in Singapore recently for the Audi Fashion Festival 2012.
He said the republic should ensure that hotel guests adhere to a proper dress code.
