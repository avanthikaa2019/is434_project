WASHINGTON - US Secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Saturday said Washington was committed to working with the Rwandan government toward reconciliation as she marked the 18th anniversary of the genocide.
"The United States stands in solidarity with the Rwandan people, and we admire their resilience and the enormous strides they have made in recovering from that unspeakable event," said the top US diplomat, marking the killings of 800,000 people over roughly 100 days of bloodshed in 1994.
"We are committed to working with the government and people of Rwanda to complete their recovery and move forward toward a future of reconciliation, economic growth, peace, and better lives," said Clinton in a statement.
Around 800,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, were murdered mainly by Hutu militias.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame meanwhile Saturday accused unspecified Western countries of failing to apprehend people suspected of involvement in the genocide.
"As we remember those we lost, some of those who killed them are still moving freely in some capitals of the so-called free world," said Kagame.
