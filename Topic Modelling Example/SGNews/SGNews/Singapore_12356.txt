A maid was found dead at the foot of an HDB block in Sembawang yesterday morning.
Her employer, known as Madam Goh, told The Straits Times that she suspects that this is due to an attempt by her Myanmar maid to run away.
The maid, 24, had fallen out of the 13th-storey flat's kitchen window and was found motionless at the foot of Block 421, Canberra Road at about 6.20am. She was declared dead on the scene by the paramedics.
The police are investigating the case as an unnatural death.
The maid had been working with Madam Goh's family for about two months, and was its second maid. Her duties included housework and taking care of Madam Goh's wheelchair-bound father.
However, she was found to be defiant and did not follow instructions. Hence, her employer had already asked the agency to take her back. She then agreed to stay on until a replacement came.
Madam Goh, who had woken up at 6am only to find the maid missing, said she didn't sense anything wrong before the incident. She related that the maid had even wished them good night before going to bed at about 10.30pm the night before.
Saying the maid knew where the keys to the front door and gate were, Madam Goh said she would rather the maid had used the gate to run away, instead of the window.
