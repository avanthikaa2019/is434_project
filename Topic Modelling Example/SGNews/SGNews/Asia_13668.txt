A passenger of a Singapore Airlines A380 jet flying from Sydney, Australia, to Singapore, which made an emergency landing in Jakarta on Friday, has died of suspected heart attack.
State airport operator Angkasa Pura II's Hari Cahyono confirmed the news, saying that the body was being handled by the airport medical unit (KPP).
"However, we have yet to identify the passenger -- the name, the nationality, etc," he told The Jakarta Post.
"The pilot contacted Soekarno-Hatta airport's tower to ask for landing permission when it was flying over Bali because one of its passenger needed emergency first-response," state airport-operator Angkasa Pura II executive director Tri Sunoko said in a statement sent to The Jakarta Post.
The Straits Times reported that the passenger and a companion disembarked in Jakarta at 4.46pm local time (5.46pm, Singapore time).
Tri said the plane, which was carrying 280 passengers and 26 crew members, managed to land on Runway 07-L and parked at Apron WC-1.
The airplane also refueled at the airport.
Tri said that the evacuation process went well and that the plane flew to Singapore at 5:50 p.m., around two hours after the emergency landing, without two passengers.
It was the first time that an Airbus A380 has landed at the airport, which was previously believed to be not feasible for such a large aircraft.
The airport aims to expand its capacity from 22 million passengers per year to 62 million by 2014.
