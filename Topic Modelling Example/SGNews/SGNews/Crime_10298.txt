Two teenagers who ransacked the home of an elderly couple in Alor Gajah left with a loot of RM300 (S$127) in cash, two handphones and a lawn mower, but not before giving their victims some "parting advice".
Retired teacher Md Amin Ismail, 74, relating the incident to Harian Metro, said one of the robbers "advised" the duo not to live at home on their own.
"Before they left, one of them told us that we are old and that we should live with our children," said Md Amin, who was injured by a machete during the robbery at 3.30am on Thursday.
Md Amin said the assailant held the weapon to his neck and tied up his hands.
His wife, Fatimah Mohamad, 80, had a piece of cloth stuffed into her mouth. She, too, was tied up.
It was the second time this year that the couple have been robbed.
In February, they were robbed by three people and lost about RM10,000 in cash and jewellery.
