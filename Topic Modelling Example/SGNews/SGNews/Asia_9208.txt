KITAKYUSHU - About 180 people were evacuated after police found a cache of weapons, including what appeared to be a rocket launcher, during a search of a storehouse in Kitakyushu on Thursday.
A bomb disposal squad removed the weapons at about 10:40 p.m., allowing the residents of 93 households in Tobata Ward to return home.
According to the Fukuoka prefectural police, the two-story wooden storehouse was being searched in connection with an insurance fraud case. At about 2 p.m., they found the apparent rocket launcher, five handguns and more than 50 rounds of live ammunition.
The metal rocket launcher was about seven centimeters in diameter and 70 centimeters long. It contained an object that likely was a rocket, according to the police.
The police are investigating the case as a suspected violation of the Explosives Control Law and the Firearms and Swords Control Law.
The suspect in the fraud case has reportedly not made any comment about the weapons.
