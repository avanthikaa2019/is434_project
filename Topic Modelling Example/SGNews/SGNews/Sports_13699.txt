30 students will be among the pioneer batch of the Tampines Football Academy.
Set up a week ago, the academy will see Tampines Rovers stars like Aleksander Duric, Fahrudin Mustafik as well as professional coaches training the youth football enthusiasts and providing opportunities to compete in friendly matches and going for overseas training.
The programme especially emphasises on reaching out to needy youth and youth-at-risk in the district.
Youth from low-income families are eligible to apply for a registration fee subsidy.
One of the key features of this academy is how it uses football to motivate youths to do well in their examinations.
The academy which is open to youths all over Singapore, will work closely with schools to ensure that its participants are doing well in school.
To proceed further with their football training, participants must at least attain a pass in their examinations.
In addition, the North East Community Development Council (CDC) will be offering subsidised tuition sessions to those who do not do well in school.
Aleksander Duric, Captain of Tampines Rovers also added that "It is important for them (the youths) to know that they have to do well in school. Most of them like playing football and do that almost every day but at the expense of their school work and grades. It is like a player, if you do not do well in your training and do not fulfill training hours, you sit out of a match."
