SYDNEY - Police were Friday hunting for a gang of Sydney street robbers who throw faeces at their victims to distract them before grabbing their money.
They have been linked to at least three crimes so far, which involved them hurling the excrement just after people withdraw money from the bank, then offering to help clean it up. While doing so, they swipe their cash.
In one incident, they made off with AU$30,000 (US$30,700), and in another more than AU$8,000, police said.
"These robberies are vile and sickening in their nature and we are doing everything we can to catch those responsible," Detective Inspector James Deeley said in a statement, urging people to be extra vigilant.
