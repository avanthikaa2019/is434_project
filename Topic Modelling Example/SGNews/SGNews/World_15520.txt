HAMBURG, GERMANY - Low water levels on parts of the Rhine in Germany still mean vessels cannot sail fully loaded on some northern sections of the river, traders said on Tuesday.
Water levels at Cologne remain below levels at which vessels can sail with full holds after recent dry weather, traders said.
Vessels on other parts of the river are operating normally with full loads.
Rain is forecast for river catchment areas from Tuesday night to Thursday which could improve the picture, traders said.
Water levels on the Danube in Germany were normal, they said.
The Rhine is an important shipping route for commodities including grain, minerals, coal and oil products including heating oil.
It is a major route for Switzerland's commodity imports.
