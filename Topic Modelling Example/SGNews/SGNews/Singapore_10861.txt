SINGAPORE - Stamp lovers will now be able to buy Singapore's first-ever legal tender stamps and First Day Covers illustrating the milestones of the country's co-operative movement.
Launched by President Tony Tan Keng Yam, the stamps tell a story of how co-operative social enterprises were formed to address social issues that had arisen in periods of Singapore's history for over 86 years.
The unveiling of the stamps took place at Co-opaliciouz, an event that witnessed the largest gathering of co-operative members, staff and families in the history of Singapore.
It attracted more than 15,000 people who came together at the Marina Barrage to celebrate the United Nations International Year of Co-operatives (UN IYC), and learnt about the co-operative movement's social impact on a country where one in three Singapore Residents are members.
Through this event, the Singapore National Co-operative Federation (SNCF) hopes to raise public awareness of the value of co-operative social enterprises as a regulated model of self-help and part of Singapore's multi-layered social safety net, said Ms Dolly Goh, Chief Executive Officer of SNCF.
