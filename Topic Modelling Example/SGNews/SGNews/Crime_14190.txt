A 32-year-old woman suspected of nine scam cases was arrested yesterday morning.
The suspect had preyed on the compassion of victims saying that her husband was hospitalised and she needed money urgently.
The unsuspecting victims loaned her amounts ranging from $50 to $450 believing that she would repay them the next day as promised. After collecting the money, the suspect became evasive and uncontactable.
Police had earlier issued an appeal for information on April 24, and received information of the female suspect's address at Bangkit Road.
The suspect will be charged in court tomorrow for cheating. She could face a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.
Police advise the public to be wary of similar scams and not to part with their money or valuables easily, especially to strangers.
