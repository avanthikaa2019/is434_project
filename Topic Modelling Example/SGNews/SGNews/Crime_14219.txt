ALOR STAR - A police constable on sentry duty at the Kedah Istana Anak Bukit palace here was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds yesterday.
A policeman with the rank of lance corporal was arrested in Perlis, about three hours after the 5.45pm shooting.
The body of Mohd Sobri Md Sidek, 22, was discovered sprawled outside his guardpost by a palace worker who had gone to check on what he thought was firecrackers being let off in the palace grounds.
Two M16 guns were found near the body.
It was learnt that the victim had an argument with his supervisor, a lance corporal, before his body was discovered.
The supervisor, 25, from Perlis, could not be located on the palace grounds after the shooting.
Police believe one of the guns had been used in the shooting.
State police chief Datuk Ahmad Ibrahim said the victim, from Malacca, died on the spot with wounds in the face and chest.
"The palace worker went to the guardpost after he heard the sounds of what appeared like firecrackers being let off. After stumbling on the body, he contacted the police," he said.
Ahmad said Sobri had earlier reported for the 3pm to 7pm shift duty to his supervisor.
The suspect was arrested at his village in Simpang Empat, Perlis, about 9pm the same day.
Meanwhile, chief secretary to the Sultan of Kedah, Datuk Syed Unan Syed Mashri Syed Abdullah, said the sultan, who is also the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, was saddened by the incident.
"The incident is the first of its kind in the palace's 76-year history."
