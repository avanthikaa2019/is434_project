After a long run of success in recent years, followed by a steep 70 per cent fall in profits this first quarter, a suitably chastened HTC is ready for a comeback.
Its recently released One X is a cutting-edge smartphone with quad-core processor, 4.7-inch screen with 720p HD resolution, and the current best in smartphone camera and sound reproduction. And it has the latest Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).
There is much that is good about the One X.
The powerful NVIDIA Tegra 3 1.5GHz processor allows it to function almost like a computer.
Every task is performed expeditiously and it makes the iPhone 4S seem like a laggard by comparison.
The new 8MP camera deploys in 0.7sec and auto-focus in 0.2sec. With prolonged pressing of the shutter, it can take 99 continuous shots at four frames per second.
Sound reproduction is by way of Beats Audio Technology, which is found in higher-end headphones.
The One X does not have a micro-SIM slot but this is not really a huge drawback as it comes with 32GB of built-in memory. And users get 25GB of Dropbox storage free for two years.
Although I am a long-time iPhone user, I have to acknowledge that the One X is the closest any Android smartphone has come to matching the Apple device in terms of performance and user interface.
If I were to ever drift away from iOS, the HTC One X would be a viable substitute.
