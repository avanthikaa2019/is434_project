COST pressures are piling up for Singapore's electronics sector, with some listed companies reporting lower profit margins.
The slump in the sector, which contributes more than a third of Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, comes as the central bank warned that the industry would be a drag on economic growth and flagged severe price erosion for electronics firms.
Nine of 15 electronics manufacturers - including Venture Corp, Hi-P International and STATS ChipPAC, the biggest in the sector by market value - reported declines in quarterly profit margins from January to March.
Shares of Singapore tech firms have fallen about 9 per cent over the past month, according to StarMine's aggregate for the companies, worse than the 4 per cent drop in the FTSE ST Mid Cap Index and the 8 per cent drop in the FTSE ST Small Cap Index.
