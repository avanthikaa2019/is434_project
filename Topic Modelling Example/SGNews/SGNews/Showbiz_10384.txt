Award-wining actress Angelica Lee Sin Jie has refuted claims she is pregnant, China Press reported.
She said that while she wanted a baby it would not be this year.
The Malaysian-born actress, 36, was rumoured to be pregnant but showed no such indication during the shooting for her upcoming movie which involved dangerous acts.
Lee was recently back in the country for the launch of the latest product for the SK-II beauty care line, for which she is the brand ambassador.
Lee said she took leave from work to look after the daughter of her husband Oxide Pang, and had to seek psychiatric help as she lacked the experience in dealing with a baby.
