Saudi Arabia's hopes of Olympic showjumping glory this summer could be hit hard amid a doping probe into two of the country's top jumpers, the Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday.
Khaled Al Eid, a bronze medallist at the 2000 Sydney Games, and Abdullah Sharbatly, world silver medallist in 2010, face International Equestrian Federation tribunals in Lausanne and may miss the Games, after winter tests of their mounts showed use of banned anti-inflammation products.
