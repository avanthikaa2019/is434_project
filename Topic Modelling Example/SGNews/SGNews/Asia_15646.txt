The Tokyo metropolitan government will hire retired public servants and others for a fixed period to be dispatched to the three northeastern prefectures hit hardest by the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami.
The recruitment process will start in late April, and those employed will undergo a training program and be sent to the three prefectures--Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima--in September for up to five years to support reconstruction work there. No age limit will be set for applicants, metropolitan government officials said Friday.
The Tokyo government will solicit retired public servants and also experienced private-sector people from a wide range of sectors.
