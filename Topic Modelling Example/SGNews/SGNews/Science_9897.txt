DARMSTADT, Germany - German scientists have uncovered copulating turtle fossils, according to news reports.
The turtle couples, which belonged to an extinct species known as Allaeochelys crassesculpta, are believed to have died from poisonous volcanic gas.
Walter Joyce of the University of Tuebingen, who made the shocking discovery, said it was the first time that fossils of copulating vertebrates were found.
The fossils were discovered at the Messel Pit fossil site near Darmstadt in Germany. The site is famous for its abundance of fossils, which scientists believe is because of volcanic gasses from nearby lakes that killed ancient animals.
Joyce said that the ancient turtles started mating in habitable surface waters, but during the process sank into deeper portions of the lake that were toxic. They perished when their skin started to absorb the poison.
Joyce's findings were published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.
