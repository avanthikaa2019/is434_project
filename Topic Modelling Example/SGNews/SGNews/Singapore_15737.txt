SINGAPORE - Fancy some extra ingredients in your soup?
While most of us will not normally complain when a food stall is generous with their portions, this netizen is saying "No, thanks."
Netizen hellogoodbye was shocked when he found a dash of extra soggy newspaper when he tucked into his favourite bowl of watercress soup.
Appalled at the unbelievable discovery, he wrote in citizen journalism website Stomp with some photos as proof.
He said that he had bought a bowl of soup to take away from popular food stall, Johnson Lock Roasted Duck &amp; Chicken, located at Clementi.
The stall is known for its roast meats and double-boiled soup.
hellogoodbye said that he patronised the stall almost every day for the past few weeks because he heard about the health benefits of double-boiled soups.
"To my surprise and disgust, I saw a large piece of newspaper dangling from my spoon when I scooped up the soup.
"I dug even further to try to see if there was more than just that in my soup, and there was in fact more bits of newspaper," said hellogoodbye.
He was concerned if the ink from the newspaper would be toxic.
When he found the 'extra' ingredients in the soup, he immediately stopped consuming it. He has also since stopped buying soup from that stall.
"Some people might think I'm being paranoid or petty complaining over a few bits of newspaper in my soup, but can you really blame me for simply expecting basic hygiene from a food stall - better yet, one from a well-known chain?," hellogoodbye added.
