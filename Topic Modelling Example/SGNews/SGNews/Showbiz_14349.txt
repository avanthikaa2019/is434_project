Three of the '80s most celebrated artistes will join Katy Perry, Maroon 5 and Jay Chou in the list of performers lined up for the Singapore Formula One (F1) weekend.
Race organisers on Wednesday confirmed acts Bananarama, Pretenders and The Proclaimers, who will each perform at least two gigs during the F1 event from Sept 21 to 23.
Bananarama, who became famous for their hits like "I Heard a Rumour" and "Love in the First Degree", will perform on Saturday and Sunday at the Marina Bay Street Circuit's Esplanade Outdoor Theatre Zone 4 and Village Stage Zone 1 respectively.
The singing-songwriting duo from UK have clocked a cool 30 million in record sales throughout their 33-year illustrious career and are Guinness World Record holders as the female group with the most chart entries.
Fan of punk, new wave, rock and pop hits? You'll definitely not want to miss the Pretenders and the signature vocal stylings of front-woman Chrissie Hynde, so be sure to head down to the Village Stage Zone 1 and Esplanade Outdoor Theatre Zone 4 during that weekend.
Rounding up the list are Scottish twins, The Proclaimers. Fans of the popular sitcom, How I Met Your Mother, will know them from their biggest hit "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" which was featured in one of the episodes.
They will also be releasing a new album next month called "Like Comedy". Check out their unique blend of pop, folk and new wave during their set at the Village Stage Zone 1 on Friday, and Esplande Outdoor Theatre Zone 4 on Saturday and Sunday.
