JOHOR BARU - An all-women foreign gang posing as healers and fortune-tellers, have been relieving gullible housewives of their money and jewellery in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah and Taman Johor Jaya here.
The latest victim, 55-year-old Chuah Ju Kiow, of Taman Ungku Tun Aminah, claimed to have lost RM42,000 (S$17,228) in cash and jewellery after being cheated by the two middle-aged women from China.
She said the two women took her to see a woman who claimed to be an agent of a "master" with supernatural abilities to ward off evil spirits.
Chuah said the third woman convinced her that her daughter would face bad luck in three days.
"She asked me to pack all my money and jewellery in a bag with rice.
"When I met her with the bag, she chanted something and touched my left hand. When I opened it 10 days later, it contained two packets of salt, two water bottles and some old newspapers," said Chuah at a press conference organised by the Malaysian Consumers Protection Council here yesterday.
Another woman identified only as Madam Liew claimed she was nearly conned by the women.
