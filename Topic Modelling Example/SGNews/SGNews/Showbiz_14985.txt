KUALA LUMPUR - Teen sensation Greyson Chance, who will be performing live at KL Live Centre at 8.30pm tomorrow, is all-geared up for his performance here.
Chance, who is on a three-day stop in here is excited about the concert tomorrow.
"This is my second time in Malaysia. I am here on a tour and I am super excited about my performance tomorrow at KL Live," he said at a recent interview.
On what he thinks about the Malaysian fans, Chance said: "Don't tell my fans back in the (United) States, but the fans in Asia are much more crazy."
Chance first caught the public's attention when a video of himself covering Lady Gaga's Paparazzi went viral on YouTube, attracting 45 million views worldwide.
The 15-year-old singer has since released his first single Waiting Outside the Lines in October 2010, while his debut album Hold On 'till the Night was released in August last year.
