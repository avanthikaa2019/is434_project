BRUSSELS - World powers will hold a fresh round of nuclear talks with Iran in Istanbul on April 14, a spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Monday.
"We have agreed to launch talks in Istanbul on April 14," Michael Mann said.
"We hope that this first round will produce a conducive environment for concrete progress.
"We are of course aiming at a sustained process," Mann added.
Iran last held talks with the so-called P5+1 powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - in January 2011 with no results.
There had been a dispute as to whether the venue for the fresh talks should be Istanbul or Baghdad.
