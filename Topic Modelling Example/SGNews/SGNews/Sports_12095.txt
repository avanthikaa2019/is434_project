NEW YORK - Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant and league MVP LeBron James highlight the National Basketball Association's All-NBA First Team which was announced on Thursday.
That trio are joined by Chris Paul and Dwight Howard.
For Bryant, it marks his seventh consecutive and 10th All-NBA First Team selection.
Durant, who edged Bryant for the scoring title with an average of 28 points per game, earned 117 first team votes.
James received 118 of 120 first team votes to make his fifth-consecutive team.
He led Miami in scoring (27.1 points per game), assists (6.2 assists per game) and rebounding (7.9 rebounds per game).
James also shot a career-best 53.1 per cent from the floor this season.
The second team consists of guards Russell Westbrook and Tony Parker, forwards Kevin Love and Blake Griffin and centre Andrew Bynum.
The third team comprises guards Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade, forwards Carmelo Anthony and Dirk Nowitzki and centre Tyson Chandler.
This is Chandler's second award this month as he was recently named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year.
The All-NBA teams are chosen by a panel of 120 media throughout North America.
