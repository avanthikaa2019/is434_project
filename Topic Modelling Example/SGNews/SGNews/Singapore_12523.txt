SINGAPORE - Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang launched a multi-pronged offensive against the men in white at WP's first rally for the Hougang by-election.
Who were his targets?
Mr Low spoke in Teochew to Hougang residents: "DPM Teo said that if you (Hougang voters) vote for PAP's Desmond Choo, Low Thia Khiang will still be coming to Hougang to serve you and to speak up for you.
"So he's telling you...buy Desmond Choo, and you'll get Low Thia Khiang for free.
"But I want to tell DPM Teo that if you want to sell your candidate Desmond Choo, that's your matter, Hougang people won't buy."
He drew Hougang's residents attention to the campaign booklet distributed by the PAP.
Low said in Mandarin: "This booklet documents many things that he (Desmond Choo) has done.
"For example, he wants to help provide the elderly in Hougang with better medical service, better home amenities and to offer children here with better pre-school, primary and secondary school education.
"All these are part of the government's ongoing assistance scheme.
"But he actually lists them in his election manifesto.
"A basic question that you have to ask is: Where does the money come from?
"Is it out from his own pocket? Or is it from PAP's fund? Desmond Choo uses your money, taxpayers' money to fund these programmes and he's claiming credit for all of that."
Low said: "PAP candidate Desmond Choo said that he can be an independant voice in Parliament.
"What he meant was that even though he is standing under the PAP ticket, he is his own man."
But he questions if Choo can be truly independent?
"There is a party whip for every party who has a MP in Parliament.
"When a party has taken a stand on a particular policy, all MPs in the party has to toe the party line.
"And given how PAP chairman Khaw Boon Wan has expressed his concern over disunity in WP, do you think he would allow Desmond Choo to do anything to disrupt the party's unity?," said Low.
