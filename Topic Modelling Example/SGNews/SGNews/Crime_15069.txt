A certified public accountant was ordered yesterday to pay a penalty of $51,760 for under-reporting his income.
This is twice the amount of taxes undercharged.
On top of this, Freddie Chin Kek Khiong, 66, also had to pay a $4,000 fine for committing the offence.
Chin pleaded guilty to two charges of understating his actual income for Years of Assessment 2006 and 2007.
The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) said that Chin "had without reasonable excuse under-reported income of $100,600 and $54,972 respectively."
Iras added that his under-reporting was discovered through one of its regular audit programmes that "targets a cross-section of industries and professional groups".
For committing the offence, on top of paying the penalty, he could have been jailed upto three years and fined up to $5,000 for each charge.
