"I don't have the guts to be a politician," admits Datuk Michelle Yeoh, quashing rumours that she is joining Malaysian politics.
"Being an actor is hard enough," the former Bond girl states her case. "I believe in good causes, but will leave politics to the professionals."
Aside from being born into a politician family (her dad Datuk Yeoh Kian Geik is a well respected political figure in Ipoh, Perak), a close encounter with US Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton in Washington DC during a special screening of The Lady has made Michelle realise how complicated politics can be.
"From a public figure to a politician - it's a difficult transition," the Malaysian superstar actress opines. "As a politician, you are accountable."
Having said that, she loves playing iconic Myanmar freedom fighter, Aung San Suu Kyi in The Lady.
"I find her inspirational," the actress enthuses. "She puts her people above herself and her family. She's taught me to be a better person, to be less selfish. Life is not always about 'Me' or what 'I Want'."
Stressing that The Lady is not a political movie, Michelle explains, "It's a love story. It's about an incredible husband who truly understands his wife, and how she has chosen to stay put with her people.
"It's about a difficult journey in life for Suu Kyi - she's a mum who had to watch her children grow without her and her husband dying without her."
Directed by Luc Besson and distributed by GSC Movies, The Lady will be released in selected cinemas in KL, Penang, Ipoh and Malacca on May 3.
