Despite the pressure and the time needed, many people feel compelled to share their lives through social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram and Pinterest.
And Harvard University researchers think they know why, reported the Los Angeles Times.
The act of disclosing information about oneself triggers the sensation of pleasure in the brain - the same feeling we get when we eat, get money or have sex.
Lead researcher Diana Tamir and her co-author, Dr JasonP. Mitchell, devised a series of experiments to measure the reward response that people get when they talk about themselves.
In one experiment, they hooked up test subjects to a magnetic resonance imaging machine and watched their brain activity as they answered questions about other people's opinions.
Brain more engaged with self The researchers found that the areas of the brain associated with reward - the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area - were strongly engaged when people were talking about themselves and less engaged when they were talking about someone else.
They also found that their subjects would turn down money (just a few cents) to talk about someone else, in order to enjoy the more pleasurable sensation of talking about themselves.
For the second part of the study, the researchers wanted to find out how important it is to have an audience listen to one's self-disclosure.
As anyone with 700 Facebook friends might have guessed, the researchers found greater reward activity in the brains of people when they got to share their thoughts with a friend or family member, and less of a reward sensation when they were told their thoughts would be kept private.
Dr Tamir said: "I think the study helps to explain why people utilise social media websites so often. I think it helps explain why Twitter exists and why Facebook is so popular."
