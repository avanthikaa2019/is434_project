A 28-year-old Malaysian driver might face the death penalty in Singapore after a joint operation between Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) foiled an attempt to smuggle in 500g of 'Ice'.
The driver was behind the wheel of a Malaysia-registered vehicle at Woodlands Checkpoint entering Singapore at around 6am.
During the routine check, a CNB officer found a tissue behind the passenger seat to be unusually heavy.
When he removed the cover of the box he found a bundle wrapped in black masking tape.
It was found to contain four packets of substances believed to be crystal methamphetamine, also known as 'Ice.'
The driver was arrested and under investigation for drug importation. If convicted, he may face the death penalty.
