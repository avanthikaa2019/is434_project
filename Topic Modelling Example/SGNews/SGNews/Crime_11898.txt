An accomplice of Rudi Husada, who according to the police is the alleged TVRI journalist killer, said that Rudi was known as the wealthiest man in his village in Jabung district, East Lampung.
"Rudi has the largest house in the village", his accomplice, Hendra Yudha, who was arrested last Saturday in Karawang, said as quoted by kompas.com.
Furthermore, Hendra, who admitted that he had been Rudi's partner in stealing motorcycles, confirmed that Rudi was the kind of criminal who would threaten victims who attempted to interfere.
"I've worked with him six times. The last time involved the [TVRI journalist] shooting," Hendra said.
As of now, Rudi remains at large. The police have established teams to hunt him down.
On March 17, a senior reporter with TVRI, Djuli Elfano was fatally shot in front of his house at Vila Bintaro Indah, South Tangerang, when he tried to stop the perpetrators from stealing his motorcycle.
Djuli had reportedly left his house to buy a new battery for his car when he spotted two people trying to steal his motorbike, which was parked on the side of the street in front of his house.
