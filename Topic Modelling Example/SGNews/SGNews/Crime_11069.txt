A 16-year-old's revelations on a TV talk show has implicated her father in a triple murder committed four years ago, Tamil Nesan reported.
In a crime show aired a week ago, the teenager said her father, A. Murugan, had killed three people in 2008.
Television channel Zee Tamil, based in Chennai, had invited the 16-year-old to take part in a show on real life crime stories on May 17.
The girl said her father had poisoned a young couple and the woman's father and buried their bodies at the back of the house.
After the show aired, a woman made a police report in Villupuram stating that her husband, A. Sekar, her daughter S. Lavanya and her lover A. Silambarasan had gone missing over three years ago.
A police team dug up the remains of the victims from the village. Police said Murugan had killed the trio after they wanted him to return the jewellery they had given him for safekeeping. He poisoned their food and buried their bodies in the backyard of his house.
Murugan's wife Rajeswari said that on the way back to the village after the show, her husband had got down at Tindivanam and said she would never see him alive again.
Police are still searching for him.
