SINGAPORE - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has agreed to fund the anti-doping education initiatives at the 2013 Southeast Asian Games to be held in Myanmar.
Under the UNESCO's Fund for the Elimination of Doping in Sport, some US$45,000 (S$57,000) can be utilised to develop and implement anti-doping initiatives that include education programmes, athlete outreach and workshops for stakeholders.
Having an athlete outreach programme for the upcoming SEA Games is an essential step in the fight against doping in sports within Southeast Asia, said Mr Gobinathan Nair, Director General of Southeast Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organisation (SEA RADO).
"It is very encouraging to receive this funding as it will be the first time that we will be having an athlete outreach programme in the history of the SEA Games," he said.
He also announced that there will be a booth set up during the games to allow both athletes and coaches to take part in various activities including computer based quizzes that will challenge their knowledge about anti-doping.
There will also be anti-doping experts present to answer questions and clarify doubts.
CEO of SSC Lim Teck Yin expressed confidence that the effort will strengthen anti-doping processes and procedures within Southeast Asia.
"Every sport is about the integrity of the game on the field and the fairness of the competition," he said, adding that the use of performance-enhancing drugs provides unfair advantage in a playing field.
"We will be able to pool together ideas and expertise from anti-doping authorities around the world to enhance the capabilities in testing and education," he added.
"Athletes within the region will be better equipped with the knowledge and resources to ensure they do not resort to performance enhancing drugs to win."
