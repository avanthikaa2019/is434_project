SINGAPORE - A Vietnamese national was jailed for two years for cheating on Friday, after he was found guilty of selling fake iPhones to victims.
Nguyen Van Huu, 33, pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating.
He conned customers at mobile phone shops across Singapore into handing over between $800 to $1,250 for what they believed to be genuine black and white Apple iPhones last October.
He netted $7,680 in eight cases of cheating, between Oct 20 to 25 last year.
His alleged accomplice, Tong Thi Ngoc Minh, 27, has been charged but her case is pending.
Tong's lover, Vo Minh Duc, 25, and Nguyen's good friend, was given six months' jail by the same court on Friday for dishonestly receiving a stolen sum of $3,352 at Hotel 81 in Geylang last Oct 23.
The court heard that while in Vietnam, Nguyen had persuaded the two of them to travel to Singapore to sell made-in-China imitation iPhones.
Nguyen had an original black iPhone and Tong, a white one, which they brought to Singapore on Oct 18.
He could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined on each charge.
