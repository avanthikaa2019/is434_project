A couple killed and chopped up a Hindi movie producer after he harassed the woman, Makkal Osai reported. The woman and the producer had worked closely and they also managed a dancing academy.
However, the producer had feelings for her and started to pester her several times.
The man continued with his harassment although he was warned by the woman's husband to stay away.
The paper said that on June 6, the couple lured the producer into their house, telling him they were hosting a cocktail party.
The couple plied him with alcohol until he was drunk. They then killed him by severing his head and limbs.
The producer's butchered body was found about a week later.
