Deputy Speaker Mr Charles Chong will be in Phnom Penh, Cambodia from April 1 to 4 for parliamentarians' meetings related to the 20th ASEAN Summit.
He is representing the Singapore Parliament at the ASEAN InterParliamentary Assembly (AIPA) meetings. This will lead up to AIPA's meeting with the ASEAN Heads of Government/State on the third of April at the 20th ASEAN Summit.
Parliamentarians representing the 10 AIPA member parliaments will utilise the meetings to agree on a statement that will be delivered at the AIPA meeting with the ASEAN Leaders.
The AIPA meeting with the ASEAN Leaders at the ASEAN Summit has been an annual event since 2009 as part of ASEAN's wider efforts to engage parliamentarians and a spread of civic organisations and interest groups.
