SINGAPORE - Troubled tour agency Far East Travel &amp; Lifestyle has come forward to say that it will compensate its customers.
One of the directors of the company, Mr V. Retnasooria, told The Straits Times that they will get a full refund by the end of May.
Mr Retnasooria gave the assurance: "My customers are entitled to be upset. I'm going all out to make sure every one of them is paid."
His tour agency - located at Little India - has been accused of failing to make hotel and ferry bookings for the travel packages that were sold online.
According to its company records, 317 customers are owed $29,700.
From March last year to January this year, the company put up for sale about 8,000 packages online to destinations like Bali and Phuket - all were snapped up.
But the problem came when one of the company's employees, who was in charge of ferry bookings quit last December, explained Mr Retnasooria. She left behind a list of reservations that were incomplete.
When the online sites received complaints about the travel agency, they started to withhold payment and Far East Travel, in turn, ran short of money to pay for hotel rooms.
At least three group-buying websites - deal.com.sg, streetdeal.sg and shiokdeal.sg - have told The Straits Times that Far East Travel owes them at least $145,000 for money paid out to customers in refunds or for alternative accomodation.
But Mr Retnasooria claims that the websites owe him $203,000.
He also attributed the lapses in payment to his involvement in other businesses, reported The Straits Times.
More than 35 people have lodged police reports in the past month and the Consumer Association of Singapore has received 45 complaints since July last year.
A Singapore Toursim Board (STB) spokesman said it has met the company's management twice 'to ensure it will take appropriate action to resolve the complaints'.
