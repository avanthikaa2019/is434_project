AsiaOne's health and women's websites, YourHealth (www.yourhealth.com.sg) and Diva (www.divaasia.com), are the top websites in Singapore in their respective categories.
The websites once again topped Web-traffic list Experian Hitwise last month, emerging No. 1 in the Experian Hitwise categories of Lifestyle - Women's Sites, and Health and Medical - Information, respectively.
Both sites are part of AsiaOne, a Singapore Press Holdings leading news and lifestyle portal which features content from Singapore and the region.
Experian Hitwise is an online measurement company that monitors Internet usage.
Based on latest figures, Diva's page views have grown by 135 per cent since the start of the year.
Since its relaunch early this year, YourHealth has seen a 50 per cent growth in page views, with its comprehensive news coverage on medical developments, health issues and feature stories.
AsiaOne editor Adrian Tay attributed the performance to the team's understanding of what readers want and are looking for.
"A key factor is being able to know what would resonate with readers, being able to provide news and information in a timely manner, and to package them in a way that is easily accessible," said Mr Tay.
