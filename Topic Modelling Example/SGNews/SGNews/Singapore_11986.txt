SINGAPORE - Speaking to the media after the Hougang by-election results were announced, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said that the results are not a reflection of Singaporeans' sentiments towards the ruling party, as Hougang does not represent the whole of Singapore.
He was replying to a question by a reporter of whether the Hougang results are an indication of people's sentiments towards the PAP one year after the General Elections (GE) and the changes that the Government has made since then.
"I think the elections in Hougang is quite special, as Hougang is not representative of the whole of Singapore necessarily. Because each constituency is different, and Hougang has its own characteristics," he said.
He added that PAP did expect a very difficult fight in Hougang, but that they are encouraged by the fact that more residents have "seen and supported Desmond's vision of a new future".
He said that this is a good beginning.
He highlighted that the election results are the view of the Hougang voters, and the constituency is known to be a "very strong Worker's Party stronghold."
The outcome of the by-election saw PAP candidate Desmond Choo securing 37.91 per cent of the vote, up from 35.2 per cent last year.
WP's Png Eng Huat secured 62.09 per cent of the vote.
The final results showed that WP had won the by-election with 13,447 votes, out of a total of 21, 657 votes.
While Mr Choo acknowledged that there is "lots of work to be done", he believed that the outcome was "an affirmation that our work is moving in a correct direction".
After speaking to the media, the PAP went inside for a closed-door meeting at its Hougang branch office
Outside, labour chief Lim Swee Say was heard agreeing with a supporter that a 3 per cent increase is still an improvement.
This is the second loss for Mr Choo, 34, who was beaten in the 2011 General Election by Yaw Shin Leong, 36.
