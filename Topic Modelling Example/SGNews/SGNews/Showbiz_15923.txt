Fans of the American Pie teen comedy series (1999-2003) may have waited almost a decade for this fourth instalment, but they can rest assured that, while the actors may be older, their antics are still childish for the sake of laughter.
Most of the original cast (from Jason Biggs to Alyson Hannigan, Seann William Scott and John Cho) are back for this high-school reunion with a sloppy storyline studded with trademark sexual jokes.
Let's hope this is the last hurrah.
