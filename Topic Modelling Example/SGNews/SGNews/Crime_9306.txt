A Thai national has been jailed four months for working here as a pimp and managing a brothel.
The 30-year-old, who earned five times more than he used to as a waiter in Thailand, was charged with assisting a vice syndicate, living off immoral earnings, and managing a brothel.
According to the Straits Times (ST), police arrested Rueangvutthikorn Rattanapanangsakul during a raid of a Beach Road apartment on May 8.
Four Thai women, who were on one-month social visit passes, were also arrested.
The court heard that various agents were involved in providing free air travel for the women to come here as prostitutes.
Rueangvutthikorn was paid $1,000 monthly on top of his air travel, lodging and food expenses.
His job was to have the women settled in an apartment brothel.
The women would provide sexual service to the first 28 men for 90 minutes each without receiving payment, ST said.
The men would be charged between $140 to $160 but the women could only extract half of the fees for themselves after the first 28 services.
Rueangvutthikorn said through his lawyer that he wanted to earn more money to better support his parents.
The court was told that he could only earn $100 to $200 a month as a waiter in Thailand.
