SINGAPORE - A Myanmar maid was received a three month jail sentence for criminal intimidation on Tuesday, April 10, reported The Straits Times.
The court was shown a video of the maid, Su Su Hlian, 31, throwing a knife on the sofa where her four-year-old charge was sitting.
The maid then pointed the 20cm blade at the frightened child.
The court also took into consideration another charge of the maid slapping and pulling the hair of the child.
The parents became suspicious when the child cried in the mornings when they left for work. The girl also said she did not want to be fed by the maid.
The parents became suspicious and installed a spy camera in the flat.
On the evening of the following day, when they saw footage of the abuse, the father lodged a police report.
