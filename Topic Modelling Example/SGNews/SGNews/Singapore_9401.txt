SINGAPORE - The teenager behind an online extortion scam was today sentenced to 24 months' supervised probation.
Yap Siew Ting, 17, had pleaded guilty to extorting $150,000 from a 22-year-old man and attempting to extort $10,000 from a 24-year-old, by threatening to upload nude videos of them over the Internet.
Her alleged boyfriend, Alexander Soh Zhi Ren, 22, was her accomplice to the offences carried out in May last year and February this year.
Yap had logged into internet chatroom Alamak.com where she would chat with men. She would then move the conversations to a private webcam chat.
While engaging in conversations with sexual overtones, she got the men to remove their clothes, and Soh, who had hooked up a separate monitor by then, used his iPhone to record the men undressing.
The men stripped not knowing that they were being recorded,
The couple would then confront the victims with the video clips, threaten to upload the videos on the internet and demand money in exchange for not uploading.
The Straits Times reported that under the probation order, Yap has to perform 130 hours of community service and remain indoors from 10pm to 6am.
Yap's case will be reviewed by the court in November.
