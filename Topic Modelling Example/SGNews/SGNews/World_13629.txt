CAIRO - Egypt's military prosecution on Saturday ordered 179 people be detained over deadly clashes between troops and anti-military protesters in Cairo, a military source told AFP.
Following the arrest of 320 people after Friday's clashes outside the defence ministry in Cairo, the prosecution &ldquo;has decided to hold 179 people, including 13 women, for 15 days pending investigation,&rdquo; the source said.
After five hours of questioning overnight, the detainees were accused of assaulting army officers and soldiers, assembling in a military zone, and preventing members of the armed forces of carrying out their work, the source said. They all denied the charges.
Friday saw fierce clashes between anti-military protesters and troops in the Abbassiya neighbourhood near the defence ministry, that left two people dead, including a soldier, and nearly 300 injured.
The clashes erupted just three weeks ahead of Egypt's first presidential elections since a popular uprising ousted president Hosni Mubarak last year.
