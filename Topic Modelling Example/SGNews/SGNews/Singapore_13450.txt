Singapore and Colombia signed an air-services agreement yesterday to give flexibility to their respective airlines to operate any number of direct passenger services between the two countries.
Both countries' airlines can also operate, subject to certain restrictions, up to seven weekly passenger services and seven weekly cargo services between and beyond the two countries.
