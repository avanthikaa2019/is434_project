HAIYANG, China - Hosts China outpaced rivals Thailand to top the medals table at the Asian Beach Games as it wrapped up Friday, ending the third edition of an event featuring some obscure seaside sports.
The hosts won 14 gold medals and 35 overall medals, compared to 13 golds and 29 overall for Thailand at the event, which saw more than 2,000 athletes gather at China's eastern seaside city of Haiyang.
Athletes from 45 Asian countries including Japan, Kazakhstan and Yemen competed in the event that showcased beach sepaktakraw a cross between volleyball and soccer and beach kabaddi, a highly physical mix of tag and wrestling.
Among the more mainstream sports at the seven-day event were sailing and beach volleyball, with athletes in those sports honing their skills ahead of the 2012 Olympic showdown later this summer.
In beach volleyball, Indonesia boosted its hopes for London by beating Kazakhstan for the men's title, while Thailand defeated China to take the women's gold medal.
But it was the more obscure sports that wowed the crowds in Haiyang.
In sepaktakraw, Thailand dominated, winning all four gold medals on offer, while Iran won the championship in men's kabaddi and India took the women's title.
Other sports at the Asian Beach Games included powered paragliding, where athletes wearing a propeller on their back sit on a seat below a paraglider, and take to the skies to show off their flying and landing skills.
The next Asian Beach Games will be hosted by Thailand in 2014, organisers said.
