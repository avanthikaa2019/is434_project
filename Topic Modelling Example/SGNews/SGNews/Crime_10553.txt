86 people were arrested during an islandwide operation conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) from June 11 to 13.
Out of these, 79 were taken in for alleged drug abuse while seven were arrested for suspected drug trafficking.
In total, 22 Erimin-5 tablets, 30 grammes of heroin and 18 grammes of crystal methamphetamine or 'Ice' were found and seized.
Among those arrested, a 54-year-old was apprehended from an HDB unit in Toa Payoh for trafficking activities. 14 grammes of heroin were found in the flat, along with 21 straws and two mobile phones .
Four other people, suspected to be the man's clients, were later arrested from the same area in a follow-up operation. They were between the ages of 44 to 63.
If convicted for drug trafficking, the alleged drug trafficker could be sentenced to five years in jail and five strokes of the cane.
CNB says it will continue to intensify enforcement efforts to emphasise a zero tolerance stance towards drug abuse.
