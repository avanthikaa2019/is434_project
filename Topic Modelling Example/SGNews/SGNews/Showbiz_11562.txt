No one ever thinks they'd be caught in a life-threatening situation because it only happens to others, right?
But on Tuesday, when former beauty queen Lina Teoh became a statistic, she realised that school of thought is so wrong and closer to home than one thinks.
"We always think that horrible things don't happen to us until it happens and then we think we should have thought more about it (safety precautions).
"I've replayed that scenario through my mind so many times, and now on hindsight it's easy to say what I should've or shouldn't have done.
"But at the time, I felt compelled to help the poor uncle on the ground, and got out of the car," recalled Teoh of the incident.
The Miss Malaysia/World 1998 was driving near the Jalan Duta roundabout towards Jalan Kuching at 10.30am when she was involved in an accident with a motorcyclist, who is in his 50s.
He demanded RM300 (S$122) for damages and medical bills, but "he didn't seem to be physically hurt".
Another man then arrived and advised her against giving the motorcyclist any money, but he later started to make advances towards Teoh.
"It was a complete Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde moment. He became aggressive and increasingly ham sap (perverted)."
Teoh managed to get back into her car, and drive off.
Looking back, Teoh said she doesn't know what would have been the best thing to do but "I've been advised to not get out of the car and to drive to the nearest police station."
That's the advice Teoh hopes to impart to other single female drivers.
"I was reacting on impulse rather than being rational.
"So what's important for women is to be mentally prepared. Use your smarts to get out of the situation.
"Don't worry too much about learning martial arts because you shouldn't use physical force unless you really know what you're doing.
"It can make a situation potentially worse," said the documentary filmmaker, who is now more wary and vigilant of her surroundings, and "not taking my safety for granted."
