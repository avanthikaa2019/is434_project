Fearing that his dishonest practices would be exposed by a vegetable seller whom he had cheated in New Delhi, an astrologer set him ablaze to "silence" him.
Parvez Sharma, 23, had earlier deceived the 35-year-old vegetable seller known as Ishtikar into parting with his money by offering predictions on ways to get rich.
When Ishtikar realised that he had been cheated, he had wanted to report to the police, Malaysa Nanban reported.
However, Parvez got wind of his intention and enlisted the help of a friend. They invited Ishtikar to Parvez's office and spiked his drink.
Ishtikar became unconscious after taking the drink.
The two men then took him to another place and poured petrol on his body. They burnt him and hid the body among some bushes.
