CHICAGO - France's new first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, Monday said she had been given some precious tips on her new role by Michelle Obama, as she eyed a future as an ambassador for equality.
"What interests me, is the beginning, the children, equal opportunity," she told reporters after a visit to a French school in Chicago, where NATO leaders held a summit.
"There is an expectation and we are getting huge amounts of letters from associations. I'll look into it, little by little."
Trierweiler, who has raised eyebrows as she is not married to new French President Francois Hollande although the couple have been together since 2007, confirmed she did not intend to give up her career.
A twice-divorced 47-year-old journalist and mother of three teenagers she plans to continue her media career and combine it with her first lady role.
"I've given up being a political journalist, so that's done, but I am still counting on carrying on," she said Monday.
Trierweiler also said that she had been impressed by her first meeting with America's First Lady Michelle Obama, who welcomed her to the White House with the other spouses of the G8 leaders.
"She is really one of the people who has impressed me the most in my life," Trierweiler said.
"She has incredible presence, and an amazing charisma. She could also launch a political career," she added, thanking Obama for her "warm welcome" and "her precious advice" on the role of the first lady.
