Members of the public can call a new hotline to contact the National Environment Agency (NEA) should they come across public-cleanliness problems.
Launched yesterday, the hotline (1800-600-3333) is run by NEA's new Department of Public Cleanliness, and will help to deal with issues such as cleanliness at bus stops.
