High on drugs and craving for more, a man in Teluk Intan beat up his wife, stripped her and tied her to force the woman to give him money for his fix, Sin Chew Daily reported.
She was tied overnight and only released when she pleaded that she had to send their children to school in the morning.
The father of four, in his 30s, took pictures of his naked wife before freeing her.
The victim has since fled with the children to take refuge at her mother-in-law's house out of town.
However, the man's mother, fearing for the safety of her daughter-in-law and grandchildren, has moved them to another relative's house.
"My daughter-in-law wants a divorce and I support her. She wants to stay with me and bring up the children with me.
"I hope the police will detain my son and send him to a drug rehabilitation centre," the older woman said, adding that a police report had been lodged against the man.
Police confirmed that a report was lodged against him on Sunday, the same day the man made a report to get back his children.
