KUALA LUMPUR - Police said the allegation of illegal human organ harvesting in Malaysia as reported last year is not true.
Federal CID director Comm Datuk Seri Mohd Bakri Zinin said this after a probe by police showed there was no evidence to prove that hospitals in Malaysia were involved in organ harvesting.
"We worked with the Health Ministry and Interpol and found that the claims are untrue," he told said during a press conference yesterday.
Ministry director-general Datuk Seri Dr Hassan Abdul Rahman was also present.
Comm Mohd Bakri said it was not easy to remove organs from a person's body as the process was time-consuming.
He said police had not received any reports on the matter.
Dr Hassan said the ministry would not tolerate such activities in any hospital in Malaysia.
It was reported on Sept 21 that Malaysia was among several countries investigated by Bangladeshi police in connection with an international syndicate linked to illegal kidney trade across several South-East Asian countries.
Investigators had identified a reputable international hospital with branches in key regions and capital cities, including a hospital in Malaysia.
Initial investigations revealed that donors from remote villages in Bangladesh were flown in to the said places to sell their kidneys.
Joypurhat Superintendent of Police Mozammel Haque was reported as saying that police had information of an international hospital's involvement.
The hospital has branches in India, Malaysia and Indonesia.
It was said that each victim was paid between US$2,000 (RM6,360) and US$3,000 (RM9,540) for a kidney, but he was unsure how much the organ was priced in the black market.
