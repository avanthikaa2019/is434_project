MALAYSIA - Amid controversy surrounding his win at the recently concluded Anugerah Bintang Popular, Singaporean hottie Aaron Aziz proved his love for Malaysia by joining the country's fights against AIDS.
The Ombak Rindu star, alongside singer Bob Yusof (of Akademi Fantasia fame), are the latest additions to the Malaysian AIDS Council's growing stable of Red Ribbon Celebrity Supporter - comprising Datuk Siti Nurhaliza, Datin Paduka Umie Aida, Faizal Tahir, Fahrin Ahmad, Dayang Nurfaizah, Owen Yap, Shah Shamshiri, Zainal Alam Kadir, Joey G, Aanantha, Uthaya and Winnie K.
"It's my way of giving back to (Malaysian) society for what they have given me," enthuses Aaron. "Thank you Malaysian AIDS Coucil for giving me a chance to do something good."
Well, certain fraternity in the Malaysian entertainment industry has questioned Aaron's contributions to his adopted country, but the hunky actor insists he is not perturbed by "petty issues" revolving around his nationality. Or Malaysia and Singapore.
On his new role as a Red Ribbon celebrity supporter, the 36-year-old says, "My focus is on helping teenagers. It's a crucial period in one's life. I know because when I was a teen, I was excited about trying out a lot of things."
