It's official.
Chinese actress Gong Li and Singaporean businessman Ooi Hoe Seong have been divorced for three years.
In an interview with West China Daily, Mr Ooi broke a long silence on the issue and said: "We are still good friends and call each other during Christmas and Chinese New Year."
He added that he and Gong Li, 46, drifted apart due to their different careers. Rumours of their split started brewing in 2010, but back then, Gong Li brushed aside the speculation.
When quizzed about recent news of Gong Li dating a French cameraman 13 years her junior, Mr Ooi said he did not know anything about it, but would "sincerely wish them well" if such reports turn out to be true.
