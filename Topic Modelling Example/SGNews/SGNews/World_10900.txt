LONDON - Britain's 90-year-old Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, left hospital on Saturday after five days of treatment for a bladder infection.
The prince shook hands with staff, smiled to reporters and nodded when asked if he was feeling better as he left King Edward VII Hospital in central London in time to celebrate his 91st birthday on Sunday.
Philip was taken to hospital on Monday with a bladder infection in the midst of the queen's diamond jubilee celebrations, less than six months after he needed treatment for a blocked coronary artery.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Philip would be spending his birthday "privately" after he was taken from the top London hospital in a Land Rover with police escort.
The prince had suffered chest pains during the Christmas break and had to undergo a medical procedure for his blocked coronary artery.
