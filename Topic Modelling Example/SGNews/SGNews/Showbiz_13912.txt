Get set for the hottest boys in K-pop in a one-night-only musical extravaganza.
Slated to run over 21/2 hours, Boyz Nite Out will feature some of the best names on the South Korean music scene. The concert will take place on June 15, with the first artist kick-starting the show at the Singapore Indoor Stadium at 7pm.
Boasting a stellar line-up of chart toppers, from singer Jay Park to idol groups SHINee, Teen Top, B1A4 and the much- hyped new band 7.9.4.2, Hallyu fans are certainly in for a visual and musical treat.
