Mr Desmond Choo, the People's Action Party (PAP) candidate for Hougang, said that the warmth he has received from residents there has made him feel like "part of the family".
During a 15-minute interview with the media at Block 24, Hougang Avenue 3, yesterday evening, he said that he had deep conversations with the residents, and "understood the kind of environment that they're living in, and their thoughts and feelings resonate with me".
The 34-year-old added that he felt like he was "part of Hougang" when long-time residents there expressed their appreciation of his presence.
When asked whether he felt that comments from PAP heavyweights would aid his campaign for the single-seat ward, he said that the by-election was about "selecting between two candidates".
He was referring to himself and Mr Png Eng Huat, 50, the Workers' Party candidate.
Mr Choo said that his schedule over the next few days would be nothing "extraordinary".
He said: "Work that has to be done, will still have to be done."
Yesterday, the Workers' Party encouraged supporters through its Facebook page to join the party members on Nomination Day tomorrow. Hougang's 25,000 voters will go to the polls next Saturday, if there is a contest.
