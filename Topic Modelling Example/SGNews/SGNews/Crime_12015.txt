An 18-year-old girl is currently being investigated for making a false police report.
According to the police, she had made a police report claiming that she was walking along Boon Lay Way when an unknown male Indian came from behind to snatch her handbag containing cash amounting to about $30 and other personal documents, and thereafter fled on foot towards Jurong East Street 13.
In the course of the investigation, the police detected numerous discrepancies. When interviewed again, the girl admitted that she had lodged a false report.
She told the police that she was scared of being reprimanded by her mother if she finds out she lost her handbag out of her own carelessness so she made up the story instead.
Investigations against her are ongoing.
Anyone who is convicted for giving any information which they know to be false to a public servant shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.
Commander of Clementi Police Division, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Melvin Yong warned that Police would take stern action against anyone giving false information to a public servant and thus expending police resources that could otherwise be put to better use.
