PETALING JAYA - Marina Tan Hsien Wei showed off her gift of the gab to emerge as the first Malaysian champion in the ESU International Public Speaking Competition 2012.
The 18-year-old student bested 53 other international participants in a nail-biting grand final at Dartmouth House, London, on Friday.
It was fantastic and very unexpected. Everybody was very good and I was really impressed by all of them. This has been a really good week, Marina told The Star via telephone yesterday.
My mother, aunt and uncle screamed in delight when the results were announced, she said before rushing off for a bus trip to Oxford and Cambridge with her family.
They did not plan any celebration over her win, opting instead to enjoy their last moments in London, Marina added.
The former SMK Methodist Girls Penang student won the chance to show off her verbal prowess after clinching the top prize of a five-day, four-night all-expense-paid trip to London in The Star-ESU Malaysia-SEGi Public Speaking Competition last month.
With the theme The Head or the Heart', Marina wowed the judges with her speech on youth activism titled The Game Changers.
Since the countrys participation in the international competition in 2003, Malaysian representatives have entered the final stage six times, in which Jean Lee, Wong Xiao Qing and Siti Khadija Jaafar bagged awards in 2003, 2004 and 2009 respectively.
English Speaking Union (ESU) Malaysia chairman Tunku Dara Naquiah Tuanku Jaafar described the win as truly a lovely gift for ESU Malaysia in conjunction with its 10th anniversary.
The competition is a popular programme by ESU, an international charity founded in 1918 with the aim of fostering international understanding through the English language.
The Malaysian segment of the competition is jointly organised by The Star, ESU Malaysia and SEGi University College.
