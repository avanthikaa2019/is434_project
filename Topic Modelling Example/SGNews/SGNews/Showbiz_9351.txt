A common love for rock instrumentation brought five youngsters together to create their own definition of music from the heart.
Made up of Nur Amira Khairil Anuar, 20, Jayme Lim, 20, Muhammad Shahrin Syazwan, 21, Muhammad Khair Safaruan, 21, and Niki Koh, 20, Bear Culture started out in Republic Polytechnic as a band under an IG (Interest Group) in 2010.
But soon, they decided to take the band beyond school grounds.
Although still considered young on the Singapore indie music scene, the alternative rock band played at Baybeats last year and impressed audiences with original songs like Cheesecake and Valkyrie.
Bear Culture will be playing at Ignite Music Festival, an annual student-driven event at the Republic Polytechnic, for the first time next month (July 7).
LOUD caught up with guitarist Muhammad Shahrin to talk about the band's upcoming album and their participation in Ignite.
To be honest, we named the band after our audio engineer friend.
He is this really big and hairy man who resembles a bear and we named the band in his honour as a joke in the beginning.
After a while, the name stuck and here we are as Bear Culture!
It was definitely one of the highlights in our life as a band.
It taught us a lot about how festivals run at such a high level with international bands and the like.
We met a lot of cool people, too.
As a band, we feel that every gig counts, no matter how big or small.
Every second on that stage will help you improve your craft in terms of playing under pressure, performing and dealing with technical surprises.
We're still in the process of recording demos.
We're trying out different recording and production techniques for every song to see how our ideas would come out on the record.
Otherwise, we have about 12 songs written for the album and we're itching to get it done!
Definitely! Ignite is such a huge show and we're honoured.
