SEOUL - The rivalry between Apple and Samsung has intensified, if leaked news of a new Galaxy Note II turns out to be true.
The South Korean electronics giant is said to be launching a phablet - devices bigger than smartphones but smaller than tablets - in October to compete with Apple's next smartphone, dubbed the iPhone 5.
The Galaxy Note II will reportedly have an unbreakable- plane display, which means the phone will be thinner, MK Business News reported.
The new device is also said to pack a larger screen than its predecessor, whose display measures 5.3 inches. It will also feature longer battery life, better build quality and a quad-core processor.
Technology-news website CNet said the phone will have the next version of Google's Android operating system, known as Android 5.0 Jelly Bean.
