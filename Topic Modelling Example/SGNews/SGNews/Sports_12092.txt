SINGAPORE - Two years after coming in second in the biennial SportBusiness Ultimate Sports City awards, Singapore came in sixth in this year's awards.
Despite the absence of a multi-sports international competition last year, the Republic held off strong competition from Tokyo, Pyeongchang and Kuala Lumpur to retain its position as Asia's best sports city.
In 2010, it came in second behind Melbourne, due in part to its successful hosting of the Youth Olympic Games.
Melbourne lost out on top spot this year, ceding the prize to London, host city for the Olympics this year.
Another Australian city, Sydney, finished third.
New York climbed from 10th in 2010 to fourth, while Manchester rose from seventh to fifth.
Cities are assessed on criteria such as the number of federations hosted, the calibre of events bid for, facilities and venues, transport, accommodation, government support, security, legacy, public sports interest, quality of life, marketing and use of social media.
