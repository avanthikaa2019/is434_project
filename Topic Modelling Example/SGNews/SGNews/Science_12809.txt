SINGAPORE - Photographer Joey Lim was so hyped up over Blizzard Entertainment's highly anticipated Diablo III title that she turned up at its launch event yesterday dressed as a game character.
"I'm a fan of the game's storyline," said the 27-year-old, who was brimming with excitement at the event held at Funan DigitaLife Mall.
She told my paper that she even bought an Alienware gaming desktop computer recently in order to enhance her gaming experience with Diablo III.
Ms Lim was among hundreds of fans who turned up between 9am and 9pm, forming queues which snaked around the exterior of the mall.
Die-hard fan Seth Chan, 24, was the first one in the queue, setting up camp on Monday at 6am.
Mr Chan, who works as a clerk, stood in queue for about 33 hours.
He had completed the first two instalments of the game multiple times.
And the first thing he planned to do after buying the game?
"I'm going home to sleep. That's for sure. I haven't slept properly in two days," he said with a laugh.
