KUALA LUMPUR - Two suspects who posed as prospective clients to lure a real estate agent into a condomi&shy;nium unit in Mont Kiara where she was later sexually assaulted have been detained.
The duo turned out to be husband and wife. Both the 33-year-olds were arrested at 11pm in Petaling Jaya, said City CID chief Senior Asst Comm Datuk Ku Chin Wah.
SAC Ku said the two had been remanded until June 6.
In the May 11 crime, the woman suspect contacted the victim and expressed interest in viewing a condominium unit in Mont Kiara.
They met in the evening at the condominium, where the suspect turned up with her husband.
Once they entered the empty condominium unit, it was believed that the man dragged the victim into a room while his female accomplice waited in the living room.
The 34-year-old victim claimed she was stripped naked and tied up before being molested and assaulted.
The suspects escaped with the victim's Toyota Vios, taking her mobile phone, laptop and RM200 (S$81).
