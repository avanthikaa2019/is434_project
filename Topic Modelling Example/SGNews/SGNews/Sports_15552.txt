YAMAHA'S Jorge Lorenzo won the season-opening Qatar MotoGP Grand Prix after snatching the lead from defending champion Casey Stoner with just over three laps to go on Sunday.
Australian Stoner led for most of the race after overtaking Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa on lap two and pole-sitter Lorenzo on the next lap, but put his defeat down to a muscular contraction in his right arm that made it hard for him to grip the throttle and steer.
