SINGAPORE - A 38-year-old man responsible for a series of theft cases at Redhill Close was nabbed yesterday, thanks to the help rendered by two public-spirited passers-by.
On May 2, at about 3.25pm, Mr Goh spotted the suspect loitering around and looking into the cars at the carpark of Blk 75D Redhill Road.
Mr Goh then alerted his son, who subsequently called the police.
The duo then confronted the suspect and waited until the police arrived. Upon arrival, the suspect was found to be in possession of three cash cards and one mobile phone.
He was unable to give a satisfactory account of how he had in his possession the mobile phone, and was placed under arrest.
The suspect will be charged in Court on May 4 for the offence of Fraudulent Possession under Section 35(5) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order &amp; Nuisance) Act.
If convicted, he faces a fine of up to $5,000, a jail term of not more than two years, or both.
Acting Commander of Clementi Police Division, Superintendent of Police Rosalind Khoo, commended the father and son duo for their public-spiritedness and thanked them for their assistance.
She added that this highlights the importance of police-community partnership in the fight against crime.
