SINGAPORE - Aspiring footballers can get a chance to be scouted by former Manchester United players Paul Parker and Denis Irwin, as well as LionsXII coach V. Sundramoorthy, at the end of this month.
As part of Nike's The Chance, a global football talent search by the sports-apparel company, an open trial will be conducted on April 28 and 29 at the Ministry of Education's Physical and Sports Education Branch in Evans Road.
The trial will seek to select 100 players for next month's Country finals.
Parker and Irwin will attend the April 28 trials to help iden- tify talented young footballers with Sundram, who leads the scouting programme for The Chance in Singapore.
Five Singapore players will eventually be selected to take part in the Southeast Asia regional finals in Jakarta in June, competing with other players from Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia for four slots in the August global finals in Barcelona.
The global finals will be attended by Barca head coach Pep Guardiola, and the top 16 players will win a four-week training tour with the likes of Man United.
Players aged 16-24 can register by setting up a page on The Chance app, available from www.facebook.com/nikefootball. They can also register by calling 6570-6315.
