SYDNEY - Australian authorities on Thursday denied keeping an &ldquo;inhibited&rdquo; list of travellers after a lawyer who has represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said she was stopped before boarding a flight.
Jennifer Robinson, who advises Assange and WikiLeaks, said her check-in at London's Heathrow airport on Wednesday was delayed &ldquo;because I'm apparently &lsquo;inhibited' - requiring approval from Australia House to travel&rdquo;.
Australia House is home to Canberra's diplomatic mission in London.
&ldquo;(The) security guard (said) &lsquo;you must have done something controversial because we have to phone the embassy',&rdquo; Robinson said on Twitter.
&ldquo;Please explain: what is the &lsquo;inhibited' travel list? And why am I on it?&rdquo; she added in a tweet directed at Australia's foreign office.
The immigration office in Canberra issued a statement declaring that &ldquo;no Australian agency prevented Ms Jennifer Robinson from boarding her flight at Heathrow Airport in London earlier today.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Further, no Australian agency manages an &lsquo;inhibited' list.&rdquo;
Robinson, a human rights lawyer, acted for Assange in his extradition proceedings in Britain and recently appeared for WikiLeaks in a pre-trial hearing for Bradley Manning, who is accused of leaking sensitive documents to the group.
She was reportedly flying home to Australia to speak at a conference and appeared to have been able to board her flight.
