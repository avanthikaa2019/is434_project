Madrid - Tired of making your bed every morning? A Spanish furniture maker, OHEA, has started selling a Smart Bed that basically makes itself in the morning - automatically.
When set on "automatic" mode, a panel on each side of the bed swings open three seconds after the last person gets out of the bed, said OHEA.
Two mechanical arms with rollers then extend and grab each side of the comforter before moving slowly from the foot to the head of the bed.
At the same time, the pillows at the head of the bed rise on another panel to make room for the moving arms to pull the comforter under. The pillows are also straightened using attached cords on either side of the bed.
Once the comforter has been stretched to the head of the bed, the pillows fall back onto it. The side panels then close and the bed is ready for the next person. The entire bed-making process takes about 50 seconds from start to finish, according to OHEA.
The company has not released pricing details for the bed, which comes with two comforters, two bottom sheets, and four small pillowcases.
