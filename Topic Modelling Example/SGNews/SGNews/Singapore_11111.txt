The three women who had requested for sexual favours from the former chief of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) have been named in various reports. However, their identities have not been confirmed yet.
According to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), Peter Benedict Lim Sin Pang is charged with corruptly obtaining sexual gratification on a total of ten occasions from two female vendors and one potential female vendor to the SCDF in return for tenders on IT-related contracts.
If found guilty, the three women may also be charged.
According to Lianhe Wanbao, lawyer Amolat Singh said that the women involved have also broken the law, and are likely to be charged. They face either a fine of up to $100,000 or a maximum jail term of five years, or both.
Lim has not made any plea yet. If he pleads guilty, he is likely to only face three charges, according to reports.
The other seven charges will be taken into consideration during his sentencing.
The three charges are for accepting sexual offers on May 2, 2010 with Pang Chor Mui; on October 18 to 21,2011 with Lee Wei Hoon; and on April 20, 2011 with Esther Goh Tok Mui.
The next hearing will take place on July 5.
