SINGAPORE - An elderly man was found dead in the kitchen of his rented HDB unit located at Block 117, Ho Ching Road yesterday afternoon.
According to The Straits Times, neighbours were alerted to the decomposing body of retiree Ong Geok Soon, 81, after investigating the source of a foul stench emitting from the flat.
At first, they thought it came from a rubbish chute, but after realising it was coming from a two-room unit on the 5th floor, they informed the Jurong Town Council at around 3pm.
When officers arrived at the scene, they reportedly looked through the window grilles and saw a body lying motionless.
They then alerted the police.
A neighbour, who only wanted to be identified as Madam Halizah, 40, said that the foul stench had been around since Saturday.
The deceased's nephews and nieces said that Mr Ong, who is a bachelor, had been living by himself for more than a decade.
The wife of one of his nephews, Madam Elizabeth Chua, 50, who works in sales and marketing, said she visited Mr Ong once a week.
She would usually visit him on Wednesday to give him his allowance and check up on him.
She told ST that she only knew about the death after a neighbour informed her at around 7pm. She immediately rushed down after that.
The police have ruled out foul play. Madam Chua said the family thinks that the deceased could have slipped and fallen in the kitchen.
Neighbours described Mr Ong as 'quiet', but said that he would sometimes chat with others at the void deck or visit a coffee shop across the road.
