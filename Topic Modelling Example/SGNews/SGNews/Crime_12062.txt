MALACCA: An Indonesian who came here last month to work as a rubber tapper was sentenced by the Sessions Court yesterday to 10 years' jail and five strokes of the rotan for armed gang robbery.
Jasmin, 47, pleaded guilty to breaking into the home of Mohd Shamir Fauzi, 28, at No 37, Pekan Pantai Belimbing in Durian Tunggal together with two others still at large about 4am on May 11 before committing the offence.
Jasmin was brought to court in a wheelchair as he was injured on his left thigh when he was shot by the home owner.
One of his two accomplices was shot in the stomach but he fled together with the third person.
Jasmin told the court that he had entered the country legally to work as a rubber tapper in Yong Peng, Johor, on April 30 and he had a wife and four children back home in Lombok, Indonesia.
"I followed my friends to Durian Tunggal. I was given a parang and was told that we were going to rob a house. I did not want to do it at first but changed my mind," he said.
Judge Zaharah Hussain told Jasmin that he actually had an option not to commit the offence as his intention in coming to Malaysia was to earn a living as a rubber tapper.
