A businessman in Singapore alleged that his female neighbour has been throwing rubbish and faeces at his doorstep, reported Sin Chew Daily.
The victim, known only as Lambert, claimed that the 70-year-old even brandished a knife when he confronted her.
"She has been treating my apartment as a dump for the past three months."
Lambert, 58, said initially, only papers and rubbish were thrown in the corridor.
He installed closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras outside his house to find the culprit. The recordings showed the woman in the act.
"She claimed that she was highly educated and denied committing the act when confronted."
Lambert said he called police but the woman refused to open the door.
