HONG KONG - Sex experts are urging Hong Kongers to strip off their reputation as some of the least-active lovers in Asia, to get more out of their sex lives and overcome challenges of privacy in a cramped city.
"People say Hong Kongers have the least amount of sexual knowledge in the world. One of the reasons is that they have no place to have sex," said Professor Emil Ng, associate director at the Family Institute of the University of Hong Kong.
Financial pressure, career-driven mentalities and limited space are seen as key drivers of a fertility rate that is one of the lowest in the world, with an average 1.04 births per woman, according to the World Bank.
Prof Ng, who believes monogamy in general is "behind the times", thinks another factor driving Hong Kong's sexual timidity is sky-high property prices.
Younger Hong Kong residents typically live at home deep into their 20s or 30s because they cannot afford to marry and move out earlier, meaning that many sleep in close proximity to their parents in cramped apartments.
He said: "Hong Kong is too crowded and lacks the privacy people need to have sex."
He organised the fifth Hong Kong Sex Cultural Festival which took place last month. The festival aimed to promote more liberal views on sex in the socially conservative southern Chinese city.
In a sign that traditional Chinese attitudes towards sex may be changing, a record number of visitors showed up at the recent 2012 China Adult-Care Expo in China's biggest city of Shanghai.
This year's expo - Asia's largest trade fair for the adult industry - was the biggest in the event's nine-year history, attracting thousands of visitors, said Hong Kong's South China Morning Post.
