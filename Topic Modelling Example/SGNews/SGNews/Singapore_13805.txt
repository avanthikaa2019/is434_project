Police have arrested a 35-year-old woman, suspected of robbery with hurt, yesterday afternoon.
The woman allegedly punched an 85-year-old man in the face before robbing him of about $900 on April 30. The suspect had befriended the man recently before the incident happened.
The victim was left bleeding at the apartment block along Eu Tong Sen Street. A resident chanced upon the victim and called for an ambulance and the police.
Officers from the Central Police Division mounted an operation and arrested the female suspect in Geylang on May 2.
The suspect will be charged for robbery with hurt tomorrow in court.
She will face up to 20 years jail.
Under the Penal Code, offenders will also receive up to 12 strokes of cane. However, as the suspect is a woman, she will be exempted under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
