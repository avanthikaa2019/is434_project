A 33-year-old man has been arrested for stealing a vehicle from a car-rental company in Eunos.
On April 1, staff of the rental company situated in Lorong Marzuki lodged a police report stating that a car parked outside their office was discovered missing a day earlier.
The vehicle was previously rented to the suspect, who was uncontactable after defaulting on rental payments.
He had also failed to return the vehicle but the rental company managed to locate it and tow it back.
A police spokesman said: "The suspect was elusive...as he did not reside at his registered address."
Officers' efforts finally paid off when they located the vehicle inside the compound of a private house along Upper Thomson Road last Thursday.
The suspect was traced and arrested at HarbourFront Ferry Terminal the following morning.
