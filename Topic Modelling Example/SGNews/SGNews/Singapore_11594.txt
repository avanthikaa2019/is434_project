The NTUC Foodfare social project, known as Rice Garden, is extending its services to the residents of Toa Payoh.
The Toa Payoh outlet will be called Warong Rice Garden, and is part of NTUC Foodfare Co-operative's larger plan to build more than 100 hawker centre stalls by 2015.
Like its pioneer outlet in Aljunied, Warong Rice Garden comes under a project aimed at providing meals for prices lower than those found at commercial outlets.
The general public can buy meals for as low as $2.50 while residents under the Public Assistance Scheme and concessionary card-holders are eligible to purchase meals for $1.99.
According to NTUC Foodfare, Rice Garden in Aljunied has served a total of 252,000 meals in the past three years, helping its concessionary customers save a total of $63,000 on food.
Warong Rice Garden is located at Blk 19, Toa Payoh Lorong 7 and operates from 7am to 8 pm daily.
