A family member of one of the Sukhoi Super Jet 100's passengers, Erwin Sofyan, 30, lamented the Russian airliner's decision to fly over Mt. Salak in Bogor, West Java, during its demonstration flight on Wednesday, which ended in tragedy.
"I am a Bogor resident. I know the Mt. Salak area pretty well. It's very difficult to evacuate victims if there are any airplane crashes in that area," he said at Post 1 in Bogor's Tenjolaya district in West Java on Thursday.
"Why should they fly over Mt. Salak? It is not a popular route to test an airplane - many airplanes have crashed in the area," he added.
Erwin's cousin, Erwin Kamil Jatnika, 43, an employee with PT Indo Asia, was one of the 45 people on board the ill-fated plane.
The airplane was declared missing after it lost contact with Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta at around 3 p.m. nearly an hour after take-off. It was found at 9:15 a.m. on Thursday on the slopes of Mt. Salak, at the height of 5,500 feet above sea level.
The airplane was on a "road show" in several Central and Southeast Asian countries to introduce the airplane by conducting demonstration flights.
Prior to the Sukhoi crash on Wednesday, three people died when their training aircraft crashed near Cibunar village, northwest of Mt. Salak.
The mountain was also the site of an Indonesian Air Force (TNI AU) crash in June 2008 that claimed 18 lives. Crashes near or on Mt. Salak also killed five in June 2004, two in April 2004, seven in October 2003, and one in October 2002, tempo.co reported.
Turbulence and unstable weather caused by the region's mountainous terrain contributed to the accidents.
