A student walked into a flooded open drain last June and drowned.
The 15-year-old Indonesian boy known as William was on holiday in Singapore when he fell into a drain at the junction of Mandalay Road and Minbu Road during a heavy downpour.
The drain was not visible because of brown, murky floodwater.
Investigations indicated that William tried holding on to the edge of the footway above the drain when he was swept into a drain pipe under Mandalay Road.
One of his two cousins accompanying him tried to prevent him from floating away by hooking his leg onto William's clothing, but the current was too strong.
His cries for help attracted another man from a nearby medical centre who ran out and soon pulled his cousin back to safety. But, they lost sight of William by then.
Residents in the area claimed that it was common for the drains to overflow during the heavy rains.
Though there are no railings where William fell, residents said that they have never heard of other similar incidents.
William's body was found at the Sungei Whampoa canal near Block 82 Whampoa Drive on the same evening.
The drainage system in Mandalay Road has since been upgraded earlier this year.
State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid said that the teen accidentally stepped into the flooded drain, was swept away and drowned.
