LONDON - British hope Andy Murray has been eased out to 12/1 with bookmaker Stan James to win his first Grand Slam at Wimbledon following a moderate run of results this year.
The 25-year-old Scot, ranked fourth in the world, has won just one title this season in Brisbane and reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open and the quarter-finals in Roland Garros.
Top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic will arrive at the All England club at 7/4 favourite to land a fifth straight Grand Slam tournament not played on clay.
Rafael Nadal edged out the Serb to secure a seventh French Open crown and is 5/2 to go one better than here 12 months ago, while Roger Federer is 11/2 to add to his six Wimbledon victories and join Pete Sampras at the top of the all-time leaderboard.
&ldquo;Another Nadal-versus-Djokovic decider would be nice and we are 6/4 that occurs,&rdquo; said Rupert Adams of William Hill.
Maria Sharapova last won at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old back in 2004 but the Russian is 11/4 to follow up her recent triumph at Roland Garros.
Serena Williams is 3/1 to hold the trophy at the All England Club for the fifth time, while defending champion Petra Kvitova is 13/2 at best to retain her title after seeing off Sharapova in last year's final.
&ldquo;Sharapova won the French Open and it is a case of trying to catch the Russian now,&rdquo; Adams added. &ldquo;Everyone else seems to be out of form and we expect her price to shorten.&rdquo;
