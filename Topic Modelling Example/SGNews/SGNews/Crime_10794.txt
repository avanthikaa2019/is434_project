BUKIT MERTAJAM - An engineer was pistol-whipped by two robbers who escaped with his luxury Mercedes-Benz car at his house at Taman Desa Damai here.
The 29-year-old engineer had just parked his Mercedes sports coupe at his porch at 5am yesterday when the two robbers, one armed with a pistol, came and forced him out of the car. The victim was also pistol-whipped on his forehead.
The robbers then escaped with the car after firing a warning shot in the air.
Central Seberang Prai Deputy OCPD Supt Baharudin Mustafa said the victim was in a stable condition.
He said a forensic team found a bullet casing at the scene.
In Kota Bahru, two men, aged 28 and 25, were detained after a car was reported stolen.
Kelantan police chief Datuk Jalaluddin Abdul Rahman said that the incident occurred at 5.45am on Saturday when the police saw the victim's car travelling near Kampung Pendek at Jalan Salor Lama.
"The police team ordered the three men in the car to stop, but they refused to obey. The driver then tried to hit the police team's car. The officers had to open fire and the victim's car came to a halt when a bullet hit its engine," he added.
