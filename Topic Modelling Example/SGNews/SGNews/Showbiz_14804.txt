Jill (Amanda Seyfried) has never been the same ever since she escaped from a serial killer who left her at the bottom of a hole in the woods.
She now lives with her sister, Molly (Emily Wickersham), and is slowly trying to get her life together again.
When Molly disappears, Jill is convinced that the killer is back, and she has to track down her sister before it is too late.
In Gone, Seyfried's big eyes are used to good effect to convey fear and frustration. Too bad the plot never really goes anywhere.
