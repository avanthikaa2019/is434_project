More than 252,000 $1.99 meals have been sold since the pilot Rice Garden outlet in Aljunied in 2009.
The response has been positive. Over the last three years, concession card holders have collectively enjoyed $63,000 in meal savings, says a spokesman for the co-operative.
Its latest stall, Warong Rice Garden at Toa Payoh, which opened earlier this year and made headlines here, is also proving to be a hit with diners, says its spokesman.
Since the soon-to-be-halal certified stall opened on May 1, it has sold 5,000 plates of nasi lemak.
One patron at the Toa Payoh stall, Mr Hamid Ibrahim, 60, says: "The meals are cheap and the portions are decent... That's what people want to see when they are looking for food, I think."
Social enterprise NTUC Foodfare Co-operative also aims to have a network of 100 stalls islandwide by 2015.
It runs 45 foodcourts, coffee shops, food kiosks, cafes and a catering service.
It was also recently picked to manage a new food centre being planned in Bukit Panjang.
Construction work for the Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre is expected to begin in mid-2013 and be completed by end-2014. A spokesman declined to say if the $1.99 meals would feature there.
