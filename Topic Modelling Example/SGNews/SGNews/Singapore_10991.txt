Something new is brewing at Tiger Beer in Tuas. The brewery tour has an addition in the form of a beer bottle.
The tour, which was launched on June 4 at the Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore (APBS) is called New Tiger Brewery Tour. This is a behind-the-scenes showcase of the efforts that contribute to the brewing of Tiger Beer.
Part of the tour will be a new Packaging Gallery, an exhibition hall created in the structure of an 18m-long Tiger Beer bottle.
In addition to the Packaging Gallery, which will give visitors an experience of the packaging process and immerse them in the beer's heritage, the tour will shed light on the best brewing practices adopted by APBS.
The tour costs $16 per person and is available Monday to Friday. At the end of the tour, visitors get to taste the different kinds of beer produced by the brewery.
Said APBS general manager Michael Chin: "The New Tiger Brewery Tour will serve a vital role for APBS to put the spotlight on the Tiger brewery as a destination and to celebrate the great beer that we brew.
"With Tiger Beer loved worldwide by millions of people and established as an integral part of Singapore's identity, the new tour presents the ideal opportunity for one and all to discover the story behind it."
