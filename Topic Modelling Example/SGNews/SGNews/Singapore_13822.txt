SINGAPORE - Preserving common spaces of historical value, such as the Rail Corridor that reopened in January, is important, said President Tony Tan Keng Yam yesterday.
"(The Rail Corridor) is an asset... There are very deep historical connections at various parts of the corridor. We should preserve as much of it as possible, while not leaving it a 'white elephant'," he said.
The President was speaking on the sidelines of a visit to the Journey of Possibilities exhibition at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Centre, where he was hosted by Minister of State for National Development Tan Chuan-Jin.
The exhibition showcased ideas for the future of the Rail Corridor suggested by the public, in response to five challenges identified by URA.
They were submitted as entries in the Ideas competition which URA started in November last year.
The competition drew more than 200 submissions, from Singapore and overseas participants.
One winning idea involves a food cooperative to link farmers and residents in the northern part of the Rail Corridor in Kranji.
The idea also includes the redevelopment of abandoned army barracks for urban-farming research.
It was conceived by a group of nine people who affectionately call themselves the Kranji Kakis.
Building consultant David Gould, 60, who is a member of Kranji Kakis, said: "We want to transform that part of the Rail Corridor from a dead end to a life-giving network."
