BIRMINGHAM, England - Blackpool will play West Ham in the Championship play-off final later this month after they edged Birmingham City 3-2 on aggregate after their play-off second leg match finished 2-2 here Wednesday.
It will mean an immediate return to the Premier League for the winners of the play-off final as they along with Birmingham were relegated last season.
Blackpool - who started their maiden Premier League campaign in great style but then their form dipped alarmingly leading to relegation - looked to be in firm control after taking a 2-0 lead at their hosts.
Goals by Stephen Dobbie and Matt Phillips eased them into a comfortable lead only for City, who have been ably managed by Chris Hughton since he stepped in after Alex McLeish left last summer, fought back.
Giant Serbian striker Nikola Zigic and Curtis Davies replied to level the match on the night but the 'Tangerines' held on to enjoy the fruits of their earlier labours.
