SEATTLE - Starbucks opened the first store in its new Evolution Fresh juice-bar chain yesterday, its biggest move outside coffee aimed at boosting the company's position in the US$50-billion (S$63-billion) health-food sector.
But the juice-bar business is fragmented and intensely competitive. Some analysts said that the shops could have lower margins than Starbucks' coffee shops.
With Starbucks yet to detail how many juice bars it plans to open, the popularity of its first shop, located in an upscale shopping area in Bellevue, Washington, will be closely watched.
"Mixologists" at the juice bar dispense a variety of juices - including apple, coconut water, carrot and beetroot - from taps to create handcrafted concoctions with names like "sweet burn" and "field of greens".
The 230g drinks sell for US$4.99.
The juice bar also sells bottled Evolution Fresh fruitand-vegetable juices, smoothies and food such as oatmeal, wraps, salads and soup. The menu includes vegan and vegetarian options. So-called super-foods like kale and quinoa are well represented.
Starbucks ranks among the United States' best companies at marketing, with Americans willing to spend money on healthy beverages.
Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore noted that despite the scepticism over Starbucks entering the business, some of its recent roll-outs - particularly its Via instant coffee and K-cups coffee refills for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters' popular Keurig one-cup brewers - have exceeded analysts' expectations.
"The lesson here is not to underestimate Starbucks' ability to execute a concept very, very well," she said.
Starbucks' purchase of Evolution Fresh for US$30 million last year was in line with its strategy to sell a broader range of products through its own cafes, grocery stores and other retail outlets.
