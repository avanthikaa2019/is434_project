SINGAPORE - After Singapore's less than desirable Queen Sirikit Cup campaign, plans are already in place to better prepare the players for future tournaments.
Said the Singapore team captain Marvane E (right): "The Queen Sirikit Cup was good exposure for our girls. They just need to do what they did during their practice rounds on the actual day.
"We intend to start a new high performance training programme for the national team to ensure that the players gain more exposure."
New additions will include consultations with the sports psychologist to improve the mental game of the girls.
It is understood that the world No. 1 amateur Lydia Ko and top South Korean amateur Kim Hyo Joo visit their sports psychologist on a regular basis.
Said E: "Our players can hit just as well as the other girls, but golf is a mind game and they need to improve on that area."
Added Singapore coach Brad McManus: "The expectations of the local supporters and media might be too overwhelming for the girls. We will need to address the whole situation on how they can improve their games."
At the Tanah Merah Country Club last Friday, the trio of Koh Sock Hwee, 22, Amelia Yong, 20, and Fariza Izanie Zain, 20, finished last out of 13 teams with a combined score of 476.
Hosting the tournament for the first time since 1983, they were hoping for a decent showing, but it did not turn out that way.
Said Koh, who was playing in her fourth Queen Sirikit Cup: "The team are disappointed. We were expecting much more from ourselves.
"We struggled in the last three days. Our inexperience showed in our mental game. I was unable to hit consistently and had fewer birdie opportunities."
