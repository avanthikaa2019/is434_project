CARACAS - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez promised Tuesday an "unprecedented" victory in the upcoming presidential election in his first appearance since returning from his latest trip to Cuba for cancer treatment.
"The defeat we will give you has no precedent in the political history of this country," Chavez said, addressing his opposition.
Chavez, 57, spoke at a council of ministers in a two-hour-plus event broadcast on radio and television.
The president, who returned from Havana on May 11, did not offer details about his condition.
Chavez has had phone conversations that aired on state-run VTV television since returning from Cuba, but this was the first time he appeared on camera since the trip.
Chavez has undergone surgery twice in the past year to remove cancerous tumors, and has had chemotherapy followed by radiation treatments to try to rid himself of the cancer.
He has not disclosed the type of cancer he has or the prognosis, which, with presidential elections set for October 7, has fueled political uncertainty and a wave of rumors.
In power since 1999, Chavez is running for a third consecutive term as a "revolutionary socialist" against Henrique Capriles, the youthful Miranda state governor and center-left candidate for the united opposition.
