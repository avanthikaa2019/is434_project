MONTREAL - Canada said Monday that it was working on the documents needed to secure the extradition of a murder suspect dubbed the "Canadian Psycho," arrested in Germany on suspicion of dismembering his lover.
Police in Berlin picked up Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, at an Internet cafe after a days-long hunt for the man believed to have murdered his Chinese lover with an ice pick, dismembered his body and filmed the grisly killing.
"Mr. Magnotta has been arrested in Berlin, Germany on an Interpol Red notice which under German law constitutes a provisional request from Canada for his extradition," justice ministry spokeswoman Julie Di Mambro said in a statement.
"Pursuant to the Canada-Germany Treaty on extradition, Canada has to now submit a formal request for his extradition accompanied by documentation outlining the evidence supporting the request," she said.
The spokeswoman said officials were working "to prepare the materials in support of the request," adding that Magnotta was expected to appear in a Berlin court on Tuesday.
"Canada will continue to be advised of the progress of this matter through the German courts," she said.
Interpol had issued a Red Notice wanted-persons alert for Magnotta, also known as Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov, to its 190 member countries after a video of the grisly killing surfaced online.
The murder came to light when Canadian police said last week that a human foot had been sent to the headquarters of Canada's ruling Conservative Party.
A hand was later found in the mail at an Ottawa post office, and a torso was discovered in Montreal. Canadian police believe the remains belong to a Chinese man who was dating Magnotta - and that Magnotta is to blame.
