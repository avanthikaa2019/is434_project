PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - The barrel of laughs will continue for two days running now that world renowned stand-up comedian Russell Peters has announced a second show here in Malaysia at 8.30pm on May 11 at Stadium Melawati, a day before his originally confirmed show on May 12 at the same venue.
The May 12 show saw 7,900 tickets sold out within three hours after they went on sale.
Peters has regularly set attendance records wherever he's travelled to share his brand of humour, which makes fun of racial, ethnic, class and cultural issues.
In 2009, he sold out London's O2 Arena, drawing 16,000 fans.
His greatest feat so far though, is selling out two shows in Dubai in eight minutes last month faster than pop diva Madonna's concert there.
The Canadian comedian of Indian ethnicity, who gained prominence on video sharing site YouTube, will be performing in Singapore before making his way to Malaysia.
According to the Malaysian show producer, Running Into the Sun (RITS) together with LOL Events, Malaysian fans had started queuing up in front of their office in Kelana Jaya for the tickets at 6.30am, before ticket sales even begun at 9am for the May 12 show.
The Star Media Group is the official media partner and Red FM, managed by The Star, is the official radio station for the Russell Peters' Notorious 2012 World Tour.
Tickets for the May 11 show go on sale from 10am on Saturday and are available from redtix.airasia.com and ticketpro.com.my
