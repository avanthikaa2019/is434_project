The success of Singapore's technical institutions, which has altered the country's perception of technical education, has caught the attention of the Sultanate.
Education Minister Yang Berhormat Pehin Orang Kaya Seri Kerna Dato Seri Setia Hj Abu Bakar Hj Apong said this to Singapore Prime Minister His Excellency Lee Hsien Loong, who is also the patron for the Lee Kuan Yew Exchange Fellowship (LKYEF), at a meeting that took place at Singapore Palace.
A press release from the Ministry of Education (MOE) said that in attending LKYEF as a special guest, the minister was better able to understand the accomplishments of the Singaporean education system.
It also said that the minister paid particular attention to the development and progress of a few technical education institutes that have contributed to the improved image of Singaporean technical education.
He said that the bilateral relations between both countries' Education Ministries have blossomed over the years and expressed a deep appreciation for collaborative programmes such as the Joint Working Group and School twinning programme, in which the exchange of students, teachers and professionals has produced high quality educators.
