This is a movie that will appeal only to die-hard fans of Taiwanese idol dramas.
Other than the casting of idol-drama regulars Ella Chen and Mike Ho, the film is filled with cutesy photo montages and corny dialogue that will have young idol-drama buffs squealing and swooning.
The story follows Chen - once again, in a sweet-tomboy role reminiscent of her parts in series such as Hanazakarino Kimitachihe (2006) and Down With Love (2010) - as she goes about her life goal of aggressively beating down male bullies.
