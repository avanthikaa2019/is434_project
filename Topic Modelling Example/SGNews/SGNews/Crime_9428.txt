INDIA - A 12-day-old baby girl was poisoned to death, allegedly by her parents, in a remote tribal village in Bollapalli.
Makkal Osai reported that the infant was born to Bhukya Baba Naik and Chilka Bai in the village about 150km from Hyderabad in South India.
The couple had decided to get rid of the infant as they already have three daughters.
They told villagers that the child had died of a severe fever but villagers recalled how Baba Naik's third daughter had died in a similar manner two years ago.
When they confronted the couple, Chilka Bai admitted to feeding pesticide to the baby, claiming she mistook it for syrup.
Baba Naik fled the village and police have launched a manhunt.
