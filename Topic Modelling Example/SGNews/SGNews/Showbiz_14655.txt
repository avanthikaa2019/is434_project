PETALING JAYA - Fans of former Bond girl Datuk Michelle Yeoh will not only get to meet the star, but also watch a movie with her on April 25.
Yeoh will attend a special charity premiere of her latest film The Lady, an event organised by the Malaysian Chinese Women Entrepeneur Association (MCWE) in collaboration with the Malaysian Chinese Women Leader Caucus, TGV Cinemas and Sunway Pyramid.
The funds raised will be used to conduct skills development and career building courses for underprivileged women, including single mothers and women from the lower income group.
Deputy Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Heng Seai Kie, said: "Datuk Michelle Yeoh should be a role model for women in Malaysia to emulate because she epitomises independence, intelligence, beauty and shows how women can be a force in the society."
The Lady was directed by acclaimed French director Luc Benson, famous for his works Taxi and The Fifth Element.
In The Lady, Yeoh portrays Aung San Suu Kyi in the freedom fighter's struggle for a more democratic country.
"Suu Kyi's spirit in putting the people and her country first despite hardship is truly an inspiration for all," Heng said yesterday.
TGV Cinemas will hold the movie premiere in four of its halls.
Tickets are priced at RM100(S$40) each in three of the halls, while those planning to be in the same hall as Yeoh have to pay RM1,000 per ticket.
