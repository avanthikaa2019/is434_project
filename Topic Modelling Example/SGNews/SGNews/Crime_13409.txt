A 31-year-old manager who allegedly paid for sex with an underage girl on two occasions was in court yesterday, for a second time.
Chiang Meng Chuan - who was among 48 men hauled to court last month - had been charged with having commercial sex with the minor at Hotel 81 Bencoolen on Sept 23 and 29, 2010.
The prosecution yesterday tendered two amended charges which named the girl. She cannot be named here due to a gag order.
Chiang, who is represented by lawyer Alan Shankar, is due to appear in court again on June 11 - along with the other men who have been charged.
So far, only one of the accused has been convicted of having sex with the girl, whom they are said to have paid between $450 and $850 per session.
Former Pei Chun Public School principal Lee Lip Hong, 39, was sentenced to nine weeks' jail last month after pleading guilty to having paid sex with the minor at a budget hotel in September 2010.
A second charge of having sex with her in December that year was taken into consideration.
The men charged so far are believed to have sought the services of the Singaporean teenager through an online vice ring.
Their sessions, allegedly between September 2010 and February last year, took place in hotels ranging from budget hotels to premium establishments.
If convicted, the men could face imprisonment of up to seven years, a fine or both.
