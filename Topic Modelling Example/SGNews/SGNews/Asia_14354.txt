SEOUL - A South Korean who apparently lost money during more than 100 visits to a casino over the past year has killed himself there, leaving a note expressing hatred for the place, police said Wednesday.
The 50-year-old man surnamed Seo was found hanging from a electrical cord in a hotel room at the Kangwon Land casino in the eastern province of Gangwon, a police official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Seo made more than 100 visits over the past year, he said, adding a note reading, "I hate Kangwon Land" had been found in his room.
"Apparently he killed himself after losing money there," said the official. Among 17 casinos operating in the nation, only Kangwon Land is open to South Korean nationals as part of an attempt to control gambling. Foreigners must show passports to gamble elsewhere.
