Scarlett Johansson was honoured with the 2,470th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday. Said the 27-year-old actress: "This industry in which I was practically raised has been so impossibly kind to me.
"There's never a day where I go to set and don't thank my lucky stars to simply be a working actor."
Johansson was accompanied by The Avengers co-star Jeremy Renner, who joked that working with her on the blockbuster was "tremendous...ly awful".
He deadpanned: "For six months, she continuously threw me around, beat me, stepped on me and wiped the floor with my dignity and self-respect every day - all with a smile on her face."
