SINGAPORE - An unemployed Singaporean was today sentenced to 4 1/2 years' jail for committing 151 offences including cheating 106 people in a Hari Raya rental scam.
In August 2011, at least 90 victims responded to an advertisement in the newspapers that offered cars for rental at a discounted price for Hari Raya.
The victims paid deposits of between $200 to $688 depending on the model of the cars they intended to rent and the period of rental.
The scam unfolded when the victims arrived at the car rental office located along Beach Road to collect the rental vehicles and found it closed.
The prosecution told the court that Ngiu, 39, had run off with a total of $37,500, reported The Straits Times.
While the office was closed the lease of the premises was in Ngiu's name and he was soon arrested by police.
In April and May of 2011, Ngui had also cheated 18 pawnshops with fake Rolex watches. Using the fakes he had obtained from Malaysia, he fooled the pawnshops of $3,500 to $6,000 for each watch.
Two months later, investigations show that Ngui stole residents' credit cards from their letter-boxes and used the cards to buy jewellery amounting to nearly $28,000.
His total loot amounted to about $155,000.
