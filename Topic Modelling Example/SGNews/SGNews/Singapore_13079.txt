The Ministry of Defense (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) presented 125 awards to servicemen and staff for their outstanding and innovative contributions.
The awards were handed out during the MINDEF PRIDE (PRoductivity and Innovation in Daily Efforts) Day, which was held on Friday.
Over 111,000 suggestions and 5,000 WITS projects were submmited last year.
Those that were implemented helped MINDEF and SAF to save $163.6 million in the last financial year, an increase of 20 per cent from 2010.
Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen shared at the award ceremony that despite the required discipline and mission orientedness, he hopes for MINDEF and SAF to be a place where "people are encouraged to contribute ideas that can make a difference". This is aim of this year's theme "iMatter. iCan. iWill."
The MINDEF PRIDE Movement first started in 1981 to promote a culture of innovation and productivity. The PRIDE Day has been held annually to recognise outstanding contributions.
The public can view winning projects at the MINDEF PRIDE Day 2012 Exhibition from May 26 to 27.
