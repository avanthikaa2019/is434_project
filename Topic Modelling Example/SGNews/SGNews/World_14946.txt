LONDON - Maintenance workers on the London Underground train network will strike for 72 hours next week, the RMT union announced Tuesday.
The Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which represents around 1,000 such workers on the Tube, said its members will walk out at 4:00pm (1500 GMT) Tuesday until 4:00pm Friday.
The strike comes two weeks before the London mayoral election and 100 days ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Transport chiefs are anxious to deliver a strike-free Games.
The dispute is over rights to pension schemes and travel concession perks.
RMT general secretary Bob Crow accused Tube Lines, responsible for maintaining the Underground, of taking a "pig-headed approach".
"This dispute is about justice and about ensuring that all groups of staff under the umbrella of London Underground receive the same rights and benefits," he said.
Tube Lines operations director Lee Jones said: "A strike on this issue is completely unnecessary and will not achieve anything.
"Should a strike go ahead, we have plans in place which will enable London Underground to operate Tube services... and to minimise any disruption."
During the Olympics, the network will have to deal with an extra three million daily journeys, as 10,500 athletes, 9,000 officials, 20,000 journalists and millions of spectators head to Olympic sites across the capital.
