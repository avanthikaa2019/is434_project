Some 6,000 soldiers were deployed to guard 400 schools of the three southernmost provinces during the school term opening Wednesday, Army Chief Gen Prayuth Chanocha said.
However there were two problems; that the teacher and student protection was a receptive measure in the face of insurgents' ability to launch attack anytime; and that some people preferred to defend themselves and stay away from officials especially teachers because they were insurgents' targets, Prayuth said affirming the soldiers would try their best to provide security and urged teachers not to travel alone out of the guarded route.
