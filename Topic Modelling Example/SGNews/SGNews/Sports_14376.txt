SINGAPORE - Former national shuttler Ronald Susilo and his wife, Widyana Mulia, welcomed their newborn yesterday morning, reported The Straits Times (ST).
The baby weighed 2.7kg and was born through natural delivery at Thomson Medical Centre after about 16 hours in labour.
The couple named their first born Rafael Edward - and no, it is not after tennis great, Rafael Nadal.
Susilo, who witnessed the birth of his son, told ST: "We went for pre-natal classes, but I've forgotten most of what we learnt.
Both 32 years old, the couple of Indonesian heritage got married last year after dating for more than a year.
They told ST that they will live in Singapore to raise Rafael and the excited father said he will give his son badminton lessons when he grows up.
Susilo, who was named 2005 Sportsman of the Year, now runs his own badminton academy and doubles up as a financial adviser with Great Eastern. His wife works as an audit manager.
