China'S Huo Jianqi had previously directed the well-received drama Postmen In The Mountains (2002). Unfortunately, it turns out that he has no feel for romance at all.
In this film, do-gooder Hsiao-mo (Chen Bo- lin's charm is wasted here) is paired with a bland singer-on-the-run, May (Zhang Ziyi look-alike Tong Yao).
Too much time is spent on her story and none of it is urgent or interesting.
Meanwhile, there is a not-quite-romance between Hsiao-mo and May as she pines for a music producer who spouts lines such as "Rain is the poetry of the world".
But, just as Cape No. 7 (2008) boosted Hengchun's tourism, Snowfall In Taipei makes you feel like making a trip to Chingtung old town the next time you are in Taiwan.
SNOWFALL IN TAIPEI (PG) Romance-drama/105 minutes Rating: 1.5/5 stars
