The Metropolitan Police Department has arrested 12 Japanese and Filipinas in Tokyo over fake marriages, the MPD said.
The MPD on Tuesday arrested Isao Tanaka, the 45-year-old owner of a bar in Sumida Ward, Tokyo, and another man on suspicion of violating the Adult Entertainment Businesses Law.
Five Filipino women working at the bar and five Japanese men were also arrested the same day on suspicion of making false entries into electromagnetic public documents to be used as originals for notarized deeds.
They were also suspected of using the allegedly falsified documents.
