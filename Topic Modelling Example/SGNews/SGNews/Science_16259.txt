SAN FRANCISCO - Apple chief Tim Cook has won over the company's employees, according to a workplace study released on Friday showing he may be better liked than his legendary predecessor Steve Jobs.
Cook topped a Glassdoor.com ranking of corporate chief executives with a 97 per cent approval rating by those he commands at the California-based maker of iPads, iPhones, iPods and Macintosh computers.
In comparison, Jobs had a 95 per cent approval rating in the Glassdoor ranking in March of last year.
Jobs's cumulative approval rating was 97 per cent when he ceded the Apple helm to Cook in August of last year due to a battle with cancer, which took his life two months later.
"While many speculated how Cook would be received by employees and how he would lead the tech giant, he seems to have settled in quite nicely," Glassdoor said in its report.
The heads of chip maker Qualcomm and consultancy Ernst &amp; Young were close behind Cook with approval ratings of 95 per cent each.
The list of the top five most popular chief executives was rounded out by American Express boss Ken Chenault and Google co-founder Larry Page, who were each given 94 per cent approval ratings.
