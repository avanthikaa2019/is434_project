Sixteen women have been duped into parting with their money and jewellery to a man who befriended them over social networking and matrimonial sites, Makkal Osai reported.
The women allegedly conned by Chakravathy @ M Tamilselvan, 27, were well-educated and held jobs in fields such as Information Technology, education and medicine.
Most of them were from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Puducherry in India, while others were from Dubai and Mauritius.
Chakravathy and his alleged partner-in-crime R. Perumal, 50, were charged in a Madurai court with cheating the women of several thousands of rupees by promising to marry them.
"Chakaravarthy introduced himself as a rich person who held a high position in a company and that his parents were doctors with a chain of clinics," said Madurai deputy inspector-general of police B. Balanagadevi.
"Within a short time, he developed intimacy with the girls," Balanagadevi said, adding that the accused also took semi-nude images of some of the victims.
"He would later persuade the girls to deposit money into a certain bank account and also collected jewellery from them before abruptly ending the relationship."
