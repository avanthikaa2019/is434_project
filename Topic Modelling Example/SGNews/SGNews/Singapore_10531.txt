Call-centre representatives of banks and telcos do not have the knowledge to answer inquiries or provide accurate or relevant information to callers, a survey suggests.
The survey was conducted last December by the Consumers Association of Singapore, in collaboration with students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Business &amp; Accountancy.
It revealed that, on average, only 8.4 per cent of respondents agreed that call-centre representatives were able to answer their inquiries during initial contact.
In the survey, a total of 1,403 responses were collected from 1,004 respondents.
It also revealed that, on average, more than 70 per cent of respondents agreed that call-centre representatives did not have the knowledge to answer inquiries, or to provide accurate or relevant information.
