SHAH ALAM, Malaysia - A convicted rapist serving 50 years in jail made a strange request yesterday after he pleaded guilty to another charge.
G. Thiyagaran, 35, asked Sessions judge Mohammed Mokhzani Mokhtar for the maximum sentence for raping a 19-year-old student three years ago.
Mokhzani asked if the accused knew what he meant by maximum, to which Thiyagaran replied: "Give me a long jail term. I don't care. I cannot be forgiven. I admit I did it."
The judge then sentenced Thiyagaran to 20 years' jail and 10 strokes of the rotan for raping the girl, who was then in Form 6, at the Kerling Chinese cemetery in Hulu Selangor at 7am on Oct 8, 2009.
He initially claimed trial to the offence but changed his plea after 11 witnesses testified.
Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Che Rohana Ismail had pressed for a deterrent sentence due to the gravity of the offence.
She said the accused had destroyed the victim's future and left her traumatised.
"She now has to live in shame and the stigma of being a rape victim."
"The accused also has two previous convictions for rape."
In 2010, Thiyagaran was sentenced by the Sessions Court in Ipoh to 50 years' jail and 20 strokes of the rotan for two counts of rape.
Mokhzani ordered Thiyagaran to begin serving his 20 years' jail sentence after the expiry of the 50 year term.
Thiyagaran will only finish serving that sentence in 2041, after remission for good behaviour.
According to the victim's evidence, she was waiting for a bus to go to school when the accused approached her, threatened her and pushed her into his car.
He then drove to the cemetery and raped her.
