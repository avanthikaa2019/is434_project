BRISBANE, Australia - A man reported to be the great-grandson of Scout movement founder Robert Baden-Powell appeared in a Brisbane court Thursday charged with murdering his wife.
Gerard Baden-Clay, 41, is accused of killing his wife Allison and interfering with her corpse, which was found in a Brisbane creek 10 days after he reported her missing to police in April.
He was charged on Wednesday, following a two-month investigation which saw searchers scour massive tracts of land near the family home where the couple lived with their three daughters.
Police have not issued further details over the interference charges.
The couple met while working at travel company Flight Centre, where Allison Baden-Clay, 43, went on to become the global head of human resources, according to local media.
Her husband, now a real estate agent, was widely reported to be the great-grandson of British Lord Baden-Powell, an army lieutenant-general who founded the global Scout movement in 1907.
Baden-Clay agreed in court Thursday to provide police with a DNA sample and his lawyers said they would make an application for bail, adding that he maintained his innocence and would vigorously defend the case.
