Attention all Singapore dog owners and Dog Whisperer fans!
Those who want to meet Cesar Millan, the star of hit reality TV series Dog Whisperer, and have him personally help with their pet dog's behavioural issues will have the chance to make their wish come true.
Mexican-born Millan, 42, will make his first-ever stop in Singapore as part of the Cesar Millan Live tour to be held at Marina Bay Sands Grand Theater on June 2 and 3.
National Geographic Channel has announced that the search is now on to select one owner and his/her pooch to earn a visit from the popular dog behavioural therapist at their home on June 4.
Interested parties need to submit a video lasting at least three minutes that captures their pet's problematic behaviour to the National Geographic Facebook page.
The clips will be subject to review by Millan, who will select one lucky pooch out of the litter.
