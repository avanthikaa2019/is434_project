SINGAPORE - The police said that they are searching for the man who was spotted stealing money from the accident scene of the horror Ferrari crash that killed three people.
Eye-witnesses said that they saw a man who looked to be in his 30s picking up notes and coins scattered around the mangled taxi while the Japanese victim lay dying in the vehicle.
57-year-old Mr Lim, a cleaner from Malaysia, told Lianhe Wanbao that the woman, who was later identified as Shigemi Ito, was crying out in pain while the man pocketed the money and ran off.
The suspect is believed to have been dressed in a T-shirt and shorts.
Reports said the man pocketed about $300 in all. Mr Lim was not able to react in time to stop the man, the report said.
Footage from the Land Transport Authority's surveillance cameras has been viewed and seized for the investigation, The Straits Times reported.
Miss Ito was later brought to the Singapore General Hospital where she died.
Mr Ma Chi, 31, who was driving the Ferrari, died at the scene while the taxi driver Cheng Teck Hock, 52, also died later at the hospital.
