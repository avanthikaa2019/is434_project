WASHINGTON - A suspect accused of attempting to assassinate United States (US) President Barack Obama last year pleaded not guilty to two extra charges on Friday and waived his right to a speedy trial.
Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, who is said to have opened fire on the White House when Mr Obama was not in residence, has now been charged with 19 counts, including that he did 'knowingly attempt to kill the president of the United States'.
Two new charges were laid against him on Friday, including 'injury to a dwelling and placing lives in jeopardy within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States'.
The second new charge was 'using, carrying, brandishing and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence', as concerned the property damage and the threat to people on government property.
