WELLINGTON - New Zealand police said Tuesday they were mystified by a spate of hair care packages sent from Paris to residents of the South Island's remote west coast.
Four packages mailed from Paris have arrived in the region over the past week, each containing a hairdryer or hair clippers, and cash ranging from NZ$100 ($78) in New Zealand money to 100 euros (S$135) in euro notes, police said.
They said the recipients of the parcels, which reportedly contained notes saying "thanks for being a good/true friend", had no idea who sent them or why.
"At this stage police have not made any criminal connection with the parcels and they appear to simply be a goodwill gesture. However, they would like to hear from anyone else who has received a parcel," a police statement said.
