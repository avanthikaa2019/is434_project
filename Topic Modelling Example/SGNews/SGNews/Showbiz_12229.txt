SEOUL - Members of the K-pop boy band 2PM and girl group miss A will participate in a tour program designed to promote Korean culture to foreign K-pop fans in June, Korea Tourism Organization said on Tuesday.
Serving as goodwill ambassadors to the state-run travel agency, members of the two groups will accompany groups of foreign fans of K-pop selected through a video contest in May. The odds of getting selected were 310-to-1, KTO said.
The program will invite seven winners of the contest and eight candidates selected by KTO's offices overseas to attend the travel program, "Touch Korea Tour," from June 7-27.
During the week-long schedule, three of the days will see the foreign fans joined by three K-pop stars.
The stars are expected to help the visitors learn more about Korean culture and create memorable experiences for them.
Junsu and Wooyoung from 2PM and Min from miss A will join the fun tour that features adventures on Jeju Island and in PyeongChang, the host city of the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Miss A's Suzy and 2PM's Chansung and Junho will participate in the gourmet tour of culinary pleasures in Jeonju, Damyang, Suncheon and Yeosu.
Fei and Jia from miss A and Taecyeon from 2PM will also help participants explore different shopping experiences in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Busan and Seoul.
