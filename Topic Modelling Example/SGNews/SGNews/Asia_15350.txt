BHUBANESWAR - Indian Maoist rebels on Thursday released an Italian tour guide kidnapped nearly one month ago in the eastern state of Orissa, police said.
"I have information from the local police that Paolo (Bosusco) has been released. He is yet to arrive out of the forest," senior police official R. K. Sharma told AFP.
Bosusco was kidnapped on March 14 along with another Italian man, Claudio Colangelo, who was released 11 days later.
Bosusco, who runs an adventure holiday company based in Orissa, and Colangelo, a doctor from Rome, were abducted by the rebels while trekking in the remote district of Kandhamal.
The kidnapping was the first time the Maoists, who say they are fighting for the rights of India's tribal people and landless farmers, have targeted foreigners.
Orissa state assembly lawmaker Jhina Hikaka remains in captivity with a separate group of Maoists after being taken hostage on March 24.
The chief minister of Orissa agreed to free 27 prisoners during negotiations with the rebels, who control large parts of central and eastern India.
