Weapons (Sony)
It's more of the same from this Welsh alternative-rock outfit on their fifth album, which isn't necessarily a good thing.
There are some hooks, but a lack of experimentation means many songs, like Jesus Walks and A Song For Where I'm From, sound more than a tad dated.
Still, the band - frontman Ian Watkins, in particular - sound convinced, so who are we to argue?
