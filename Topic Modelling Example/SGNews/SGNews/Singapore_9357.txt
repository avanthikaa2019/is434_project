Service staff in the food-andbeverage industry can look forward to a possible pay rise if they complete a new training course.
The Workforce Development Agency (WDA) yesterday launched a new Workforce Skills Qualifications Diploma in Food and Beverage Service for such workers.
The diploma includes a mentorship programme for aspiring service professionals, to learn from service-industry experts from restaurants such as Imperial Treasure and Les Amis.
The course will be conducted by At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy, a WDA National Continuing Education and Training institute.
The academy's chief executive, Mr Christophe Megel, said that, from his experience, service staff who have been "formally trained" may receive, on average, "a 5 per cent to 10 per cent increase in wages".
