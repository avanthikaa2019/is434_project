DMC-GF5 is the fifth iteration of Panasonic's mirrorless digital camera, and it appears that such cameras are headed towards the size and weight of higher-end compact digitals while retaining the functionalities of SLR-like cameras.
The GF5 is a 12.1-megapixel camera with an ISO rating of up to 12800. The touchscreen display offers a pinch-and-zoom feature, and a good number of camera functions.
It is very user-friendly and versatile, and has probably one of the best touchscreen interfaces around.
The camera's shutter clicks with authority and everything seems to be in the right place.
Overall assessment of the GF5 is that it is a light and easy-to-use camera that should match the needs of those who seek an SLR-like camera, minus the weight and relative bulk.
How much: $1,099 for each kit.
Two kits available - GF5X with power-zoom 14-42mm lens, and GF5W with 14mm pancake lens and 14-42mm standard-kit lens.
Promotion lasts until July 1.
