LONDON - A horse-drawn carriage will carry the coffin of Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb to a church in his home town of Thame, central England, later Friday, in a private service for the disco star.
Gibb, singer with one of the biggest-selling groups of all time and a key figure in the breakthrough of disco, died on May 20 aged 62, having lost his battle against cancer.
The service will take place from 1:30 pm (1230 GMT) at St Mary's Church in Thame, Oxfordshire.
A glass-sided carriage drawn by four horses will carry his coffin to the church from his home of many years, with fans expected to line the streets as it passes.
His son Robin-John has said that the Bee Gees' hit "I Started A Joke" will be played at the funeral, as will the track "Don't Cry Alone", from his Titanic Requiem, which premiered weeks before his death.
His family said that it was Gibb's wish to "say a final goodbye to fans and his home town of Thame".
Although Friday's ceremony is a private service for close family and friends, a memorial service will be held later this year.
The Bee Gees -- brothers Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibb -- helped turn disco into a global phenomenon in the 1970s with hits such as "How Deep Is Your Love", "Stayin' Alive", and "Night Fever".
Although originally from the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, they grew up in Manchester and Australia and were singing publicly from childhood.
Born on December 22, 1949, Robin was 17 when he sang lead vocals on the Bee Gees' first British number one, "Massachusetts", in 1967, before they switched styles to disco in the 1970s.
The trio's sharp songwriting and immaculate harmonies helped them notch up record sales of more than 200 million.
