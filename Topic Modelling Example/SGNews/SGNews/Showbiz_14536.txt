Guang Ming Daily reported that Hong Kong superstar Cecilia Cheung would be taking a break from her career this year to look after her children.
Cheung, the ex-wife of Hong Kong actor Nicholas Tse, said she wanted to focus on bringing up her sons Lucas and Quintus.
"My kids are the centre of my life. I will put aside my work to spend more time with them," she said, adding that she did not spend much time with them last year due to her busy schedule.
Cheung and Tse divorced last year but there are rumours they may get back together.
