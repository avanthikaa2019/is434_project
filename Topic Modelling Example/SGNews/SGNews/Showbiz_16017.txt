US pop diva Lady Gaga thanked "all the adults in Korea who are speaking out for (the) underaged who want to come to the BTW Ball" via Twitter on Tuesday.
"Maybe the government will change their mind," said the singer.
She also added that parents should be "given more credit" to determine what's good for their children.
Lady Gaga's upcoming Seoul concert "The Born This Way Ball," to be held on April 27 at the Olympic Stadium in southeastern Seoul, has been restricted to over-18s by the Korea Media Rating Board.
The concert is the fourth foreign artist show to be banned for teenagers, according to KMRB. The first was Marilyn Manson's 2005 Seoul show, while the second and the third were American rappers 50 Cent and Jay-Z's concerts, both held in 2006.
