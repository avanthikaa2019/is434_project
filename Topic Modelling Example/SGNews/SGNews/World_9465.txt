ANKARA - Turkey will treat any Syrian military units which approach its border as a threat and a military target, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday.
Erdogan also said Turkey was totally in the right over Syria's shooting down of a Turkish plane and that Ankara's rational response to the incident should not be mistaken for weakness.
&ldquo;Everybody should know that Turkey's wrath is just as strong and devastating,&rdquo; Erdogan said in a speech to his ruling AK Party deputies in parliament.
The army's rules of engagement along the two countries' border had now changed, he said.
&ldquo;Every military element approaching Turkey from the Syrian border and representing a security risk and danger will be assessed as a military threat and will be treated as a military target,&rdquo; he said.
Turkey has demanded backing from its NATO allies over the shoot down and has called a meeting in Brussels under Article 4 of the alliance's charter, which provides for consultations when a member state feels its territorial integrity or security is under threat.
Turkey has rejected assertions from Damascus that its forces had no option but to fire on the F-4 jet as it flew over Syrian waters close to the coast on Friday and has branded the shooting an &ldquo;act of aggression&rdquo;. It says the aircraft was an unarmed reconnaissance plane flying over international waters.
The incident has heightened tensions between Turkey and Syria already strained over the 16-month uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule.
