SINGAPORE - Minister for Education Mr Heng Swee Keat responded today to NMP Mr Yee Jenn Jong's queries on foreign scholars who are sponsored by the Singapore Government.
Mr Jong had asked the about the number of foreign scholars who actually do complete their obligations after graduation and the number of scholars who had taken up Singapore citizenship over the past 15 years.
Mr Heng revealed that more than 80 per cent of the scholars from ASEAN, China and India complete their service obligations after graduation and most of the rest were granted deferment for further education.
However, they are still required to serve their obligations upon graduation.
He also said that almost all the scholars who graduate take up permanent residency or citizenship, with about 15 per cent converting to citizens within five years of graduation.
