TAIPEI - The number of Taiwanese people with a college, university or other type of higher education degree has increased year by year to 39 per cent of the whole population in 2009, according to statistics released by the Ministry of the Interior Saturday.
Compared with other countries, Taiwan's higher education population stands higher than the average 30 per cent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) member states.
It ties with South Korea's 39 per cent, but is lower than Japan's 44 per cent, the findings show.
Taiwan's high education population also stands lower than Canada's 49 per cent, the United States' 41 per cent and New Zealand's 40 per cent, while being higher than Germany's 26 per cent, Britain's 37 per cent, France's 30 per cent, Switzerland's 35 per cent, Norway's 37 per cent, and Sweden's 33 per cent.
The statistics on the education level of people over 15 years old show that by the end of 2011, 38.2 per cent of such Taiwanese people are college or university degree holders, while 32.3 per cent were high school or vocational high school graduates.
Some 7.53 million Taiwanese people have completed their higher education as of last Dec. 31, interior ministry officials said.
The percentage of people in Taiwan who have obtained a higher education degree has increased by 15.2 percentage points in the past 10 years amid a drop in the illiterate population, which fell to 1.8 per cent at the end of last year, officials said.
In terms of ages, 28.7 per cent of Taiwanese men aged above 40 completed higher education, while 20 per cent of Taiwanese women older than 40 years old are in the higher education bracket.
However, the percentage of women younger than 40 years old and with a degree in higher education reached 57.2 per cent, higher than men's 53.3 per cent in the same age group, the government statistics show.
