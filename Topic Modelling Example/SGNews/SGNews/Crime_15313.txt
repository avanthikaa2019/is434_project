Two bundles believed to contain heroin were found in a hidden compartment of a car which was stopped for checks on April 12 at the Woodlands Checkpoint.
A Malaysian-registered gold-coloured car driven by a Malaysian Indian, 24, was stopped by Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at about 5am.
The lone-driver was interviewed and upon inspection of the car, two bundles wrapped with black masking tape were found in a hidden compartment beneath the centre armrest console.
The bundles are believed to contain approximately two pounds, or 920 grammes, of heroin, worth about $138,000.
The suspect was arrested immediately and handed over to CNB for further investigations.
If found guilty, the man may face the death penalty.
