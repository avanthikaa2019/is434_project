Any news revolving around Shu Qi is likely to centre on her love life.
Is she dating singer Wang Leehom? Or what about Stephen Fung?
Or anyone for that matter, but we'll never know because she will never tell.
The Taiwanese star, who was in town yesterday to help officiate the reopening of the Emporio Armani store in Suria KLCC, told a mob of reporters that unless they have photographic evidence of her and a man, she would not be answering any questions pertaining to the issue.
Journalists then asked if the Gorgeous actress would be open to the idea of dating someone outside the entertainment industry such as her best friend Kelly Lin. (Lin is married to American Chinese entrepreneur Chris Young.)
"It depends on destiny.
"If we are meant to be, we are meant be," said the 36-year-old, who has declared this year as a year of rest, after having worked without a break for a few years.
On her role as the Italian fashion house's testimonial in China, Singapore and Malaysia since its Fall/Winter 2010 collection, Shu Qi said she's very happy and proud to be selected as an ambassador.
She revealed that it has since taught her a lot about fashion.
"I'm more of a T-shirt and jeans sort of person. I'm rather clueless when it comes to fashion so I'm very happy and excited to be given this opportunity to work with a fashion brand.
"I also have to thank my parents for blessing me with such an hour-glass figure."
Shu Qi was recently seen in the movies Love and The Second Woman, and the upcoming Odyssey, which is currently in post-production.
The Emporio Armani store is located on the ground floor of Suria KLCC and covers about 310 sq m. Its interior has been carefully conceptualised by designer Giorgio Armani himself.
