James Cameron - the director of box office smashes Titanic and Avatar, who is known for his cutting-edge special effects - may soon work on a 3D Chinese film.
Cameron told a news conference at the Second Beijing International Film Festival on Monday that his company would probably join the crew of The Art of War - a 3D Chinese film based on the classic book about military strategies.
"We are still in discussions but have agreed on the principles that we will provide certain service to ensure the quality of 3D," he said.
The film's director, Hu Bo, approached him a year ago and sought opportunities for his company to provide 3D camera and technology for the first epic 3D film in China.
"There is no signed agreement now, but we are very excited about the possibilities to work with Chinese companies, especially when China as a market has been expanding so rapidly," Cameron said.
China has become the second-largest box office contributor outside North America for many Hollywood blockbusters, including Avatar - which grossed 1.3 billion yuan (S$259 million), about eight per cent of the film's global box office revenue.
Titanic 3D has raked in more than 500 million yuan within two weeks in Chinese theaters.
