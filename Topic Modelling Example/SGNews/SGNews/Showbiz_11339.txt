LOS ANGELES - Actress Drew Barrymore married her art dealer beau on Saturday at her Montecito, California home, the third trip down the aisle for the Hollywood star.
The star-studded guest list for the nuptials of Barrymore, 37, and Will Kopelman, 34, included actress Cameron Diaz and comedian Jimmy Fallon, according to the celebrity magazine People.
In keeping with the fact that her husband's father is a former Chanel CEO, Barrymore wore a long, white Chanel dressed pleated in muslin and organza, created for her by superstar designer Karl Lagerfeld, according to E! Online.
The groom's family rabbi was flown in from New York to preside over the ceremony at which children of the couple's friends served as flower girls and ring bearers.
Barrymore chose an 1980s tribute band for the reception, E! Online reported. The bride and groom were snapped kissing as they departed in a chauffeur-driven limousine with streamers and roses tied to the back.
Barrymore, who is currently pregnant, was previously married to bar owner Jeremy Thomas for two months in 1994 and comedian Tom Green from 2001 to 2002.
Her whirlwind romance with Kopelman began last year and they got engaged five months ago.
The actress, a member of one of America's most illustrious families of film and stage, made her debut as a child star in the 1982 Hollywood blockbuster "E.T."
She has since appeared in a string of films, most of them romantic comedies, including "The Wedding Singer" and "Ever After: A Cinderella Story."
