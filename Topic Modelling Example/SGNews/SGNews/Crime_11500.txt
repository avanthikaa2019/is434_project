SINGAPORE - A former baggage handler, who had committed a spate of baggage thefts in Changi Airport in 2010 and 2011, was sentenced to 10 months' jail on Friday for one charge of theft of a pair of earrings and five charges of helping to dispose of stolen items.
Jufri Jaffar, 33, and his alleged accomplice, Nizam Adnan, 43, pawned the stolen jewellery, and the total amount came up to $29,753, reported The Straits Times. Fifteen other charges of disposing stolen property were considered during Jufri's sentencing.
A district court heard last month that Jufri, employed by Asia Pacific Star, opened an unlocked luggage and stole pair of gold earrings worth $136 while he was working at Budget Terminal, Changi Airport, on May 26 last year.
He passed the earrings to Nizam who pawned it at a Maxi-Cash outlet for $120, reported The Straits Times.
Investigations showed that Jufri was also involved in a spate of baggage thefts in 2010 and 2011, stealing various items, especially gold jewellery.
From September 2010 to May 2011, he and Nizam went to Maxi-Cash outlets where Nizam pawned the jewellery for $1,850 and $6,100.
Nizam's case is still pending.
