ENNISKILLEN, Northern Ireland - A "viable explosive device" discovered on a small plane at an airport in Northern Ireland was removed by army bomb disposal experts, police said Tuesday.
The bomb was found on the English-registered plane at St Angelo airport near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.
Police said they were called to the regional airport shortly after 8pm local time on Monday and subsequently closed the main Enniskillen to Kesh road.
Police gave no indication as to the type of explosive device found.
Sporadic unrest and bomb threats continue in the province despite the 1998 peace accords that largely ended the Troubles, the three decades of sectarian violence between Protestants and Catholics that left more than 3,000 dead.
