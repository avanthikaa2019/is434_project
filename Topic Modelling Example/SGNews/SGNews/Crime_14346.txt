A doctor has been convicted of failing to stop after an accident, render aid, and remove his car without lawful authority.
General practitioner Teo Tiong Kiat, 64, had earlier said that he did not know he had hit two cyclists during an accident when he lost control of his car and ended up killing one of the riders.
The Straits Times reported that District Judge John Ng said he was satisfied that Teo had failed to show that he was not aware that he was involved in the accident on the balance of probabilities.
Teo had earlier admitted to causing the death of freelance writer Benjamin Mok Chee Kong, 35, and injuring another cyclist, Bertram Leong Poh Meng, 24, by failing to keep a proper lookout when swerving from the centre to the left lane and hit the rear of the two pedal cyclists.
The accident had happened along Clementi Road on March 21, 2010.
The Straits Times report said that Teo's defence to the three charges is that he had fallen asleep at the wheel and he was not aware that he had been involved in the accident.
But Judge Ng said all the evidence made it impossible to accept Teo's assertion that he was not aware that that he was involved, especially due to the severe damage to the car.
It was "simply untenable" for him to claim ignorance, Judge Ng added.
The car's damage included a smashed front windscreen, a hole in the back windscreen where the rear view mirror had detached from, a damaged bonnet, a dented roof, and the light above the front seats had fallen from the ceiling.
The judge postponed sentencing on all five charges to May 25.
