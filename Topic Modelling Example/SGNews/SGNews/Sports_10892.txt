MANILA, Philippines - Eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao and undefeated challenger Timothy Bradley gave a preview of what's to come during their official weigh-in Saturday a day before their much-awaited fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA.
Pacquiao tipped the scales at exactly 147 lbs while the chiseled Bradley weighed a pound lighter at 146.
Pacquiao, heavily favored, will defend his WBO welterweight crown while Bradley looks to pull off a mighty upset and keep his unbeaten streak going.
