During today's Parliament sitting, Dr Lee Bee Wah asked whether the Ministry of Law would consider regulating pawn shop advertisements.
Currently, it has been observed that pawnbrokers advertise mainly through the platforms of TV, radio, buses, taxis and the MRT. These advertisements are taken out by some of the bigger players in the industry.
In response, Mr K Shanmugam said that the Ministry of Law will look into introducing measures to regulate the content of pawnbroking advertisements.
Regulation would likely include stipulating that such advertisements must not be misleading, and must not encourage gambling.
The Ministry will continue to monitor the situation, to see whether there is a need for even stronger regulatory action, such as restricting pawnbrokers' advertising channels.
It is also in the midst of reviewing the Pawnbrokers Act, with a view to strengthening protection for pawners and enhancing corporate governance for pawnbrokers.
While Dr Lee raised the concern that pawn shop advertisements may give consumers the impression that they have easy access to ready cash whenever they need money, Mr Shanmugam pointed out that pawnbroking loans are essentially secured loans.
The pawner needs to furnish items of personal property as collateral for a loan. The amount of loan the pawner can take is limited by the value of his collateral. He does not have to come up with cash to service the loan. If the pawner fails to repay the loan, he forfeits the collateral.
Such loans are therefore quite unlike unsecured loans given by moneylenders, where there is much higher potential for individuals to borrow beyond their means to repay.
