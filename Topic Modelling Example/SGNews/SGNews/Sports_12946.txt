SYDNEY - Former English Premier League player Ian Crook was Monday promoted from youth coach to head coach of Sydney FC for the next two Australian A-League seasons.
Crook, 49, who was assistant coach alongside German Pierre Littbarski when Sydney FC won the inaugural A-League Championship in 2005-06, replaces Czech Vitezslav Lavicka.
Crook has coached in Asia, England and Australia following a 15-season playing career in the English Premier League with Tottenham and Norwich City, making a combined 457 appearances for the two clubs.
He has spent the last two years as the Sydney FC youth team coach since leaving England where he was first team coach at Norwich City, helping them win promotion to the English Championship in 2009-10.
Crook has brought young players Joel Chianese, Terry Antonis and Mitch Mallia into the senior squad and takes on the head role after Sydney FC last week failed to land former Socceroo coach Graham Arnold from A-League rivals, Central Coast Mariners.
He becomes become Sydney's sixth coach heading into the eighth season of the A-League, following Littbarski, Terry Butcher, Branko Culina, John Kosmina and Lavicka, who has returned Europe after three seasons in charge.
The Sky Blues had also sought former Socceroo defender Tony Popovic as their head coach, but reports have linked Popovic with new A-League club Western Sydney.
