TOKYO - Japan's coastguard on Thursday arrested two Chinese crew after a collision last week between their cargo vessel and a fishing boat that left at least one man dead.
Lin Shi, 29, and Wang Qing Lin, 22, were taken to a coastguard facility in Ishikawa prefecture, some 300 kilometres (190 miles) northwest of Tokyo, a coastguard official said.
The two, crew on the 9,800-tonne Yong Cai, were arrested Thursday over the incident on Sunday in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) in which their vessel collided with the fishing boat Daini Shinyo Maru, the official said.
Following the accident, the 76-year-old captain of the fishing boat was found dead. His son, who was also aboard, was still missing, the official said.
