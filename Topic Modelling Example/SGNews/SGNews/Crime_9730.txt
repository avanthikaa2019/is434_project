JOHOR BAHRU - Hearing the screams of a boy from a neighbour's house, a couple rushed there and were shocked to see their grandson tied up and five grown-ups taking turns to beat the boy with a rubber hose.
"One of the men also used a lighted cigarette to burn my grandson and all we could do was watch in horror," said housewife M. Valli, 43.
"My husband and I tried in vain to rescue the boy but the group kept hitting us," she said yesterday.
The incident allegedly happened on June 13 outside her neighbour's home in Ulu Tiram after S. Letchumanan, 10, was accused of stealing a metal pipe from the house.
Valli alleged the boy's hands and legs were tied while her neighbour and four of his relatives took turns to belt him with the rubber hose while spraying him with water.
The more than five-hour ordeal only stopped when Letchumanan's father returned from work and called the police at around 10.30pm.
"My grandson suffered injuries on his left hand, buttocks and thighs and has been warded at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital," said Valli, adding her grandson was traumatised by the attack and would occasionally break into tears.
The family has since left their home to temporarily live in Skudai as they fear for their safety.
They lodged a police report against the child's alleged assailants on June 21.
"What they did to my grandson is unacceptable," said Valli, saying her grandson admitted he had followed a few friends who were selling stolen metal pipes.
Seri Alam OCPD Supt Ruslan Zainuddin said the police were investigating the matter under Section 324 of the Penal Code for causing grievous hurt.
