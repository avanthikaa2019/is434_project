Comedian Baek Jae-hyeon said he lost 40 kilograms through nearly a year of rigorous exercise.
Baek used to weigh 118 kg and went to a hospital for a general medical checkup in February last year.
The doctor said Baek had six years left due to high risks for diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.
Once he lost 40 kilos, he went on to have plastic surgery on his mouth, eyes and nose.
His story will be featured on a TV morning show on Thursday on KBS.
