Fourteen years after 1998's terrifying original Ring, everything has gone PC.
That's short for personal computer because, instead of a spooky video tape, the deadly "cursed video clip" is now passed around online and the ghost crawls out like a bad Internet virus.
Worse, Sadako spider-clones attack en masse as though they're in AVS - Alien vs Samurai.
What has become of good horror? Why did the producers dumb down something as sacred as the Sadako legend into silly putty for kids? Even one strand of the hair of that first Sadako is far scarier than this.
SADAKO (NC16) Horror/96 minutes Rating: 1/5 stars
