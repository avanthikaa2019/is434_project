SINGAPORE - A 50-year-old financial adviser is under investigation for practicing without a licence.
Last October, she was called in by the Commercial Affairs Department for questioning, reported The Straits Times.
Under the Financial Advisers Act, she is required to have a licence because she invests in funds, equities and shares on her clients' behalf.
The woman, who talked to the paper on condition of anonymity, allegedly owes more than $20 million to her clients. She said she did not know that she needed a licence, and is scared that the publicity will ruin her business.
She related that she started investing for other people in 2008 after people heard of her success in investing for herself. However, her woes began due to bad decisions related to the Japan earthquake and the European financial crisis.
17 civil lawsuits were filed against her between March and December last year from clients trying to claim their money. These clients include creditors, businessmen and women, and housewives.
Eight of these cases are still pending, while the rest are either discontinued or judgment has been made in Chambers.
According to the paper, she promised her clients, some of whom are friends who she has been dealing with for over five years, returns of up to 13 per cent a year.
Her company is currently not operating while the investigations are ongoing, with the accounts frozen by CAD.
She told the paper that she wants to pay her clients back, as she knows 'it's people's hard-earned money'.
