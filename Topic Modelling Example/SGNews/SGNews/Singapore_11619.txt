SINGAPORE The food centre at Toa Payoh Block 75 in Lorong 5 will have a new look from next year, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Thursday.
From June 1 to January 2013, the food centre will be closed for renovations.
Under the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP), the improved centre will have an increased seating capacity from 58 to 112 tables and 342 to 460 seats.
Cooked food stalls will be equipped with new mechanical exhaust systems to improve the ventilation within the centre.
Public toilet facilities will also be upgraded and will incorporate child-friendly features.
An extension canopy will also be installed along the perimeter of the centre to provide patrons with better shelter.
The exterior will also sport a fresher, modern look "to enhance the festivity and vibrancy of the upgraded centre", said NEA.
Other key aspects of the programme include improvements to the electrical, plumbing and sanitary systems, provision of roller shutters and new signboards for all cooked food stalls, as well as the installation of new fans and light fittings.
To date, 98 hawker centres have been upgraded under the HUP.
Some of the hawker centres currently undergoing upgrading include Blk 85 Bedok North Street 4 and Blk 16 Bedok South Road.
