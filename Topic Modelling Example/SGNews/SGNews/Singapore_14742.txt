SINGAPORE - An Indonesian maid fell to her death from a HDB flat on Thursday morning - the seventh fatal fall from height this year involving foreign domestic workers.
The 34-year-old was believed to be cleaning the windows of the fifth-floor unit at Block 174C of Edgedale Plains, when she fell at around 5.25am.
A neighbour whom The Straits Times interviewed said a loud thump was heard at 5.20am.
The housewife, 50, initially thought the sound was from a bundle of newspapers which was being delivered, but later saw police cars arriving at the scene.
According to Shin Min Daily News, neighbours said the maid had been working with her employer for over a year and helps to look after the employer's elderly mother.
She is believed to be married and of a cheery and friendly disposition.
When interviewed, the employer told Shin Min that she was sleeping and unaware that her maid had fallen until the police informed her. She said she often instructed her maid to be careful when doing housework.
Police have classified the case as an unnatural death, and are investigating.
