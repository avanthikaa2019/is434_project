Eleven people were arrested for drug trafficking in an island-wide anti-drug trafficking sweep where a total of 93 suspected drug offenders were also rounded up.
Drugs worth almost $54,000 were seized.
In one case, Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers arrested a couple suspected to be trafficking in heroin and 'Ice' from their HDB flat in Jalan Berseh.
On May 30, CNB officers arrested a 39-year-old Singaporean man along the corridor of his HDB flat after a fierce struggle. At the time of arrest, the man was carrying two packets of cannabis weighing about two grams and one straw of heroin.
The man's wife, a 35-year-old Singaporean woman, is also suspected to be helping her husband sell drugs.
