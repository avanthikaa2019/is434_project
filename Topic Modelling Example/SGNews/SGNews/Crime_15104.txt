A 34-year-old woman was arrested by the police for suspected involvement in loansharking activities.
She was arrested in the Hougang Ave 9 area on April 13 at about 9.30pm after follow-up investigations.
Preliminary investigations indicate that the suspect opened a bank account and gave her ATM card and Personal Identification Number (PIN) to a loansharking syndicate to facilitate the business of unlicensed moneylending.
Investigation against the suspect is ongoing.
Under the Moneylenders Act (Revised Edition 2010), a person is presumed to have assisted an unlicensed moneylender if a bank account or ATM card is used to facilitate a moneylending business run by an unlicensed moneylender.
Those found guilty of assisting loansharks can be fined between $30,000 and $300,000, jailed up to four years.
They can also be caned up to six strokes.
