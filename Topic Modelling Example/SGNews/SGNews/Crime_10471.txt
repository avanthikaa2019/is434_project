BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN - Nine arrests relating to immigration offences have been made in the Brunei-Muara and Belait districts over the past few days, according to reports from the Enforcement division of the Immigration Department (JIPK).
On Monday, June 11, during a raid at a rented house in Kg Anggerek Desa, Berakas, JIPK had apprehended three foreign males for failing to produce documentation with valid immigration passes.
JIPK reported that the men had tried to flee from enforcement officers, but were recaptured not far away.
In addition to immigration offences, two cases of 'Khalwat'(male and female in close proximity) were reported by the JIPK to the Religious Enforcement Division.
A customs case was also referred to the Royal Custom and Excise Department when the officers discovered a foreigner with seven bottles of wine and three different brands of cigarettes without health warnings.
JIPK also reported that a raid in Kg Sungai Tilong, Jln Muara resulted in two suspects being referred to the Narcotics Control Bureau for smoking syabu (methampethamine), after equipment which is suspected to have been used for the substance was found.
In a separate operation conducted last Saturday, JIPK's Kuala Belait branch conducted inspections on a foreign worker residence in Lumut.
The inspections resulted in six arrests, two of which were employees who have been reported to have run away from their original employers.
JIPK also noted that the rest were detained to verify their original passports.
JIPK would like to remind the public, especially foreign nationals, to comply with the Immigration Act and Regulations.
Any information about the offences under the Immigration Act and Regulations and suspicious activities can be reported by the public through their hotline at 8753888 and 8734888 at any time.
Reports will be kept confidential, stated the JIPK.
