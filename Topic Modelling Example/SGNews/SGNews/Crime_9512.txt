GEORGE TOWN - A snatch thief excreted in his pants when he was caught following a brief chase after he grabbed a bag containing RM18,000 (S$7,220).
The 27-year-old man had earlier stolen the bag from a Sin Chew Daily employee who had parked his motorcycle in Bertam Lane.
The suspect was believed to have tailed his 49-year-old victim for some distance before deciding to strike at about 11am yesterday.
As the thief made a quick dash across the busy Penang Road, the victim shouted for help.
Several passers-by responded by giving chase and pouncing on the suspect at Lebuh Tek Soon. They also hit the suspect.
As the police carried him away later, a policeman was heard telling the suspect: "You'll be going to jail for this."
The policemen then smelled a foul odour and pinched their noses. Apparently afraid he would be spending time in prison, the suspect lost control of his bowels.
George Town OCPD Asst Comm Gan Kong Meng praised the passers-by who made the citizen's arrest.
However, commenting on the beating of the culprit, he advised the public: "Do not take the law into your own hands."
He said the case was being investigated under Section 379 of the Penal Code for stealing.
The bag and the money were returned to the victim.
