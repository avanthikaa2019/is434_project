LOS ANGELES - Hollywood stars welcomed Barack Obama's public endorsement of same-sex marriage, as the US president jetted in Thursday for a record-breaking fundraiser in Tinseltown.
Gay celebrities lined up to hail the decision, which risks making the issue a key election year battle issue as likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney immediately opposed Obama's position.
"Pretty darn happy today. Thanks Mr President, for supporting the dignity of my family and so many others!" said actress Jane Lynch of hit TV series "Glee" on her Twitter feed.
"What an amazing day for our country," said talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, one of the first to welcome the statement Wednesday.
"There have been moments in history when someone has had the courage to stand up for what they believe in, and that one action changes everything and I hope that this is one of those times."
Obama headed to Los Angeles for a star-studded fundraiser with Hollywood A-lister George Clooney, expected to earn a record-breaking US$15 million (S$18.8 million) for his re-election coffers, according to reports.
Celebrities expected to attend include actors Jack Black, Billy Crystal, Robert Downey Junior, Salma Hayek, Barbra Streisand and Eddie Murphy, an Obama campaign official said.
After Obama's announcement Jesse Tyler Ferguson of "Modern Family" tweeted: "I would like to marry @BarackObama right now!" after asking permission from Michelle Obama and his own partner, Justin Mikita.
Lady Gaga tweeted: "Obama, congratulations on being the first sitting President to support marriage equality. Feels like the future, and not the past."
DeGeneres stood up to lead her audience in applause for Obama, adding: "It takes a brave man to take a stand like this, especially in an election year, so Mr. President, I say thank you very, very, very much."
