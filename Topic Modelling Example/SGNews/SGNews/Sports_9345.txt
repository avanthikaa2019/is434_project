Manchester City's Under- 15 side marched into the Lion City Cup semi-finals with a 6-0 thrashing of the Singapore U-15s, at the Jalan Besar Stadium last night.
Two goals from striker Joseph Nuttall and a goal each from Marcus Wood, Aaron Nemane, Lukas Nmecha and Joseph Hardy sealed the big win for City.
They qualified as Group B winners, with second-placed Vasco Da Gama of Brazil joining them in the last four.
Earlier yesterday, Ajax Amsterdam's U-15 side also qualified for the semi-finals with a 3-1 win over the FC Porto U-15s.
The Dutch side had lost 1-2 to Singapore's U-16 side in last Saturday's tournament opener and need to beat Porto - who drew 0-0 with the Cubs on Monday - to join the Cubs in the final four from Group A.
They took full advantage of having two more days of rest than their Portuguese opponents, and attacked from the opening whistle.
Eventually, they took the lead in the 19th minute, via a superb shot from a tight angle from striker Ezra Walian.
With left winger Vince Dekker in fine fettle, they doubled their lead three minutes later, when Donny van de Beek met Dekker's cross with a stinging volley to score.
Porto pulled a goal back a minute before half-time through Leandro Ribeiro, but Ajax restored their two-goal cushion six minutes after the break, when an unmarked Walian tapped home another fine cross from Dekker.
The semi-finals will be held tomorrow, while the final will be on Sunday at Jalan Besar Stadium.
