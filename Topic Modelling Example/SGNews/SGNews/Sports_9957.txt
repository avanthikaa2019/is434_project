Three days after recording the biggest win of this Malaysian Super League season, the LionsXII team continued their winning run with a last-gasp 1-0 win over Terengganu at the Stadium Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah last night.
Substitute striker Sufian Anuar pounced with a superb strike in stoppage time for the victory. The Lions were expected to find it tough-going against the fourth-placed hosts, and indeed it was a far cry from their 9-0 demolition of Sabah at the Jalan Besar Stadium last Saturday.
While they remain top of the league, second-placed defending champions Kelantan remain in the driver's seat, having played five fewer matches.
In last night's rain-drenched encounter, the Lions struggled to find a way past the well-marshalled Terengganu defence.
There was bad news for the Lions on the half-hour mark, as striker Agu Casmir - who has rediscovered his scoring touch following a lengthy injury spell - limped off injured again.
But his replacement, Sufian, turned out to be the hero for the Lions, right at the death.
