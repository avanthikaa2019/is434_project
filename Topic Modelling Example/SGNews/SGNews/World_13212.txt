BEIRUT - Syria's main opposition group on Thursday said the regime in Damascus was behind two deadly blasts that rocked the capital, killing at least 29 people.
"The regime is behind this," said Samir Nashar, of the Syrian National Council's executive branch.
He said the aim of the blasts was to send a warning to UN observers monitoring a tenuous truce in Syria that they were in danger and to impress upon the international community that the regime was battling "terrorists."
"This is the only way for the regime to claim that what is happening in Syria is the work of terrorist gangs and that Al-Qaeda is expanding its presence in Syria," said Nashar, who is based in Turkey.
Thursday's blasts took place in front of a nine-storey security building, the facade of which was destroyed along with residential buildings nearby, an AFP correspondent at the site said.
The attacks came a day after the head of the UN observer mission in Syria escaped unharmed when a roadside bomb exploded as he led a team of UN observers into the southern flashpoint city of Daraa.
Ten Syrian soldiers escorting them were reportedly hurt in Wednesday's bombing.
Damascus has been the target of a number of bombs in past months as President Bashar al-Assad faces a revolt against his regime which his forces are attempting to crush.
