The suspect arrested hours after the fatal stabbing of a 25-year-old man in Bukit Merah on Monday was yesterday charged with murder.
Salesman Phua Kok Khoon, 38, is alleged to have murdered Mr Firman Hamik Abdul Halem at about 6pm in Bukit Merah Lane 2.
Phua, who wore a white polo T-shirt, appeared calm and collected as he stood in the dock to face the charge. He has been remanded for police investigations and will be back in court again on Wednesday. He was represented by lawyer Sunil Sudheesan.
Mr Firman suffered multiple open-wound injuries, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital where he died at about 7.30pm that day.
Phua turned himself in to the police shortly after the stabbing incident.
The alleged weapon, a knife, was recovered from the scene, reported Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao.
Phua is said to have been working as a salesman at Southern Motor, one of the many motorcycle shops which line Bukit Merah Lane 2.
If convicted, he faces the death penalty.
