SAN FRANCISCO - Andy Zhang's historic US Open appearance ended after two rounds last Friday, but the Beijing-born 14-year-old departed from The Olympic Club cherishing an exciting and unforgettable experience.
"Everything I did, I had never done before, and it's just a great experience," said Zhang, who is believed to be the youngest golfer to compete in the US Open.
Based in Florida, he said his late call-up into the tournament would boost his junior-golf career - and give him a goal as he tries to return next year.
"(On the) first day that I was on the tee, I was shaking a lot, and even after a few holes I was still really nervous, and today, I was on the tee - it got a lot better," he said.
"You can block out the crowds a little bit, and everything else. If I come back next year, I think I'll do a lot better."
Zhang had no problem picking out his highlight of the week, holing a putt from the fringe at 18 in the first round last Thursday.
"That was the loudest cheer I heard in my life from other people," he said.
During the week, Zhang revealed that one of his goals is to play for his native China at the 2016 Olympics although, so far, nothing has been done officially to pursue that aim.
