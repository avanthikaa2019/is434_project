SINGAPORE - People's Action Party candidate for Hougang, Mr Desmond Choo, said Hougang residents should focus on who can serve them better for the next four years.
He was referring to the furore that erupted over why Workers' Party candidate Png Eng Huat was not selected for the Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) spot, The Straits Times reported.
He told reporters on Thursday afternoon: "I know that there have been many comments regarding NCMP and other issues surrounding this, I thought that enough has been said.
"It is important to focus on the real issue at hand, which is about the two candidates, and selecting one that will serve them for the next four years."
He added: "Let's not lose focus - it is really about the residents, and they have to make that call."
