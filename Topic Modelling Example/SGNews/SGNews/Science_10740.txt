Tablets and screens are playing a bigger role in the beauty industry, with retailers equipping sales associates with iPads and computers being installed on store shelves to add an extra level of customized service.
According to a new report by market research group Mintel, beauty brands are increasingly tapping into the potential of digital technology to deliver an added layer of service for customers.
Clinique, for instance, has handed out iPads as an additional tool for client consultations, while Lanc&ocirc;me, Amore Pacific and Ioma have armed associates with computer diagnostic tools to help determine customers' skin types and choose the right products.
It's not just the beauty counter that's going high-tech. Urban Decay's Book of Shadows Volume IV is an eye shadow palette that doubles as a portable speaker and offers make-up tutorials with a scan of QR codes. The kit comes with a small, keychain speaker that's meant to amp up the sound of smartphones or MP3 players.
