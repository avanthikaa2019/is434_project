KATHMANDU - Rescuers dug through mud and debris on Monday searching for bodies after a flashflood swept through west Nepal killing at least 20 people and leaving dozens missing, police said.
A torrent of water swept away scores of houses, vehicles and a bridge near the resort town of Pokhara, about 125 km (80 miles) west of Kathmandu, after an avalanche which had blocked the Seti River gave way.
Forty-four people, including three Ukranian tourists, were still missing after the flood hit on Saturday, police said.
Pokhara is the second-biggest city of Nepal after Kathmandu and is the gateway to Mount Annapurna, the world's 10th-highest peak. Tourists begin their trek to the scenic Annapurna region from Pokhara.
