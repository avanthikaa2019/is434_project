PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Young starlet Bella Daly admits feeling excited and lucky to be given the opportunity to be part of the new RTM drama series Natrah.
Bella, whose real name is Nabilah Ali Daly, said being involved in the 13-episode series directed by Along Kamaludin was both an honour and a valuable experience.
"I've been on location for the series for two weeks. I play the lead role of Maria Huberdina Hertogh in her youth.
"As a rookie, I am grateful for the opportunity as this is an epic and historic script," she told mStar Online.
The Sabah native began her journey in acting after taking part in a casting call for the first season of Pilih Kasih, about three years ago.
On actor Nazim Othman, Bella said his caring and understanding ways put her at ease since starting a relationship with him six months ago.
"We acted in a drama production about two years ago but we weren't very close then. We started seeing each other after wrapping up filming for the drama Inspirasi Varsiti at the end of last year.
"I like how Nazim is understanding and protective of me in many matters. He is a mature guy and gives me guidance and advice drawn from his own experiences," she said.
The actress from the series Qalesya said she did not mind sharing details of her relationship with the public, but her focus for now was to make her mark in the local acting scene.
"My family knows about our relationship. In fact, I don't have a problem talking about our relationship to others because it won't affect our careers.
"For now, it would be best to talk about my acting career that's just starting," said the actress, who completed the new film version of Gila-Gila Remaja last month.
