An Indonesian maid was given a six-month jail sentence after admitting that she attempted to poison a maid agency employee.
Fitriani Atang Efendi, 25, was seen pouring a liquid car polisher into a water dispenser at Block 398 Yishun Ring Road on April 22, reported The Straits Times.
This attempt to cause Ms Jenny Chua Wah Kheng, 41, a customer service officer, to drink the water mixed with car polishing liquid was captured on CCTV. Another staff member, however, aciddentally drank the contaminated water that day.
She had run away from her employer and was being housed at the BCS Employment Services at Yishun Ring Road. It was unclear why she committed the act.
She could have been jailed for up to five years and fined for an offence of attempt to cause hurt by means of poison.
