"The assailant shot Nasrul several times before the other accomplice slashed the victim with a parang," he said.

Meanwhile, sundry shop owner Azizah Yusof, 49, said she and her daughter Nur Khairulnisa Mohd Yusuf, 22, went to check after hearing several gunshots outside her shop.
She said they saw a man lying in a pool of blood near a car with two armed men, both wearing crash helmets, standing close to the victim.
Upon seeing this, she and her daughter screamed for help but their reaction only caused the two men to panic and point the weapons at them.
"I was very scared as the weapons were held close to our necks. They kept pointing the gun at us for several seconds. I kept telling myself to be strong and prayed to God."
Despite the risks, Azizah said she and her daughter kept screaming with the hope of attracting other villagers to come to their aid.
"We are relieved the two men fled when the villagers came to our aid."
