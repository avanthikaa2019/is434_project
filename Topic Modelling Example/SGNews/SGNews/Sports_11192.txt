WARSAW - The Republic of Ireland arrived in Poland in the early hours of Tuesday, after playing their final Euro 2012 warm-up game against Hungary in Budapest.
Giovanni Trappatoni's side, who have been drawn against holders Spain, Italy and Croatia in a tough Group C, touched down in the Baltic port of Gdansk where they will be based for the tournament.
They play their opening match against Slaven Bilic's Croatia in the western city of Poznan on Sunday.
Monday's friendly, which ended goalless, was a chance for veteran goalkeeper Shay Given and defender John O'Shea to work on their fitness after both picked up injuries in the build-up to the tournament.
Aston Villa number one Given played just the first half but Sunderland's O'Shea came through the full match, which was watched by Bilic. The result leaves Ireland unbeaten in 14 games.
Portugal arrived late on Monday night in Poznan to prepare for their opening match against title contenders Germany in the Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday.
The Seleccao, hit by low morale and a string of poor results, also play Denmark and the Netherlands in Group B.
Croatia and Italy are both expected to arrive in Poland on Tuesday.
The 16-team tournament begins in Warsaw on Friday, with co-hosts Poland taking on Euro 2004 champions Greece.
