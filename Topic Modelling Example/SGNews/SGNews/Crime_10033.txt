On June 18 at about 5.30 pm, police officers were performing anti-crime rounds in Tampines when they spotted a suspect behaving suspiciously at the ground floor of one of the blocks.
The officers then conducted a check on him and loanshark-related paraphernalia such as handphones containing debtors' addresses, cans of paint and a marker were found in his possession.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect is believed to have just carried out an act of harassment at the said block.
The suspect will be charged in court on June 20, 2012.
