SINGAPORE - Police have arrested a 34 year-old man and six women, aged between 23 and 29, for their suspected involvement in online vice-related activities.
The arrests were the result of an operation mounted on June 15, where police officers raided three rented apartments located at St Michael's Road, Upper Thomson Road and Upper Changi Road.
Preliminarily investigations revealed that the illicit activities were advertised via the Internet, where potential customers could book its services.
A handphone, some transaction records and $4,652 in cash were seized during the raids.
Investigations are on-going.
Under the law, anybody who knowingly lives wholly or in part off earnings of the prostitution of another person can be fined up to $10,000, imprisoned for up to five years, or both.
Any male person who is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under the same law provision can be caned, in addition to any term of imprisonment imposed in respect to such an offence.
The police said that the raid is part of an ongoing enforcement effort to clamp down on vice activities and serves as a warning to those who conduct such illicit activities that they will not get away with it.
