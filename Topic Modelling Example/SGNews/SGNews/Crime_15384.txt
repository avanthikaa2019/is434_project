KOTA KINABALU, Malaysia - A woman was hurt after being thrown out of her four-wheel drive which was driven away by two robbers.
The woman, in her 40s, was waiting for her businessman husband who had gone to a bank in the city, with the vehicle's engine still running and the doors unlocked.
Sensing an opportunity, the robbers made their move, with one forcing his way into the driver's seat while the other dragged the woman out of the front passenger seat shortly before noon yesterday.
Deputy Kota Kinabalu police chief Supt M. Chandra said the robbers fled in the RM170,000 (S$69,955) vehicle.
The woman sought treatment while the 47-year-old husband lodged a report.
"Please lock your doors and don't take chances even if you are leaving your car for a short while," Supt Chandra said.
Meanwhile, a fisherman is in serious condition after being stabbed by a friend for not buying enough fish hooks here on Tuesday.
Mohd Faizal Matiyo, 30, is fighting for his life at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital after the suspect drove an 8cm-long keris into his chest on a boat near the city's Central Market.
The suspect, who is still at large, had given the fisherman RM4 to buy the hooks but was incensed when he came back with fewer hooks.
Supt Chandra said police had found the keris with bloodstains and a hunt was on for the suspect.
