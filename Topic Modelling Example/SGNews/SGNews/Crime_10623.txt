SINGAPORE - A prisoner who was due to be released in two months' time will spend another 30 months in jail for two other offences, reported The Straits Times.
Leong Soon Kheong, 37, was jailed for the murder of 18-year-old Wang Dao Jing at Lucky Chinatown in 2003.
Leong pleaded guilty to furnishing false information to the police while in lock-up, by implicating Larry Lim Liang Long, 32, as being involved in the assault on Wang.
He also pleaded guilty to falsely admitting to the statement of facts implicating Lim as one of the accomplices involved in the assault during his High Court trial in September 2008.
Leong was among five men who attacked Dao Jing for allegedly stealing a backpack belonging to one of them at the shopping mall on Feb 15, 2003. Dao Jing died later in hospital of his injuries.
Four of the five men fled to Malaysia, where they met up with Lim, who is wanted by police here for copyright infringement offences.
Lim agreed to take the rap for the fifth person who remained in Singapore, known as "Ka Juak", to protect his identity.
Leong was given 12 months for furnishing false information and 18 months for perverting the course of justice. Both sentences were ordered to run consecutively.
The case against Lim is pending.
