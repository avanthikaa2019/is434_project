A lorry driver has been jailed for one week and banned from driving for three years for causing the death of a pedestrian, reported The Straits Times.
Muhammad Jufri Sukaimi, 38, came to a stop at the junction of Orchard Road and Grange Road when the traffic light signal was red in March 2011.
He made a right turn when the lights turned green and ended up hitting Madam Han Ai Lian, 61, who was crossing about six metres away from the pedestrian crossing line.
The Straits Times reported that she died two days later from bleeding due to blunt force injury to the pelvis and left lower limb.
Madam Han was on her way to work as a cleaner at Cathay Cineleisure Orchard.
Muhammad Jufri pleaded guilty to the accident.
He could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined for the offence.
