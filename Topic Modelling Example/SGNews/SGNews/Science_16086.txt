TAIPEI - Archaeologists have recently discovered the remains of a man that are believed to be between 7,500 and 7,900 years old, the oldest skeleton of the Neolithic era that has ever been discovered in Taiwan, one of the archaeologists said Monday.
Found on the outlying island of Mastu last December, the remains are estimated to be those of a man aged between 30 and 35 years at the time of death and as tall as 167 cm, said Jonas Chen, leader of the team that uncovered the skull and other bones.
Chen, a researcher at Academia Sinica, has named the remains "Liangdao Man" to reflect the site where the bones have been found - Liangdao, one of several islets that comprise the Matsu archipelago.
The man was buried in a fetal position, meaning that he was found with his legs drawn up toward his chest, Chen told CNA in a telephone interview.
Analysis of the remains indicate that in life he had strong arms and legs, Chen added.
