Last Friday, this New Zealand singer-songwriter (real name Hollie Fullbrook) played her first intimate Singapore gig, and the reviews were glowing.
No surprise, as her full-length debut is minimalist and, thanks to her wispy lilt, quite lovely.
Folksy numbers like Adelphi Apartments perfectly showcase her story- telling style of songwriting, mak- ing the listener feel like he's in on every little secret.
Tiny Ruins Some Were Meant For Sea (Spunk) 3.5/5 stars
