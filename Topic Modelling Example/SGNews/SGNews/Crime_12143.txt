A 25-year-old man who raped a girl he met through a pen pal column in a teen magazine has had his appeal dismissed yesterday.
The Court of Appeal upheld Wang Jianbin's sentence of 13 years of jail and 15 strokes of the cane.
In 2009, Wang had raped a 13-year-old girl in her bedroom after chasing off her male friend who tried to stop him.
Justice Chao Hick Tin explained his decision as it was a horrendous case that was unusual, because the rapist had gone to the victim's home and attacked her in the presence of others, reported The Straits Times.
He added that if the prosecution had appealed, his sentence could have been longer.
Wang, then a 23-year-old polytechnic student, had started chatting with the schoolgirl online after seeing her address in a magazine. However, he then started to send her sexually explicit messages and insisted to meet.
He showed up at her flat about two months after they had started chatting online, and threatened her and demanded to enter her room, according to The New Paper reports. She complied out of fear.
She also thought she would not come to harm as her brother and his piano teacher were in the living room and she also had two male friends in her home to help protect her.
In her room, Wang began to molest her. One of her friends came in and tried to help, however he was chased out eventually, according to reports. He and the other friend called the police.
Wang was arrested at the scene. He pleaded guilty to statutory rape last year. Charges of criminal intimidation and sexual assault of a minor were taken into consideration at sentencing.
For statutory rape, Wang could have been sentenced up to 20 years' jail, and either caning or a fine.
