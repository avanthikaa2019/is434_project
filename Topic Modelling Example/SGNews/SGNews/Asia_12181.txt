The government rejected a remark by a senior Chinese official who said China has a core interest in the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said Wednesday.
Wang Jiarui, the head of the Communist Party of China's international department, made the remark during a meeting in Beijing Tuesday with former House of Councillors President Satsuki Eda.
It was the first time a senior Chinese official has said the Senkaku Islands are a core interest for China, which calls the islands Daioyu.
No government official attended the meeting, Fujimura said at a press conference.
"We of course will closely watch the words and actions of the Chinese side over the Senkaku Islands," he said.
But he added, "Any remarks from the Chinese side will not affect our country's basic stance" that the islands are Japanese territory.
