As the movie Avengers premieres worldwide, the rumour mill has set fast on Iron Man 3 where pre-production is said to have begun.
According to reports, Walt Disney Co said it would co-produce its next Iron Man movie with Beijing-based DMG Entertainment to forge closer ties with China's film industry.
The film will be shot in China.
With that, Hong Kong website Neonpunch reported that Andy Lau is a likely choice for a Chinese character in the movie.
Speculation at first pointed to Lau possibly playing the villain role of The Mandarin but reports also said otherwise.
They stated that since being shot in and co-produced in China, it would be inappropriate and in bad taste to have a Chinese villain.
So instead, Lau is likely to play a scientist that represents China's technology sector who is an old friend to protagonist Tony Stark.
Neonpunch said Lau "will use China's armored heroes to help Iron Man defeat The Mandarin who is seen as a terrorist against both the US and China."
If Lau is part of the film, he will be joining a cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce.
Scarlett Johansson, however, according to Aceshowbiz.com, says she will not return as The Black Widow and has instead suggested a stand-alone movie for her character.
