MELBOURNE - Two adults and two children, believed to be a Fijian-Indian family, were found dead inside a Melbourne house Tuesday in a case police termed a "tragedy".
Detectives said they went to the premises after a relative expressed concern and found the bodies inside, including a young boy and girl.
Senior Sergeant David Snare would not be drawn on any potential cause of death until post-mortem examinations were undertaken, and refused to comment on whether there were any clues inside the house.
"We haven't ruled anything in or anything out," Snare told reporters.
"It's a tragedy," he added. "You've got two adults and two children. It's a family unit and it's just nasty, that's all."
A relative told reporters at the scene the dead were a Fijian-Indian family who moved to Australia several years ago.
Abhay Singh, the uncle of the children, said he was "absolutely shattered". "It's a real mystery, we just do not know what has happened," he told the Melbourne Age.
"They were a really lovely family, very reserved. It is shattering. I don't know how anyone can recover from that."
