ROME - AC Milan's Brazilian striker Pato will be out of action for the rest of the season, club doctor Jean-Pierre Meerssman revealed on Thursday.
The 22-year-old has suffered 14 injuries in the past two years, principally thigh muscle problems, but also to his ankles and groin, restricting him to just 11 league games this season, in which he has scored once.
"Ten days, or 20 or 30 (out) does little to change were we are now," Meerssman told Gazzetta dello sport. "And when he has recovered we'll be back to square one again. Pato was declared clinically recovered 13 times but he's obviously not cured."
Pato picked up the latest injury in Wednesday's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final, second leg loss in Barcelona, leaving the pitch 14 mitches after coming on.
"He's been all over the place from Germany to the United States, lots of doctors and therapists have examined and treated him, I don't know who to turn to next," added Meerssman.
Pato came close to signing in January for French side Paris Saint Germain in a 28-million-euro deal, but the move was blocked by the last minute intervention of club owner Silvio Berlusconi.
