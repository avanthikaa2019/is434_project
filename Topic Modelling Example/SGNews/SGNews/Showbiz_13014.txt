TERENGGANU's scenic landscape is luring filmmakers to the state, injecting opportunities for the tourism industry.
Already, several films have been shot in various locations around the state, including the award-winning movie Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa, filmed at the beaches of Setiu and Kuala Terengganu, Hanyut, which is directed by U-Wei Shaari and Bunohan.
Love You, You, a Hong Kong film, was shot on the pristine beaches of Lang Tengah, an island located between the state's two most popular islands -- Redang and Perhentian.
Its director, Jingle Ma, had previously filmed romantic comedy Summer Holiday on Pulau Redang and was reported to have said last year that he had always wanted to make another movie showcasing the pristine beaches of Malaysia.
Discovery Channel, too, had filmed a documentary on the Terrapuri Resort in Setiu for a feature on heritage in 2010.
Ping Anchorage director Alex Lee, a tour operator, said movie directors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Germany had also come to Terengganu to recce several sites recently.
"They told me the state, especially in Setiu, was very picturesque with fishing villages, sandy beaches, wetlands and coconut grooves.
"They said this is a very colourful state," he told the New Sunday Times yesterday.
Lee, who owns the Terrapuri, also revealed that a few Hong Kong stars had returned to Terengganu for vacations after completing their films.
With the interest shown by local and foreign filmmakers, Lee said this was an opportunity to boost the states's tourism industry.
The state government, he suggested could offer special incentives to directors whose films indirectly help to promote Terengganu.
Tax incentives offered in Australia led to The Matrix being filmed there.
"Hopefully, Hollywood will come a-calling," Lee said.
