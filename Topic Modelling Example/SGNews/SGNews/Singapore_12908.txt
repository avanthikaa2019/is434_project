Taxi driver Cheng Teck Hock, 52, was remembered as a caring father and uncle, who had a passion for karaoke singing.
He would take his children, nieces and nephews out for karaoke sessions, where he would sing songs of Hong Kong singer Andy Lau, said his elder son, Dao Han, 19, a second-year student at Anderson Junior College.
Yesterday, family and friends gathered at the void deck of Block 306 in Canberra Road at the wake of Mr Cheng, who died on Sunday.
He died from brain injuries sustained last Saturday, after a Ferrari sports car crashed into his ComfortDelGro taxi.
Mr Cheng left behind his wife and three children, for whom his monthly earnings of $1,700 was their sole income.
But financial affairs have taken a back seat for now as his family wanted to focus on giving him a proper send-off.
"Currently, we are not really thinking about our finances," said Mr Cheng Dao Han.
Meanwhile, support from members of the public has poured in, through calls and text messages to the family.
Ms Stella Tan, 23, a niece of Mr Cheng Teck Hock, thanked them, many of whom wanted to donate money to ease their financial burden.
To donate, readers can make cheques payable to "LIM CHOO ENG" and mail them to The Cheng Family, c/o Comfort Transportation Pte Ltd, 383 Sin Ming Drive, Singapore 575717, Attn: Customer Service Centre, by the end of this month.
