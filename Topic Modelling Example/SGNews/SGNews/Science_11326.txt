Engineers at Intel Corp are applying lessons from aircraft design to create sturdier laptops in a bid to reduce the prices of the new ultra-thin computers the chipmaker is promoting.

Models expected later this year will have large touchscreens, "instant on" responsiveness and razor-thin dimensions.
