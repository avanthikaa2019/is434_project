The Malaysian Court postponed a verdict on the extradition of Bangkok bomb suspect Masoud Sedaghatzadeh from yesterday until May 28, police spokesman Pol MajGeneral Piya Uthayo said.
Piya confirmed the procedure would be according to the extradition treaty between the UK and the Kingdom of Thailand drawn up during the reign of King Rama V1.
Sedaghatzadeh was arrested at Kuala Lumpur airport after three bombs exploded on February 14 in Bangkok but extradition was challenged on the grounds Thailand and Malaysia had no formal treaty.
Sedaghatzadeh's extradition has been requested by Thailand, India and Georgia, as he was suspected being involved in bomb attacks affecting all three countries.
