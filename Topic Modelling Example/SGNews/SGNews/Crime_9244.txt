SUBANG JAYA - She recently escaped a jail sentence, but the 28-year-old accountant whose crossbred dog mauled and killed an elderly man will have yet another day in court. Elaine Soon Sien Ling will be charged under Section 15 (1) of the Subang Jaya Municipal Council's Licensing of Dogs and Kennel Establishment by-law 2007 at the magistrate's court here.
The by-law covers attacks by licensed dogs. If guilty, she faces a RM2,000 fine or a year's jail, or both.
On Monday, Soon, who was charged at the court under Section 289 of the Penal Code with being negligent with her pet, was fined RM2,000 (S$800).
However, she escaped a jail sentence after the court heard that the victim's family had forgiven her.
The fate of Beacon, her dog, remained unknown as no court order had yet been issued.
Investigating officer Assistant Superintendent Kwek Chuwen Hui said the order on the dog's fate was expected to be sent to the deputy public prosecutor who will in turn instruct the Veterinary Services Department.
Selangor Veterinary Services Department deputy director Dr Fadzilah A'ini Abd Kadir had reportedly said the dog would either be put to sleep, given up to the police to be trained into a police dog or returned to the owner.
The dog was reported to be free of rabies.
On May 8, Beacon attacked and killed Yip Sun Wah, 74, as he was jogging in front of a house in SS19, Subang Jaya 8.
The Subang Jaya Municipal Council, along with other local councils in Selangor, attended a workshop to review, redraft and repeal the Licensing of Dogs and Kennel Establishments by-law.
The workshop discussed heavier penalties, control and listing of restricted and banned breeds, as well as mulling the option of micro-chipping animals.
Subang Jaya Municipal Council legal adviser Anita Abd Jalil said the aim of the meeting was to standardise the rules, regulations and penalties concerning pets.
"The councils will send their recommendations to the state in two months," she said.
