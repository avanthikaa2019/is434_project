BEIJING - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton left Beijing on Saturday after tumultuous negotiations with China over the blind rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who plans to travel to the United States under a deal to end the standoff.
Clinton's aircraft left at about 2pm (0600 GMT), according a Reuters reporter at the Beijing airport, while the 40-year-old Chen remains as planned in a Beijing hospital after escaping from 19 months under house arrest.
Beijing indicated on Friday that Chen will be allowed to go to the US to study.
