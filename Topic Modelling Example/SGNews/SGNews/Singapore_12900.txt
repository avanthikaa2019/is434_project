Sin Chew Daily reported that a 22-year-old Singaporean woman has undergone surgery to reduce the size of her breasts from G-cup to C-cup.
As the woman only weighed 48kg, the giant breasts made her stand out and caused much discomfort.
She had always received unnecessary attention from people.
The woman was ashamed of her huge assets and sought help from plastic surgery expert Dr J.J. Chua, who confirmed she was suffering from hypertrophy of the breast (macromastia). Dr Chua performed breast reduction surgery on her.
Macromastia is defined as an abnormal largeness of the breasts. The condition is a rare disease believed to be caused be a heightened sensitivity to female hormones such as estrogen and progesteron. It causes the patient to have heavy breasts that sag, leading to an array of health problems such as chronic neck and back pain, poor blood circulation and difficulties in breathing.
