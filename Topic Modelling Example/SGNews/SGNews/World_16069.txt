ISTANBUL - Neslisah Sultan, the oldest member of the dynasty that ruled the former Ottoman empire, has died at the age of 91, Turkish media reported Tuesday.
The granddaughter of the last Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, died on Monday and will be buried in the former Ottoman capital later Tuesday after a religious ceremony.
She was the last member of the Ottoman dynasty to be born before the empire was disbanded in 1922 in the wake of World War I and modern Turkey created in its place by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
After the death in 2009 of Ertugrul Osman Osmanoglu, the last pretender to the Ottoman throne, she took the title of "oldest member of the Osmanogullari family", the Ottoman dynasty.
The royal family was forced into exile in 1924 and female members were only allowed to return in the 1950s. Males remained barred from the country until 1974.
