KLANG, Malaysia - Two babies, aged 22 days and three months respectively, were saved from a baby-for-sale syndicate at a popular shopping mall here Friday.
Police also arrested four women, including a 37-year-old Singaporean believed to be the middleman for the baby-for-sale activity.
South Klang OCPD Asst Comm Mohamad Mat Yusop said police surveillance led them to a cafe at the mall, where the Singaporean was spotted with three other local women.
"Many photos of babies were found on the Singaporean's mobile phone, more than 10. And there were messages indicating transactions took place," he said.
ACP Mohamad added that the local women were believed to be the nannies of the babies.
The 22-day-old baby was found with his birth certificate and passport, while the other baby, also a boy, had no documentation.
The younger baby is of Chinese-Indian parentage, and his passport was issued only two weeks ago on March 19, said ACP Mohamad.
"We have traced his parents and called them in to record their statement," he said.
It is believed that the babies were sold by their parents to the middleman, and not abducted, he added.
The case is being investigated under Section 14 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act.
The babies were sent to the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital for a DNA test and medical check-up, and handed over to the Welfare Department.
