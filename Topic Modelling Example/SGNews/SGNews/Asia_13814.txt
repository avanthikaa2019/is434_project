MAEBASHI, JAPAN - The driver of the bus that crashed on the Kanetsu Expressway, killing seven people, said he was asleep at the time of the crash and that he did not know the names of interchanges and service areas, according to police.
Kazan Kono, 43, of Chiba, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of causing death and injury through negligent driving. The Gunma prefectural police are investigating his actions and other causes that may have led to his drowsiness.
The bus crashed into a noise-blocking wall near the Fujioka junction in Gunma Prefecture early Sunday, killing seven people and injuring 39, including Kono.
According to senior prefectural police officials, Kono explained that before the accident, the bus left JR Kanazawa Station and headed for Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, on surface roads.
After picking up several passengers at JR Takaoka Station, Kono reportedly said he had entered an expressway via the interchange closest to the station.
While Kono drove about 6-1/2 hours until he crashed into the wall, he explained that he had taken three 15-minute breaks, the officials said.
"At first, I entered the service area closest to Takaoka," Kono was quoted as saying. "I didn't know the names" of the interchanges or service areas, he was quoted as saying.
Although Kono is from China, his Japanese is good enough for daily conversation. The police suspect Kono traveled an unfamiliar route while relying on a navigation system
