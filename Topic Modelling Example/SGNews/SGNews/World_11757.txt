ISLAMABAD - Pakistan said Tuesday it had successfully test fired a short-range nuclear-capable ballistic missile.
The Hatf IX has a range of only 60 kilometres (37 miles) and can carry conventional warheads, the military said.
"This quick response system addresses the need to deter evolving threats, specially at shorter ranges," it added in a statement.
It was the third time Pakistan has test fired a ballistic missile since arch-rival India last month launched its new long-range Agni V, capable of hitting targets anywhere in China.
India and Pakistan - which have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 - have routinely carried out missile tests since both demonstrated nuclear weapons capability in 1998.
Defence analysts say India's strategic priorities are moving away from Pakistan to focus more on China, while Pakistan is still concerned about its eastern neighbour.
