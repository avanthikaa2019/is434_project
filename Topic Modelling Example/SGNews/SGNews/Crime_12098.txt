A 25-year-old Malaysian woman has been jailed for 18 years for drug trafficking.
Roshamima Rosian escaped the death sentence after her conviction for drug trafficking was overturned on appeal.
On Thursday, the court said that Roshamima was more culpable than her boyfriend, who was also her accomplice. Hence, she was punished more severely.
She and heer 28-year-old fiance, Mas Swan Adnan had driven into Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint on the night of May 6, 2009.
It was there that authorities found three bundles wrapped in tape in the car's front left door panel.
The bundles contained 21.48g of heroin. Anyone convicted of trafficking more than 15g of the drug receives the death penalty.
The couple were subsequently arrested and tried in the High Court.
Mas Swan was acquitted of the capital charge on the grounds that he believed Roshamima when she informed him that the bundles held Ecstasy pills.
He was sentenced to 15 years jail and eight strokes of the cane.
Roshamima was sent to the gallows. However, she appealed against her conviction and the Court of Appeal decided to overturn it.
They found her guilty of attempting to import Ecstasy instead.
The maximum punishment for importing Ecstasy is life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
