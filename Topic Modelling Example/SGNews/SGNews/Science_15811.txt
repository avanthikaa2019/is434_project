SAN FRANCISCO - Google on Wednesday gave the world a glimpse of its vision for letting people look at life through Internet-tinted glasses.
A video posted at a Project Glass page at Google+ social network confirmed the rumour that the technology titan is working on eyewear that meshes the online world with the real world.
'We think technology should work for you - be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don't,' members of the project team said in a Google+ post.
'A group of us from Google X (Labs) started Project Glass to build this kind of technology; one that helps you explore and share your world.' Images showed people wearing eyeglasses with stylish silver frames that featured tiny cameras and on-lens displays to discretely show information such as walking directions, weather forecasts or messages from friends.
Built-in microphones let wearers command the Internet-linked glasses by speaking.
'We took a few design photos to show what this technology could look like and created a video to demonstrate what it might enable you to do,' Google said, stressing that the glasses were a concept far from being brought to market.
'We're sharing this information now because we want to start a conversation and learn from your valuable input.' The project team invited people to express ideas for the glasses at the Google+ page.
Google co-founder Sergey Brin is deeply involved with the California company's X Labs, best known for its work on a self-driving car.
A YouTube video of legally blind Steve Mahan 'driving' an autonomous Google car in his California neighborhood has been viewed more than 1.2 million times since it was uploaded on March 27.
