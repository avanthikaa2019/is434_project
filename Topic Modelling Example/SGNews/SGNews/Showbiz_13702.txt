Actress Fasha Sandha, who was just married last week, says it's good feeling to be next to someone and to have someone to share her life with and also&hellip; someone to cook for.
Fasha, 28, married 36-year-old businessman Rizal Ashram Ramli (Jejai) recently.
"Ikan Tenggiri was our first meal as a married couple. I cooked it and he asked for it again and again," she laughs.
She knows that the best way to a man's heart is to his stomach.
Culinary tastes aside, she also feels that Jejai is her soul mate.
"I can speak to him about anything. I learn something new everyday. I'm always learning how to be a better wife," she says.
She's taking a couple of weeks off her busy schedule for a honeymoon in Pulau Redang to soak up some sun and have a bit of a swim.
She would not comment on her marriage not getting the blessings of the in-laws as the mother-in-law was not present at the ceremony.
"What's important is I'm married and I'm grateful that I have a good man," she says.
Fasha can be seen on TV3's drama Seindah Sakura.
