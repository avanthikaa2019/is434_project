PETALING JAYA, Malaysia = Police have crippled a syndicate which specialised in stealing four-wheel drives before shipping them off to Singapore and Bangkok.
The syndicate's activities for the past three months came to an end when police arrested five of its members in Kampung Baru Subang last Thursday.
The group was seen driving a Toyota Hilux out from a factory, located about 1km away from Kampung Subang Baru police station at about 8.45pm.
Selangor police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Tun Hisan Tun Hamzah said that following the arrest, police raided a factory where they found two containers.
He said police were shocked to find three four-wheel drives, which were all reported stolen, in each container.
"We seized five Toyota Hilux and two Toyota Fortuners," he said here yesterday.
Police discovered that the syndicate had shipped off a container with three four-wheel drives to Singapore on May 21.
Initial investigations revealed that the three vehicles were reported stolen in Kuala Lumpur, Damansara and Bukit Puchong this month.
However, the container was seized by Singapore authorities on Sunday.
DCP Tun Hisan said records showed the syndicate had shipped 54 vehicles using 18 containers to Singapore and Bangkok since March this year.
"We believe the syndicate had stolen 64 four-wheel drives worth some RM10mil (S$4 million)," he added.
Police had identified a forwarding agent involved in shipping the containers who declared the shipment as baby diapers.
Thirteen of the containers were shipped through North Port while the rest left via West Port in Port Klang.
The syndicate does not keep stolen vehicles for long and would order a container once they have stock in the factory.
DCP Tun Hisan said the police were in the midst of identifying the owner of the former furniture factory used by the syndicate to store the stolen vehicles.
All five suspects, aged between 21 and 42 tested positive for drugs, and have been remanded to facilitate investigations.
