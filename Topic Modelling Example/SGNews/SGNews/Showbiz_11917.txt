Being J. Lo's toy boy sure has its perks.
Back-up dancer Casper Smart, 25, who publicly hooked up with Jennifer Lopez, 42, in November last year, is now set to star with the US singer-actress in a new reality show on TV network Oxygen.
This comes after Lopez promoted him to choreographer on her upcoming world tour.
A source told the New York Post that it will showcase Smart and Lopez's "professional relationship" as he gets her dancers in shape for the tour with Latin pop star Enrique Iglesias this year.
Oh enough with the lovefest already.
