SINGAPORE - Stage actress Emma Yong, who breathed her last before midnight on Wednesday, will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium tomorrow afternoon.
my paper made numerous attempts to contact her family members yesterday but they declined to be interviewed, saying they preferred to keep things private.
She was diagnosed with stage- four stomach cancer in January last year, and fought it into remission after undergoing chemotherapy. But she suffered a relapse at the end of last year.
The 36-year-old was best known for being one third of cabaret act Dim Sum Dollies and starred in productions such as Little Shop Of Horrors (2006) and Into The Woods (2011).
"She was a delight, a wonderful and great talent," said Glen Goei, 49, who directed Dim Sum Dollies. Goei was a close friend and had introduced her to her interior designer-husband Jerry Lim, 32.
Nominated Member of Parliament and actress Janice Koh first met Yong in 1994 on the production of A Night Out. In an e-mail reply to my paper, Ms Koh said that "her passing is a devastating loss to the theatre family and the arts community".
