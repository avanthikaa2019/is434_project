LONDON - An investigation was underway Friday after a Chinese student died having been knocked down by an unmarked British police car.
The 24-year-old, who has not been named, died in hospital Thursday after sustaining serious head and back injuries when he was struck in Birmingham, Britain's second city.
While crossing a road, he was hit by a car responding to reports of a stolen vehicle, though the vehicle was not in pursuit, West Midlands Police said.
The car was being driven by a uniformed officer who has since been suspended from driving police vehicles.
The victim was studying for a masters science degree in data networks and security at Birmingham City University.
Police said his family had been informed and his parents were flying from China to Britain, where they will be met by police officers.
&ldquo;This was a tragic incident in which a young man has lost his life after being struck by an unmarked police car as he crossed the road,&rdquo; said Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe.
&ldquo;A comprehensive investigation has been launched to establish the precise circumstances of the collision.&rdquo;
