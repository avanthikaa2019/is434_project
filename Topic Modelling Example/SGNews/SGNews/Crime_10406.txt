PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Four robbers took less than three minutes to cart away an automatic teller machine containing RM47,900 (S$19,610) from the Subang Jaya KTM commuter station.
In the 3.50am incident yesterday, the robbers tied a cable around the ATM before pulling it out using a heavy vehicle.
Subang Jaya Deputy OCPD Supt Tan Ah Chua said the four robbers, believed to be in their 30's, wore hats and hand towels to cover their faces.
He added that the robbers sprayed the CCTV placed near the ATM with black paint before carrying out the act.
"However, the cameras managed to capture their images," he said, adding that police are studying the footage.
Supt Tan said police were alerted about the incident at 6.30am when a bank officer saw the missing ATM when he came by to carry out some upgrade work at the machine.
It is learnt there were no security guard on duty at that time.
"We are investigating all possible angles, including whether the perpetrators were the same gang that had hit other ATM machines in other districts early this month and last month," he added.
On June 1, thieves carted away an ATM machine which contained RM37,520 when they dragged it out of a building in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi near Sepang.
On May 26, an ATM machine at the Universti LRT station was broken into and thieves escaped with RM61,000.
