LinkedIn has been hit with a US$5-million (S$6.3-million) class-action lawsuit brought by a user in the United States.
The suit comes after a security breach on June 6, when encrypted passwords of some 6.5 million of LinkedIn's 160 million users were stolen and posted on the Web.
The suit said the business oriented social-networking site "violated its own user agreement and privacy policy", said technology-news website Digital Trends.
