SINGAPORE - A woman has pleaded guilty to stabbing her female lover's boyfriend in a fit of rage, The Straits Times (ST) reported.
The court heard that Mr Kelly Ong Bi Hao, 27, had gone to the Bedok apartment of Ms Lin Pei Ying, 27, on the morning of Jan 1, 2012 to have breakfast together.
The accused, Teo Ming Min, 29, then arrived at the apartment and was let in by Ms Lin's sister, who was just leaving the house.
Teo had been in a relationship with Ms Lin for about three years.
Mr Ong was in the bedroom of Ms Lin, and came out. Upon seeing him leaving her room, Teo questioned Ms Lin about her boyfriend.
Mr Ong retreated to the toilet while the Ms Lin explained the situation, which escalated to Teo becoming agitated and stabbing Mr Ong repeatedly when he came out of the toilet.
The graphic designer stabbed Mr Ong twice in the chest and once in his back.
It has been confirmed by an Institute of Mental Health doctor that Teo is suffering from anxiety and depression and these contributed to the attack.
She is currently receiving medical treatment and counselling. Her sentencing is awaiting a pre-sentence report to be delivered on July 24.
