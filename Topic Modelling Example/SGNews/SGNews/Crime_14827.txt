JOHOR BARU - A 70-year-old housewife lost more than RM65,000 (S$26,500) to a woman known as Master Kho who convinced her that her house was haunted by a spirit.
Kho approached Chia Wee Yee at a shop near her house in Jalan Lembah, Taman Desa Jaya, on April 17 and told her the spirit was dangerous and could threaten her family's safety.
Chia was further convinced when two other women claimed Kho was an expert in dealing with spirits.
Afraid that bad luck might befall her family, Chia agreed for Kho to chase away the spirit and was told to bring along all her money and valuables wrapped in newspaper for the ritual.
Chia did as instructed and packed up A$6,000 (S$7800), S$6,000 and RM7,000 as well as RM25,000 worth of gold bangles, chains, earrings and jade rings.
Chia's daughter Tracy Tee, 37, said she thought her mother was wrapping up the valuables for safekeeping.
"When I saw her leaving the house carrying a recycling bag at 9.30am, my mother said she was going to the temple for prayers," Tee told a press conference organised by Johor DAP Youth Chief Tan Hong Pin here yesterday.
Chia, who was also at the press conference, appeared dazed and was not able to speak properly.
Tee said she confronted Chia when her mother acted strangely upon returning home in the afternoon.
"She told me the whole story. We checked the recycling bag and were shocked to find five oranges and two bottles of mineral water," said Tee.
Meanwhile, Seri Alam OCPD Supt Roslan Zainuddin said the public must be wary when approached by mediums and other suspicious characters.
