BAGHDAD - Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has begun posting Internet advertisements offering training for suicide bombers to target the United States, Israel and France, adverts on several jihadist web forums show.
The advertisements ask for volunteers to get in touch via e-mail with details about their own experience and proposed targets, and were posted on a variety of jihadist forums, including Al-Fidaa, Shmoukh al-Islam and Honein.
'The aim of this training is to continue with our brothers who are seeking to carry out operations that make for great killing and slaughtering of the enemies of Islam,' said the advertisement attributed to Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
'It is clear now that the individual jihad, or what is called the lone wolf, has become more widespread and its features have started showing - in summary, it is a complete jihadist operation to be carried out by a single bomber.'
It said the targets of the attacks were 'those who are fighting the Muslims and Islam' and specifically pointed to 'economic, military and media interests of the enemy.'
'Their identity must be, according to priority, American, Israeli, French and British.'
Al-Qaeda and its regional offshoots often use jihadist Internet forums to post statements claiming responsibility for attacks, and to communicate with followers.
