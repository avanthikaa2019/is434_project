Korean actors Lee Byung-hun and Ahn Sung-ki became the first Korean actors to leave handprints and footprints in the forecourt of an iconic Hollywood theatre.
The two stars left imprints of their hands and feet outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California, on Saturday as part of events held during the "Looking East 2012 Korean Movie Festival" from Saturday to Sunday.
Ten Korean films including "Unbowed," "Poetry," and "Thirst," were screened during the two-day festival. "I can't believe I just got my handprints here. It's an incredible moment because I used to take pictures in front of the handprints of Hollywood actors and actresses," said Lee at the ceremony.
Lee appeared in the Hollywood blockbuster movie "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra" in 2009.
"It's been a tremendous honour to leave my handprints and footprints here with other big stars," said Ahn Sung-ki, one of the most respected and popular actors in Korea.
Ahn played a leading role in the Korean courtroom drama "Unbowed" released earlier this year.
Lee and Ahn join a long list of Hollywood stars to have participated in the same event since the ceremony started in 1927.
The stars honoured with handprints include Elizabeth Taylor, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise.
Hong Kong movie director John Woo was the first Asian to have left his prints in Hollywood in 2002.
