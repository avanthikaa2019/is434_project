A 30-year-old security officer was jailed yesterday for four weeks after filming his 13-year-old then-stepdaughter changing her clothes.
The man, who cannot be named to protect the girl's identity, pleaded guilty to one count of insulting her modesty.
The court heard that this perverse act cost him his nine-year marriage to the girl's mother.
The couple were divorced last year, said his lawyer, Mr Barry Delaney.
The man is now engaged to another woman, who was present in court yesterday.
The plump, tan-complexioned woman declined to comment when The New Paper approached her.
Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Michelle Lu said that on on May 13, 2010, the girl had returned home from school at around 4pm .
Later, when she came out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, she noticed the man sitting in the living room before a computer.
DPP Lu told District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam that the girl went to her room and locked the door to put on her clothes.
The tall, well-built man used a mobile phone to film her changing through a window.
She spotted him and immediately went to her mother's room to change.
After that, she left the flat and alerted the police.
For insulting the girl's modesty, the man could have been jailed up to a year and fined.
