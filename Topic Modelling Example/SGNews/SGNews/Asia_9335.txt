A 62-year old civil defense officer (locally known as hansip), Suripno, received an award on Wednesday from the Jakarta Police for his heroic role in helping officers to pursue and arrest drug dealers earlier this month in Sawah Besar, Central Jakarta.
In the pursuit, one of the drug dealers shot Suripno in his right shoulder.
"I have been a hansip for almost 25 years, yet it is only now that I feel appreciated," Suripno said after receiving an award at the Jakarta Police headquarters.
Besides Suripno, Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Untung S Radjab also presented awards to 127 officers from police stations across Greater Jakarta for their relentless efforts in solving major cases throughout the city.
"For their achievements, these officers will receive promotions as of July 1," Untung said before hundreds of officers gathered at the morning assembly, held at the grounds in front of the Jakarta Police headquarters.
Those receiving awards included officers from the Jakarta Police's General Crimes Directorate, who had reportedly arrested the perpetrators of a rash of armed robberies that for the last few months had plagued the city.
Officers reigned in the perpetrators of at least 15 armed robberies in Greater Jakarta since the beginning of this year, including those believed responsible for this month's robberies of three men, including an Indian national.
They also apprehended a group of armed robbers suspected of killing Djuli Elfano, a senior reporter at state-owned television station TVRI, in March.
