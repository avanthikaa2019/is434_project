Short of cash to pay the pizza delivery man? No worries in the future, as Nets tests out a new device that allows for PIN debit payments on the go.
The iSMP mobile terminal, developed by payment services provider Ingenico, works as a sleeve for the merchant's iPhone and allows it to be used as a mobile Nets payment terminal, reported Channel NewsAsia.
The device, which is being tested for launch later this year, was introduced at a media briefing yesterday, ahead of the Cards &amp; Payments Asia 2012 trade show, at Suntec Singapore convention centre.
