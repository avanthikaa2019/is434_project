SINGAPORE - Minister for Education Heng Swee Keat on Thursday announced the launch of a new professional development model, the Teacher Growth Model (TGM).
Moving away from a largely centralised system, he revealed that the new model aims to develop teachers holistically and encourages teachers to take ownership of their growth.
Mr Heng was speaking to more than 2,000 teachers at a two-day Teachers' Conference held at Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre. It is the sixth year of the annual seminar is being conducted.
He acknowledged that "a one size fits all system will not work well" for the 32,000 educators that Singapore has under the Ministry of Education.
He said teachers should move away from their shortcomings, and focus on building their interest and strengths.
Under the development model, teachers may chart their growth through five areas: the ethical educator, the competent professional, the collaborative learner, the transformational leader and the community builder.
Teachers will have the flexibility and autonomy to learn according to their needs and interest, according to The Straits Times.
