NEW YORK - Maurice Sendak, the author who introduced millions of children worldwide to mischievous Max and his monsters in "Where The Wild Things Are," died Tuesday, his publisher said. He was 83.
"He died on Tuesday in Danbury, Connecticut. The cause was complication from a recent stroke," Erin Crum, at HarperCollins in New York, told AFP.
Critics say it is impossible to imagine children's literature without Sendak, whose whimsical works penned throughout a 60-year career have been read by millions and translated into dozens of languages.
Although the 1963 "Where The Wild Things Are" is the best known, he penned and illustrated nearly 50 books, including the acclaimed "Little Bear" series.
Memorable works include "Pierre" about a mischievous, quarrelsome child whose constant refrain throughout the book is "I don't care!"
Other perennial favorites are "Really Rosie," "In the Night Kitchen," and "Outside Over There."
He won the prestigious Caldecott prize for children's literature, the Newbery medal, the international Hans Christian Andersen Award, a National Book Award, the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award and a National Medal of Arts.
President Barack Obama read "Where the Wild Things Are" to children at the annual White House Easter egg roll on April 9, mimicking the monsters in a loud voice.
