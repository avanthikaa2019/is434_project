A 19-year-old National Serviceman, Toh Poh Leung, was yesterday charged with voluntarily causing hurt to a 20-year-old man.
On Oct 10, 2010, at 5am outside McDonald's at HarbourFront Centre, Toh allegedly punched Mr Ng Guang Long on the nose, causing a fracture of the nasal bone.
Just three days earlier, Toh had allegedly punched Mr Ng on the head at the dance floor of St James Powerhouse.
For the first charge of grievous hurt, he faces up to 10 years' jail, and is liable to fine or caning.
The second charge carries a jail term of up to two years, or with a fine of up to $5,000, or both.
