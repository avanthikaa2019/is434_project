The plight of cancer sufferers often affects the family and friends who care for them, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Vivian Balakrishnan said yesterday.
"Cancer is something that affects many of us," he said. "As a doctor, I used to focus mostly on the medical aspect.
"However, beyond the medical perspective, there is also financial and emotion strain on the (sufferers), as well as their family and friends."
Dr Balakrishnan was speaking at the 2XU Compression Run along Nicoll Highway, where runners were flagged off at 7am.
Some 10,000 runners participated in four categories of 10km and 15km runs.
Event-management company Pink Apple organised the run and presented a cheque for $20,000 to Singapore Cancer Society (SCS).
The funds were raised through registration fees for the event. It is the first time SCS has been the run's beneficiary in its three-year history.
The event also marked the launch of this year's Daffodil Days - a month-long global programme to raise funds for and awareness of the fight against cancer.
Dr Balakrishnan said: "Daffodil Days also focuses on the caregivers, and this run makes what we are doing more real."
As part of Daffodil Days this month, SCS will raise funds for its many programmes and services provided to needy cancer patients.
