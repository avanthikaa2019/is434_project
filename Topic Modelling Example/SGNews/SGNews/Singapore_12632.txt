BUCHAREST - The next hearing in the trial of Silviu Ionescu, the former Romanian Charge d'Affaires in Singapore, will take place later today.
Singapore's Special Envoy to Romania, Ambassador Ong Eng Chuan will attend the hearing. A representative from the Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore will accompany Mr Ong.
The trial involves witnesses giving evidence via video link from a courtroom in the Subordinate Courts in Singapore.
Ionescu was involved in a local hit-and-run accident in December 2009 which left one dead and two injured.
One of the victims, Mr Bong Hwee Haw, has since developed epilepsy due to complications from his head injuries. Mr Bong now suffers from seizures that prevent him from working.
Ionescu denies responsibility and reported the car stolen. The black Audi A6 was later found abandoned in an industrial estate.
Ionsecu could face up to seven years in jail in Bucharest for manslaughter if convicted.
