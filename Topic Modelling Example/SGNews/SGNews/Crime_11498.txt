A total of 34 people were arrested by the police yesterday in an islandwide operation for their suspected involvement in loansharking activities.
The 14-hour operation, conducted between 8am to 10pm on May 31, netted a total of 24 men and 10 women, aged between 26 and 72. Over 30 officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division conducted simultaneous raids at various locations including Ang Mo Kio, Yishun, Toa Payoh, Telok Blangah, Bukit Merah, Owen Rd and Kembangan.
Preliminary investigations show that the suspects had opened bank accounts and given away their Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) to loansharking syndicates to facilitate unlicensed moneylending businesses.
In a statement, the police said that all the suspects, who are believed to be either borrowers or guarantors, had assisted the loansharks either for monetary gains or to offset their debts.
Investigations against all the suspects are still on-going.
Under the Moneylenders' Act (Revised Edition 2010), when a bank account or ATM card of any person is used to facilitate moneylending by an unlicensed moneylender, that person is presumed to have assisted in the carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending.
First-time offenders found guilty of assisting in the business of unlicensed moneylending may be fined not less than $30,000 and not more $300,000, be imprisoned for a term not exceeding four years and shall also be liable to be punished with caning of not more than six strokes.
