Three men, aged 27 and 51, have been arrested for suspected involvement in two separate cases of loansharking activities.
Police officers arrested the 51-year-old man at a shopping centre in Jurong on April 10 at about 5pm.
Preliminary investigations revealed that he is a debtor-turned-runner and had assisted loanshark syndicates by handing over monies to debtor to facilitate the opening of bank accounts, obtaining ATM cards from debtors, as well as verifying the particulars of potential customers before loans were issued to them.
Upon his arrest, $500 cash, 16 ATM cards and a mobile phone were seized.
The second arrest was made the next day at about 5.20am when police officers were conducting a roadblock along Yishun Ave 6.
They stopped a vehicle carrying the two suspects, who are both aged 27.
The officers observed that the two men appeared suspicious and conducted a check on them.
Loanshark-related paraphernalia comprising cans of paint, marker pens, gloves, paint remover, plastic bags, handphones and an iPad containing debtors' records were found in their possession and were seized.
Preliminary investigation reveal that the two suspects are believed to have carried out loanshark harassment in Yishun, Pasir Ris, Bedok and Clementi by splashing paint at debtors' units and scrawling loanshark-related graffiti on the walls.
All three suspects will be charged in court on April 12.
The 51-year-old suspect will be charged for assisting unlicensed moneylenders. If found guilty, he may be fined between $30,000 and $300,000, face a maximum jail term of four years, and a maximum of six strokes of the cane.
