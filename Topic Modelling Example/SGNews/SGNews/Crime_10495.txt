Police have released samples of handwriting by Katsuya Takahashi as they keep up the hunt for the last Aum Supreme Truth cult member wanted over the 1995 sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway system.
The Metropolitan Police Department released a withdrawal form Takahashi filled in this month at a bank in Kawasaki, and the resume he submitted to a construction company he worked for in the city.
His way of writing the numeral "9" is quite distinctive.
According to the MPD, Takahashi withdrew 2.38 million yen shortly after noon on June 4 in three installments of 900,000 yen, 900,000 yen and 580,000 yen.
He had to access the money this way because there is a limit on withdrawals at the local shinkin bank in Kawasaki Ward. Takahashi wrote the date, amount of money he wanted and his assumed name of "Shinya Sakurai" on the withdrawal form. He also affixed his personal seal.
Footage taken by security cameras and other sources confirmed Takahashi is right-handed.
