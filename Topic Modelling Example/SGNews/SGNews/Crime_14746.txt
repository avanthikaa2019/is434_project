JOHOR BARU - Police have recorded a 10 per cent increase in drug trafficking and drug abuse cases in the state this year, Federal Narcotics Crimes Investigation Department director Comm Datuk Noor Rashid Ibrahim said.
He said police had arrested a total of 3,749 people for drug trafficking and drug possession and 2,847 drug abusers between January and April 18 in Johor this year.
"Our investigations revealed that most of the drugs smuggled into the state were brought in by female drug mules employed by local syndicates and those from Iran and Nigeria," he said.
Speaking to reporters after attending a policing walkabout at Giant Hypermarket in Plentong here yesterday, he said there are some syndicates which smuggled in raw materials and concoct their own drugs in mini drug labs throughout the country, especially in the northern states.
"Police have also noticed that many of the syndicates are now using luxury homes and farms to set up drug labs," he said, adding that it was vital for the public to cooperate with the police especially when they noticed such suspicious activities.
Comm Noor Rashid said police were going all out to locate and eliminate such syndicates as they were the root of criminal activities in the country.
During the walkabout session along with Johor Police Chief Deputy Comm Datuk Mohd Mokhtar Mohd Shariff, they met with members of the public and handed out booklets with phone numbers of all the police stations and community policing in the Seri Alam area.
"We also stuck stickers with the police hotline at shops' entrance so the public are more aware about ways to reach the police," he said.
