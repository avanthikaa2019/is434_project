After becoming an animal and environmental activist, Lee Hyo-ri is making another foray outside music ? writing columns for a movie magazine.
Weekly film magazine CINE 21 announced Lee would start writing for the publication this month. Her first column will appear in May's first issue, said Doo Hwa-jin of the publication.
"In addition to her singing and entertainment career, Lee has been vocal about various issues," Doo told The Korea Herald when asked why they hired Lee.
"She's been active in raising awareness about saving the environment and about animal rights. We thought she'd have a lot to share through her upcoming columns."
Lee will be contributing a piece once every four weeks to a section titled "From Dystopia," according to the magazine. Other contributing writers for the section include the recent box office hit "Love Fiction" director Jeon Gye-soo, popular magazine writer Kim Gyeong, literary critic Shin Hyeong-cheol and movie producer Won Dong-yeon.
The singer's columns will touch on various themes and issues, including the heyday of Korea's entertainment industry in the 1990s, as well as the recent labor strikes at Korea's major broadcasters.
Lee, who made her debut as a member of girl group Fin.K.L. in 1998, has been a solo artist since 2002. She has won a number of awards throughout her solo career, including the grand prize at the 2009 SBS Entertainment Awards and the best pop artist prize at the 1st Seoul Arts and Culture Awards in 2010.
She has been involved with animal rights and environmental activism since 2010. Last year, she famously interviewed renowned British anthropologist and animal activist Jane Goodall in Seattle about animal welfare and rights, for a local fashion and life magazine, Singles.
