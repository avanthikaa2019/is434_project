TOKYO - An employee showed Panasonic's newly developed 'plant factory' in Tokyo on Thursday.
The 60cm-tall box is used for growing vegetables at home.
The box has a watering system, and white and red LED lights to stimulate photosynthesis.
Panasonic said on Monday that it will start field tests in Chiba prefecture with the help of Chiba University.
