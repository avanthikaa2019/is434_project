She cropped her hair short to show her solidarity with the cancer awareness campaign organised by the National Cancer Council of Malaysia.
But Ras Adiba Mohd Radzi, a popular Malaysian news anchor and TV personality, has alleged that a local TV station has "suspended" her of because of her new look.
She cut her hair last Friday, pledging to raise RM50,000(S$20,000) in donations to charity.
Ras Adiba, who freelances for NTV 7, alleged that the station told her she cannot appear on air until her hair grows back to an acceptable length, The Star reported.
A source from NTV 7 told The Star that she had approached them before getting shorn, and the management had told her from the start that if her hair was cropped, she would not be allowed to announce the news.
She was also told that she could resume her part-time position as newscaster once her hair had grown.
"We can't put a bald person on air, especially for news and (when) the anchor is a woman. We have to upkeep a certain look and feel," the source was quoted as saying.
"Ras suggested a wig, which we were against (as) it would look strange for her to appear on air in a wig and then in public with a shaved head."
The source also added that the station's managementfully supported her cause and had left the decision to her.
Ras Adiba explained that she cropped her hair as a sign of solidarity with cancer patients, having members of her own family who had been afflicted with the disease.
She told The Star: "My late stepfather died of cancer, my uncle is a cancer survivor. I have many friends going through it..."
She has now taken to wearing a turban, as she finds it comfortable.
