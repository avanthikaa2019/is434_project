Former president Megawati Soekarnoputri has assured workers that her party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), will support them in their aspirations.
The PDI-P chairwoman was quoted by Antara news agency as saying that workers' demands for higher wages were "fair, especially in times like these".
"Our party has members in the House of Representatives. We will help realize your ambitions through better laws," Megawati said on Thursday.
Her party, she added, fought for all people, not just workers.
"Our Constitution mandates that all Indonesians have the same rights to welfare and protection from the state," she said.
At the same time, Megawati also asked for workers to be realistic.
She said that workers had to demonstrate that they could work better and that they should voice their complaints peacefully.
