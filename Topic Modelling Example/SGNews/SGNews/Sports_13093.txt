PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Florida - Tiger Woods birdied four holes in a row on his way to firing a four-under par 68 on Friday to make the cut at the US$9.5 million (S$11.9 million) US PGA Players Championship.
Woods would have missed the cut in back-to-back events for the first time in his professional career if he had failed to reach the weekend at the TPC at Sawgrass.
The 14-time major champion, chasing the all-time record of 18 major titles won by Jack Nicklaus, avoided the unwelcome feat by stringing together four birdies in a row for the first time since his March victory at Bay Hill.
Woods birdied the par-4 fourth hole but followed with a bogey to leave himself still well off the cutline until his crucial birdie binge.
Woods birdied the par-3 eighth, par-5 ninth, par-4 10th and par-5 11th to stand two-under par for the tournament and two strokes beyond the cut line.
A bogey at the par-4 14th was answered by a birdie at the par-5 16th and Woods parred the 17th and 18th to reach the clubhouse secure for the weekend.
Woods failed to make the cut last week at Quail Hollow and opened with a 74 at the Players, jeopardizing his chances of finishing in the top 70 and ties to reach the final two rounds.
