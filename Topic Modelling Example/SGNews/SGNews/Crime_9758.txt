SINGAPORE - A drug offender, who was serving a jail sentence while posing as another man, has been sentenced for his own drug-related offences after he was found out by a prison officer.
According to a Straits Times report, a prison officer noticed that there were large discrepancies between the way the inmate, Yap Yew Fatt, looked in real life and in photograph records.
Subsequent investigations revealed that Tan Thiam Chye, 41, appeared in court as Yap and was serving a 43-day jail sentence for possessing uncustomed goods, illegal hawking and loss of contact under Enlistment Regulations on his behalf.
Tan had taken Yap's identity when he tried to flee Singapore on a forged passport made in Yap Yew Fatt's name.
He was arrested for Yap's offences at the Woodlands checkpoint on October 12, 2011.
He then appeared as Yap on October 14 and 21 and was sentenced to a fine of $30,100 or 43 days in jail in default.
Tan faced the court again as himself on June 19 and was sentenced to eight years and three months in jail and three strokes of the cane for his drug offences.
