He is nicknamed "The Special One" - and Jose Mourinho frequently exudes an aura of supreme, arrogant confidence.
But the Real Madrid manager - the only manager to have won the top three European football leagues: English, Italian and Spanish - turned uncharacteristically humble yesterday, when my paper posed him this question:
How does he manage to motivate so many top-class footballers - athletes loaded with money and fame - to so much success with such regularity?
"I don't think rich players lack motivation. No, they remain passionate about the game," said the Portuguese, who is in town as a guest of the Singapore Olympic Foundation (SOF).
"But they need to deal with the pressure of being a famous player and high expectations of winning big competitions.
"I just tell them that I can help them. That's all. It's nothing too special."
During his short stay in Singapore, Mourinho will visit the Singapore Sports School to chat with the Under-15 and U-16 football teams and other young athletes.
The 49-year-old remains passionate about his job, and lists passion as the most vital trait for young athletes of any sport to have.
Yesterday, he held court at 1-Altitude Bar at Raffles Place, and was insightful, forthright and occasionally sarcastic with his replies to queries.
When asked about Portugal's chances at the ongoing Euro 2012, Mourinho said that it is in their hands to beat the Netherlands and qualify for the quarter-finals.
"After that, it's hard to predict because it's a knockout competition. But, I don't rate Portugal as among the three best teams in the Euros."
And when a journalist likened the Spanish national team's tactics to those of Real's archrivals Barcelona, Mourinho shot back with a withering reply: "I don't know. You speak of Spain and Barca (as the same). But the national team of Spain have five Real Madrid players."
