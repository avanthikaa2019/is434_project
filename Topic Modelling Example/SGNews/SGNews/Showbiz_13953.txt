While singer Justin Bieber's remarks on Indonesia have sparked strong reactions, Indonesian actress and singer Julia Perez, known as Jupe, has chosen a different route by defending the teen idol.
On her Twitter account, @juliaperrez, the dangdut singer said that people such as corrupt officials tainted Indonesia's reputation more than comments like Bieber's.
"It is the corrupt officials who have destroyed Indonesia, not Bieber. Besides, he has already apologized for his comment. So why do we need to jump up and down about it?" Julia said as quoted by tribunnews.com late on Monday.
She was responding to reports in the Daily Mirror, a British tabloid that Bieber "mocked the English accent, insulted Indonesia and threw a hissy fit," when in London to premiere his new album, Believe.
During the event, Bieber told an interviewer about the creative process for one of his new tracks, saying it was recorded in some "random country".
His manager, Scott "Scooter" Braun, interrupted and informed him it was produced in Indonesia.
Another Indonesian singer, Syahrini, said on Sunday that Bieber had insulted Indonesia with his "trash-talk", saying that the 18-year-old should apologize to all the citizens of the country.
However, Julia appeared to disagree with Syahrini, saying that demanding such things was a tacky action.
"For me, people who say that Bieber does not love Indonesia are tacky. Even worse are those who demand he apologize to us. That is so alay [uncool]," she said.
