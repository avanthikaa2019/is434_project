NAYPYIDAW - Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday held talks with President Thein Sein for the first time since her landmark election to parliament earlier this month.
The pair met at his official residence in the capital Naypyidaw, the Nobel laureate's security chief Khun Tha Myint told AFP. It was their second meeting since the former general took office last year.
Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of the past 22 years locked up by the junta, will take her seat in the lower house of parliament for the first time on April 23 after a decisive victory in April 1 by-elections.
Her National League for Democracy (NLD) party secured 43 of the 44 seats it contested, becoming the main opposition force in a national parliament that remains dominated by the military and its political allies.
Thein Sein's quasi-civilian regime came to power a year ago following a controversial 2010 election that was marred by the absence of Suu Kyi and her party and won by the military's political proxies.
Suu Kyi has rejected suggestions that she could take a cabinet position.
But she has not ruled out taking on an advisory role, particularly on the subject of the ethnic minority conflicts that have gripped parts of the country since independence in 1948.
