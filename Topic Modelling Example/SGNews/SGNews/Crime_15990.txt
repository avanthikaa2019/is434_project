The 24-year-old woman who was found dead in a Jurong West flat on Saturday morning was an introvert by nature and did not have many friends, reported The New Paper today.
Instead, Miss Elise Lie would make friends online, which was how she was believed to have met her alleged murderer, her live-in boyfriend Gabriel Lee Haw Ling, 38.
A Facebook 'friend' whom Miss Lie had added five years ago told The New Paper that he had never met or heard of her.
He realised that they were friends on the social networking site only when another person pointed it out to him on Monday.
"I don't know where she could have got my name from. It's disturbing," he said, referring to her brutal death.
By yesterday evening, about 10 of her Facebook friends had written RIPs on her wall.
Miss Lie's wake, which is held at a funeral parlour at Sin Ming Drive, was a quiet affair with only a few friends turning up.
According to a Facebook wall post written by her younger brother, Mr Lie Jinn Chyua, the wake is for "only people who are sincerely going".
Another Facebook friend and junior college classmate for three months told The New Paper that Miss Lie did not talk much in JC.
Even Miss Lie's neighbours, who were invited to her wedding even though it was just the third time they had spoken, found it odd that she would do so.
Miss Lie had approached her ground floor neighbour, Mrs Carol Ng, 39, two days before her death and told her that she was engaged.
Mrs Ng's husband, 41, told The New Paper that they barely knew her and found it strange that she would mention the wedding.
He was unaware that Miss Lie's wake was held last night.
He said his wife was not able to attend the wake because she was overseas and that he might not have the time due to his sales and trading business, but he added that he might drop by to pray a bit.
"It would be a small act of sincerity, especially since she doesn't seem to have known too many people," said Mr Ng.
