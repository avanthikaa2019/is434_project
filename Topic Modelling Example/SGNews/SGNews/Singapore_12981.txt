Madam Neo Pek Choo and her daughter are more than 25 years apart in age, but when they emerged onstage together yesterday, it was tough to tell who the mother was and who the child was.
The vivacious mother-and- daughter pair caused a stir among the crowd at Compass Point in Sengkang who were watching the Mum-Me Lookalike Contest organised by Frasers Centrepoint Malls.
After sashaying down the catwalk and beating four other pairs of contestants in games designed to test if they had chemistry, Madam Neo, 41, and her daughter Samantha Soh, 15, emerged the winners in their category.
They were taking part in category A of the competition, which is for mums with children aged six to 15. Category B is for children aged 16 and above.
"Everyone tells us that we look alike, so we decided to join this contest for fun," Madam Neo, a housewife, told my paper.
In the category for children aged 16 and above, the winners were mother-daughter duo Lydia Tan, 48, and Dawn Yeo, 16.
Both pairs won a three-night cruise for four onboard SuperStar Virgo and Metro shopping vouchers worth $500 each.
"This is the best Mother's Day gift I have ever received!", Madam Neo exclaimed excitedly, clutching her daughter's hand.
Frasers Centrepoint Malls was not the only one which organised a contest for Mother's Day. NTUC Club held its My Mum is Better than Your Mum contest at Downtown East yesterday.
The competition required mums to tackle various tasks with their children, ranging from solving math puzzles to hanging clothes in record time.
This year, the competition attracted 46 teams.
The winning team, Madam Grace Lim and her daughter Quek Lin Hui, walked away with prizes worth $575.
