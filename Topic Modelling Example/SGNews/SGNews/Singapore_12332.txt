SINGAPORE - The man who was found dead in the forested area off Changi Coast Road has been identified as Mr Jason Peter Quek.
The 38-year-old, who was married to former national sailor, Tracey Tan, had a daughter and was a supplier of marine products here.
To his friends and neighbours, he was known to be a cycling enthusiast who would often go on late night rides.
Contrary to what was previously reported by The Straits Times (ST), he was not out cycling last Saturday night when the incident happened.
According to Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao, Mr Quek had been out riding his motorbike with his friends.
His body was found 100m from his motorbike, reported ST.
Mr Roger Krempl, manager of the Singapore Cycling Federation, told ST in a report on Monday that there are some dirt tracks inside the forested area. However, it is illegal to cycle on those dirt tracks.
The cause of Mr Quek's death is still unknown and the police investigations are ongoing.
Mr Quek's brother, who did not want to be named, said his brother was an 'outdoors person'.
His wife, Madam Tan, who now works as a sailing coach, was away in Holland with a team at a sailing competition when news of his death broke. She returned to Singapore on Monday afternoon, according to the ST report.
Mr Quek's family collected his body from the mortuary on Sunday morning.
