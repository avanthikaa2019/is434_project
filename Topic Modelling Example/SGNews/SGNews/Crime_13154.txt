A student admitted to stealing boxes of drinks and other items, then forging receipts for them.
Jeremy Kuek Beng Kiat, 23, an aeronautical engineering student, was sentenced to one day's jail and fined $3,000 in total, said The Straits Times.
Kuek and his girlfriend, Ong Shi Han, 23, had stolen eight boxes of Pokka drinks, a sack of rice, a power plug and an extension socket from the Blue Horizon storage room at West Coast Crescent on November 13, 2011.
He admitted to forging receipts to prove that he and his girlfriend paid for the items at Giant Tampines hypermarket and Guardian Health and Beauty.
The couple discovered the items while they were leaving Ong's condominium at around midnight. Ong acted as a lookout while Kuek stole the items.
Kuek's lawyer said he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and major depressive disorder.
