An Australian girl, 9, has allegedly been raped while holidaying in Bali with her family, according to media reports.
Australian authorities said on Thursday night that the Indonesian police were investigating the case.
"Australian consular officials are providing assistance to the girl's family,'' the foreign affairs department said in a statement.
"We understand that a suspect has been arrested.''
The New South Wales girl was reportedly snatched from her bedroom about 9 p.m. local time (8 p.m. Jakarta time) on Sunday and taken to a nearby vacant block in Kuta beach.
The girl screamed, alerting people nearby, the Seven Network reported today.
The media outlet said a 33-year-old man had been arrested and charged.
The girl's family, believed to be from the Byron Bay area in northern New South Wales, has remained in Bali.
