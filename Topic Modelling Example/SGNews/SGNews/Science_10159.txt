Unemployed man Chen Guilin gained online notoriety after he posted his self-filmed sex videos on various amateur porn sites and sex forums.
The clips had titles like "Gary Ng vs Beer Promo Auntie", "Gary Ng vs Friend's Niece" and "Gary Ng vs Chua Chu Kang girl".
Chen used the moniker Gary Ng.
He was found guilty of possessing obscene films and other offences like housebreaking, forgery and criminal breach of trust.
He was jailed for four years and two months and fined $20,000 last year.
A four-minute graphic video showing a Singaporean air stewardess/part-time actress having sex with a man appeared on US and regional websites in early 2010.
The clip focused almost entirely on the woman in explicit poses performing sex acts.
She had appeared in several drama series and did not say much when contacted.
The video was taken down soon after.
Then 17, she achieved infamy and indecent proposals after a video of her boyfriend and her having sex was uploaded to the Internet in 2006.
She had lost her mobile phone containing the private clips.
Malaysian DVD pirates even hawked copies of the clip for RM10 (S$4).
