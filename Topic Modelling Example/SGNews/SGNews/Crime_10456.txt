AMMAN - A 17-year-old Jordanian went on a shooting spree, killing his father, mother, two brothers and an uncle because he had "differences" with them, police said on Thursday.
"The suspect has confessed to killing five members of his family, including his father, who works as a teacher, mother, two brothers, who study at a local university and his uncle, a retired colonel," a police spokesman told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"The schoolboy, who claimed that he shot dead his family because he had differences with them, was arrested less than 24 hours after he committed the crime" in Sweileh, in Amman's north, he said.
The spokesman added that police "found the bodies wrapped in clothes on the floor of the family house."
"Almost all of the victims have been shot in the head," he said, adding that further investigations were under way. He did not elaborate on the nature of the "differences."
