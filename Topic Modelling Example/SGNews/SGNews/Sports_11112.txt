HONG KONG - Japan's Ryo Ishikawa, the youngest golfer ever to win a professional tournament, and South Korea's nine-times title winner Kim Kyung-tae were Wednesday picked for Asia's Royal Trophy team.
The dynamic duo were chosen by the Asian side's Japanese captain Naomichi 'Joe' Ozaki to play against Europe at the sixth edition of the intercontinental tournament, which will be held in Brunei in December.
"Ryo Ishikawa and Kim Kyung-tae are great champions and both have comprehensively proven their ability to perform very well under pressure at the Royal Trophy," said Ozaki at the announcement in Hong Kong.
"I am looking forward to bringing together a powerful Asian team to compete against the Europeans - and we certainly will fight fiercely to secure the victory for our Asian continent."
At just 20 years of age Ishikawa holds a number of impressive records, including being the youngest-ever winner of a professional title and the only player ever to record a round of 58 on a major professional tour.
Rising star Kim has bagged nine professional titles and finished top of the Japan tour's Order of Merit in 2010.
Europe currently hold both the Royal Trophy and the Ryder Cup, and will be captained by Jose Maria Olazabal.
