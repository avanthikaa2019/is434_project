LONDON - English football icon David Beckham's dream of Olympic participation was given a boost after he was included in Britain's 35-man provisional squad on Friday.
The announcement of Stuart Pearce's final 18-man squad will be made on July 6 and Beckham, if confirmed in the final squad, would appear as one of three permitted overage players.
Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy, Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard have also been mentioned as potential candidates.
Beckham's name has been a constant though, mainly due to the influential role he played in getting the Olympics to London in the first place.
The 37-year-old is still hugely popular despite not having played club football in England for nine years.
It is yet to be decided whether the Football Association will formally announce the 35-man squad.
