Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau's Malaysian wife Carol Chu giving birth to a baby girl on May 8 continues to dominate the Chinese entertainment news, major Chinese dailies reported.
Guang Ming Daily reported that Lau accompanied Chu, who gave birth to her first baby via Caesarean section, into the delivery room on Wednesday morning.
"The 50-year-old singer was in tears when he held his baby for the first time," it reported.
It said the due date for the baby was actually on Friday but Chu had pains on Tuesday night and was admitted to a hospital in Hong Kong immediately.
Hong Kong media had camped in front of the hospital to get a glimpse of Lau and his family members but failed to capture any photos. Lau's fans shared the news and congratulated him on his official fan page.
Lau's close friend and Hong Kong actor Jordan Chan posted a photo of a baby in an incubator on the Chinese microblog Weibo.
It sparked the news that it was Lau's baby girl but thus far the media failed to contact Chan for a confirmation.
