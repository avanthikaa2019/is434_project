TOKYO - Sin Chew Daily reported that a Singaporean woman caused a delay at Narita airport in Japan when she boarded a flight without paying for a seat.
Airport authorities said the woman had arrived from South Korea on June 13 and went through security but they were not sure how she got on the flight bound for Taipei.
A flight attendant conducted a check and realised that she was occupying a seat that was supposed to be empty.
She was escorted out of the aircraft when she could not produce her ticket.
Fearing that she could be from a terrorist group, passengers were asked to leave the aircraft for another security check.
The Singaporean was later released without any action being taken.
