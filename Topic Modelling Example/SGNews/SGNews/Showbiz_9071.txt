Former MTV VJ Utt (far right) will be one of the first male ambassadors for skincare giant SK-II's new range - SK-II Men.
Joining the 38-year-old Thai-American actor-host are local film-maker Boo Junfeng (centre) and Singaporean businessman Suraj Melwani (far left).
Said Utt: "Being on TV over the years has taught me that every single detail is magnified when captured on screen and having good skin is critical to my overall look.
"I believe being well-groomed is not only a reflection of my personality and character, but also the way I value and portray myself," he added.
