KUALA LUMPUR - Rain brought an early halt to the Maybank Malaysian Open for the second day in a row Saturday with Louis Oosthuizen holding a one-shot lead in the third round.
The South African major-winner was three-under through 10 holes for a 13-under-par aggregate score, ahead of Scotland's Stephen Gallacher who had played 11.
Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello, England's Danny Willett and David Lipsky of the United States shared third place, three shots off the pace.
Germany's Martin Kaymer was six back through 12 holes and 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel, the first-round leader, was trailing by seven after 13 holes.
The latest interruption follows a one-hour halt earlier on Saturday and a wash-out of the final hours of play on Friday in the $2.5 million European and Asian Tour event.
Play will resume at 7:45 am Sunday (2345 GMT Saturday) with the fourth round scheduled to start at 8:30 am. However, officials said more rain was forecast for Sunday.
