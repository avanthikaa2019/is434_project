THE OBSERVATORY
Catacombs (The Observatory)
Dark, visceral and multi-faceted, the latest album by this home grown experimental outfit will get under your skin - and stay there.
Always one for reinvention, Leslie Low and crew make darn sure each of the 10 tracks - for instance, the sprawling Insomnia - provokes emotion.
