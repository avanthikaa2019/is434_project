Think you're a star?
If you do, you can participate in a YouTube centric talent discovery competition, provided you're Malaysian and over 18 (Sorry Malaysian Justin Bieber wannabes!).
In this competition called YouTube to You Live sing off, you'll be judged by cool indie musicians like Liyana Fizi and bands Pesawat, An Honest Mistake and The Azenders.
If you get to the finals, you'll even be able to strut your stuff to a live crowd at our very own local indie-hangout, Laundry Bar.
If you get the top spot, you'll stand a chance to stage a concert at the venue in July.
What you need to do to get the ball rolling, is record a video and send your entry to fb,com/laundrybar.
But hold your musical horses, the program will only be active on April 23.
It doesn t matter if the video is filmed on your handphone, it's just got to be good, say the organisers.
Darrin Lim, who heads the company that initiated the competition, Chaswood, said that anyone who's got talent, whether solo or in a band, should enter.
"Anyone that can make a wierd noise should enter," he adds.
Initially, 50 videos will be shortlisted through public voting, before being whittled down to ten, by a combination of public and judges votes.
After which, the top ten will battle it out and Laundry Bar.
The top three wil be decided by the judges,
The grand prizewinner will be get RM5,000(S$2,038) cash and RM1,000 Laundry vouchers.
The first runner up will receive RM3,000 and RM500 Laundry vouchers while the second runner will receive RM1,000 cash and RM250 Laundry vouchers.
