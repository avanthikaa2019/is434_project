A 56-year old man surnamed Chen has filed court proceedings to disown his two sons, after discovering that he is not their biological parent.
Chen is also suing his ex-wife, surnamed Huang, for a sum of NT$4,370,000. (S$185,725)
"Whenever I think about those two sons and my ex-wife committing adultery while I was at work, I am overwhelmed with sorrow," said Chen, who added that he is sleeping with the aid of pills.
The sons, 30 and 29 years old, are both unmarried.
Chen said that although he has "developed feelings" after "so many years of raising them," he finds it impossible to accept "another man's sons."
According to Chen's account, Huang maintained a relationship with a man surnamed Hsu before and after her marriage.
Huang bore the two sons on the second and third years of her marriage with Chen.
Chen discovered the affair 14 years ago and promptly divorced his wife.
Four years after their divorce, he arranged a DNA test on his second son and confirmed that he is not the boy's biological father.
Last year, Chen discovered that his first son had taken his mother's last name. A second DNA test showed that he is also not the first son's biological father.
