Singapore Airlines' third daily service between Singapore and London will be switched to the A380 from June 1.
Currently, two of the services are on the superjumbo, while the third is on the Boeing 777-300ER. The switch to the larger A380 will increase seat capacity on the route by 17 per cent a day.
