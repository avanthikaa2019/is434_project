The Agricultural Technology Faculty (Fateta) of the Bogor Agriculture University (IPB) has developed a new staple food similar to rice in a bid to support food diversification programs.
"Our team at Fateta IPB has managed to create food similar to rice, which was not made from paddy, but it can be cooked just like regular rice," faculty dean Sam Herodian said during a meeting of Fateta IPB alumnus in Bogor, West Java, on Saturday, as quoted by Antara.
The new staple food can be a mix of many sources of carbohydrates, such as corn, tubers and buckwheat, which are widely available.
Sam said that it would be easy for Indonesian people who depend on rice as their staple food to accept the new modified food.
