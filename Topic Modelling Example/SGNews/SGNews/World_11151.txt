SYDNEY - Australia's central bank cut the interest rate by 25 basis points yesterday to 3.5 per cent, amid fears over weakness in Europe and easing growth in key trade partner China.
The cut adds to the 50 basis points the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed from interest rates last month, bringing them to a level not seen in the booming mining economy since November 2009.
"With modest domestic growth and a weaker and more uncertain international environment, the outlook for inflation afforded scope for a more accommodative stance of monetary policy," Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said.
The news saw the Australian dollar immediately rise from 97.26 US cents to 97.82 US cents, and it remained at about 97.86 US cents late yesterday.
Mr Stevens said that while growth in the world economy picked up early this year, more recent indicators suggested further weakening in Europe and some easing in growth in China.
"Financial-market sentiment has deteriorated over the past month," he said, noting that the RBA had previously said that Europe would remain a potential source of adverse shocks.
"Europe's economic and financial prospects have again been clouded by weakening growth, heightened political uncertainty and concerns about fiscal sustainability and the strength of some banks."
He said "the ongoing trend is unclear and could be dampened by slower Chinese growth".
