A 31-year-old man was charged yesterday with one count of housebreaking.
At around 8am on Jan 9, Teo Boon Hui allegedly used a metal rod to force open a door lock before entering the Grand Hollywood club at Clarke Quay.
He purportedly committed the offence with two others, Yeoh Cheng San and Gary Ng Seng Hung.
The trio allegedly made off with two safes containing $79,120 in cash, as well as account books, invoices, payment vouchers, a black wallet and 12 Thailand passports.
Teo will be back in court next Friday.
If convicted of the offence, he could be jailed up to 10 years.
