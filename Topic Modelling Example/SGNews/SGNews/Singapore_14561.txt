At first glance, the Gulfstream G550-based airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft looks like any other private jet.
But it's not.
While the commercial version has been used to carry political notables like the prime minister of Turkey, the G550 has seen heavy use in a military capacity.
Singapore's Ministry of Defence has acquired specially modified models of these planes to protect our airspace.
The aircraft is capable of travelling more than 1,000kmh and has a detection range of more than 370km in a 360-degree radius.
While it carries no armaments of its own, the G550-AEW carries a series of flares and chaff as defensive measures.
This latest addition to the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF) fleet replaces the old E-2C Hawkeye, which has served since 1987.
On April 13, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen declared that theG550-AEW had achieved full operational capability.
The RSAF now has four such aircraft.The first was delivered in February 2009 and the fourth arrived in October 2011.
They were bought from Israel Aerospace Industries in 2007. Israel is the only other country that has adapted the G550 for AEW use.
The G550-AEW is operated by the RSAF's 111 Squadron and combines with the RSAF's ground-based sensors and command and control systems to react to threats within Singapore's airspace.
