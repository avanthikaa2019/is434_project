LOS ANGELES - Wildfires have forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 homes in the western US state of Colorado, authorities said Sunday.
The latest blaze broke out Saturday in Waldo Canyon national park, west of Colorado Springs, spreading out over 2,000 acres (800 hectares), according to officials.
Authorities said 1,050 homes were evacuated in areas around Waldo Canyon, including Cascade, Chipita Park, Manitou Springs and Green Mountain Falls.
Press reports indicated that some 11,000 people were admitted to shelters.
"Our folks want to make sure everyone stays safe," Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper told CBS television.
Four other fires were reported in Colorado, the biggest being a blaze in Little Sand, which by Sunday had consumed nearly 19,500 acres (8,000 hectares) but was partially contained, the state's emergency management agency said.
