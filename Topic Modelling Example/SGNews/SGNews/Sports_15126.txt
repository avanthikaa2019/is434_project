KINGSTON - Jamaican triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt opened his 2012 season with a sizzling anchor leg as his Racers Track Club logged a world leading time of 37.82 seconds in a 4x100 metres relay on Saturday.
Bolt, who had twice delayed his season opener in February for undisclosed reasons, looked smooth as he outpaced compatriot and former 100 metres world record holder Asafa Powell to win by 10 metres in cool, wet conditions.
""It was my first run and I am happy I got through," the 100 and 200 metres Olympic champion and world record holder said.
""It was a bit chilly with some rain but this is what we are used to in Europe so it is ok."
Bolt's team of Mario Forsythe, Yohan Blake and Kimmari Roach had given him a three metres lead before he added to the distance against Powell of the rival MVP Track Club team, which crossed the line in 38.27.
""For me, it's just about execution," said Bolt, who expects to defend both sprint titles in London.
""I have been working on my start. Last year that eluded me, but I have to work my way through it this season so I am just looking forward to getting that done."
The lanky sprinter, who retained his 200 meters world title last year after false starting in the 100 metres final, said his preparations for London were going well.
""Everything is coming together," he said. ""We have about 100 days to go before the Olympics so I am just taking my time and working on what I need to," he said.
He said his coach, Glen Mills, made the decision to delay his season until Saturday.
