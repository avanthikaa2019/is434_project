National swimmer Tao Li won the 100m butterfly at the South-east Asia Swimming Championships today with a timing of 59.23 seconds.
She was more than two seconds ahead of second placed Thi Kim Tuyen of Vietnam (1:01.30), and narrowly missed her Olympic "B" (OGB) timing by 0.09s.
Tao Li is billed as Singapore's biggest hope for a medal in this year's London Olympics. However, the swim queen was not satisfied with her own performance.
"My coach said I did alright, but my expectation is higher and I still feel I can go faster.
"I think I can still improve on my back end speed. I've been working on it a lot. It was good during training, but not in tonight's race. I'm aiming to hit below 30.2s," she said.
Another Singapore swimmer met his match in the men's 100m backstroke event.
Quah Zheng Wen lost to Indonesian Gede Siman Sudartawa, who clocked a timing of 55.32s, meeting the OGB mark and recording his second victory over Quah.
Siman, 17, said he was disappointed with his performance.
"I didn't start smoothly, and went off course slightly.
"I'm happy with the gold, and will be aiming for gold in Sunday's 50m backstroke," he said.
When asked whether he can surpass Siman in the sprint events one day, Quah said it may be possible in the future.
"For now, I'm focusing on endurance, and doing well in the 200m events coming up."
"This (the sprint event) is Siman's domain. He's bigger and stronger, and it possibly counts in these type of events," he said.
22-year-old Glenn Victor, also from Indonesia, beat Singaporean Ng Kai Wee Rainer and compatriot Triady Fauzi in the men's 100m butterfly.
In Day Three's other events, Yeap Soon Choy Kevin won the men's 400m freestyle, while Vietnamese prodigy Nguyen Thi Anh Vien won the women's 100m backstroke.
