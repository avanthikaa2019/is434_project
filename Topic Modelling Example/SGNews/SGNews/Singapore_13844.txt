SINGAPORE - Supermarket chain FairPrice wants to raise the number of hours that staff spend on volunteer work by 10 times come 2016.
To help achieve this, FairPrice yesterday launched its first volunteers' programme to encourage staff to give back to society.
With the new programme, FairPrice aims to make it easier for employees to volunteer, by organising company-led initiatives regularly.
The programme will see 13 volunteer leaders in charge of organising the activities in a more structured way than in the past.
FairPrice plans to hit 2,300 hours of volunteer work by staff annually come 2016, from 200 hours last year.
An increase in the number of volunteer activities is also being planned, from 12 yearly to 75 by then.
With the launch of the new programme, Ren Ci Nursing Home resident Chew Eng Huay, 66, "hopes to see the volunteers more often" as they brighten up her day when they visit.
