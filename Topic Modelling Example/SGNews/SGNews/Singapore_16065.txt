SINGAPORE - The High Court will hear the application by a Hougang resident about a by-election in the constituency on April 16 in a full-day session, reported The Straits Times.
On March 2, Mdm Vellama Vellama Marie Muthu, 42, filed an application with the High Court to hold the Prime Minister accountable for calling a by-election in her constituency within three months.
On March 9, PM Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament that he intends to call a by-election for Hougang, but did not say when he will do so.
Lawyer M Ravi, who is representing Madam Vellama, said this indicated that PM Lee may be meaning to call the by-election only four years from now.
He is asking the court to declare that the Prime Minister does not have "unfettered discretion" to decide whether and when to call a by-election.
Late last month, the High Court reserved judgement on the application, after a three-and-a-half hour hearing held at the Supreme Court.
