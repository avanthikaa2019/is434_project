The Media Development Authority (MDA) is investigating the repeated disruptions in SingTel mio TV's live telecasts of the English Premier League (EPL) season finale on Sunday.
An MDA spokesman who spoke to The Straits Times said: "We take a serious view of service disruptions and will not hesitate to take firm action against service providers that breach their licensing conditions."
The Barclays Premier League finale night saw ten concurrent matches that kicked off at the same time.
Manchester City and Manchester United were also fighting in their respective games for the EPL title in a dramatic neck and neck race. Manchester City won the title with two goals late in the game.
But football fans weren't happy as live telecasts of key matches were disrupted many times by frozen or blanked-out screens. The telco is the sole broadcaster of EPL matches here.
In a statement made on Monday, the telco said that customers in Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh, Tampines, Bukit Panjang and the central area were 'potentially affected'.
The full extent is not yet known, with residents outside of these areas also complaining about experiencing the breakdown.
SingTel said that the high number of viewers switching channels repeatedly caused their system to slow down.
The telco also said they will be contacting affected customers to explain the issue in the next two weeks and will be offered a "goodwill gesture". According to The Straits Times, the compensation is believed to be a month's waiver of subscription fees.
As of Tuesday morning (May 15), the company's Facebook page had about 900 posts berating it for the disruption.
This is not the first time the mioTV service had service problems. 10,000 subscribers were affected two years ago when the service was down for 12 hours. SingTel was fined $50,000, reported The Straits Times.
