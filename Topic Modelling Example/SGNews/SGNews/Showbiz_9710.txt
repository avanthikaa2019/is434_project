Radio Taiwan International (RTI) hosts Natalie Tso and Jan Wan-ru have won two New York Festivals awards for their radio documentary "Freeing Taiwan's Slaves." The New York Festivals is an international awards group awarding the world's best work in radio, TV, film and advertising. This was the first time that radio hosts from Taiwan were honored with the award.
Tso and Jan received a Gold Medal for Best News Documentary and a Bronze Medal for Best Social Affairs Documentary at an awards ceremony at the Manhattan Penthouse in late June. "Freeing Taiwan's Slaves" is an in-depth report on the fight against human trafficking in Taiwan. The program features an interview with "Senja," an Indonesian foreign worker who was forced into prostitution in Taiwan and later escaped to a shelter. When she took her case to court, she helped free seven other Indonesian women who were enslaved in the same sex ring in Miaoli. Senja's case is the first in Taiwan that went to the Supreme Court under the Human Trafficking Prevention Act, which was put into effect in 2009. The traffickers were sentenced to 18 months. "Freeing Taiwan's Slaves" also presents true stories of other sex and labor trafficking victims, as well as the perspectives of shelter workers, NGOs, prosecutors and officials who are working to help these victims.
Tso said the purpose of the documentary was to bring greater awareness to the issue and to call on the people and government of Taiwan to step up their fight against human trafficking.
"Freeing Taiwan's Slaves" also won the 2011 Best Current Affairs Radio Documentary award given by the UK-based Association of International Broadcasting. Tso also won the 2011 Golden Bell Award for Best Program Host on Social Issues, while Jan won the 2011 Excellent News Report Award for the duo's human trafficking series.
