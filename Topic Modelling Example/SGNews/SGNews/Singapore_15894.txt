A new study claims that Chinese people and Christians in Singapore have become more likely to accept other faiths and races in the past four years.
Singaporeans in general are now more likely to be open-minded, said Dr Norman Vasu and research fellow Yolanda Chin from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University, who led the project.
The survey was conducted last year before the recent spate of online racist posts. The researchers interviewed 2,100 citizens and compared the findings to an identical survey they conducted in 2007.
They found that the probability of a Chinese Singaporean or Christian accepting people of other races and religions as teachers, neighbours, bosses and political leaders rose from 40 per cent to 70 per cent.
Malay interviewees remained as likely to be open-minded - the probability was 70 per cent in both surveys.
