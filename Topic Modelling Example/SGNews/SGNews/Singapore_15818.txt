Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts Yaacob Ibrahim said the freedom and flexibility to air one's views online is welcomed, but it should be governed by real life rules.
Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of self-help group Mendaki's 30th anniversary celebrations, Mr Yaacob Ibrahim said behaviour on the Internet must reflect a person's knowledge on whether certain things can be said.
The impact on social media is far greater than in personal interaction, he said.
Recent incidents about netizens making derogatory comments on race and nationality have caused a furore among Singaporeans.
In one incident, a Chinese undergraduate scholarship holder was fined $3,000 and had his scholarship benefits terminated after he called Singaporeans "more dog than human". He was also made to perform community service.
In another incident, a local polytechnic student posted an allegedly racist remark on microblogging site Twitter.
Her tweet went viral.
Mr Yaacob also said that areas such as race, language and religion are areas where boundaries must still be held and that there are laws to protect these areas.
However, he said the Government will continue with the light-touch approach towards Internet regulations and only intervene when social security or racial harmony is affected.
Mr Yaacob told the media that he believes an Internet code of conduct is necessary and that the onus is on Internet users to define its contents, even as MICA will supervise and guide the process of developing such a code.
He also advised social media users to use common sense and verify the accuracy of online reports.
Mr Yaacob was referring to the recent online hoaxes of child kidnapping cases which panicked Singaporeans.
