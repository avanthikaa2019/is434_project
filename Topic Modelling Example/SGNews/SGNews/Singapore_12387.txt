A woman in Singapore who says she still loves her husband has filed for a divorce - claiming that she can no longer meet his extreme sexual demands.
Sin Chew Daily reported that the 49-year-old clerk was fed up with her husband of 25 years who would demand for sex at least three times a day.
She said her husband, who is in his 50s, would get angry and sometimes hit their son when she rejected his sexual advances.
"I can no longer take it. He would get very angry if I reject him.
"Once, I refused to have sex with him because I was too tired and he hit our son who had just turned one-month old," recalled the woman.
The couple married in 1987 and have three children.
The woman said her husband would also compare her sexual performance with his ex-girlfriend whom he claimed would have sex with him 13 times a day.
"His words really hurt. He would get angry and yelled at me whenever I rejected him," she said.
The woman decided to file for divorce even though she still loved her husband,
"I cannot continue living like this. My children are grown up, and that is why I have asked for divorce," she said.
