Manchester City's youth team will be taking part in this year's Canon Lion City Cup from June 23 to July 1.
The youth-football tournament, into its 24th edition, will also feature the youth teams of the Netherlands' Ajax Amsterdam and Portugal's FC Porto.
Argentina's Boca Juniors will also be there, together with Singapore's national Under-15 and Under-16 teams.
Title sponsor Canon, which has sponsored the Cup since last year, announced yesterday that it has extended its sponsorship through next year.
There will be several changes to this year's tournament format.
Teams will be allowed five substitutions instead of three and the duration of each half will be 40 minutes instead of 45.
There will also be a new fifth/sixth-placing match, and a sudden-death penalty-kick competition at the end of each group-stage match. No points awarded, but the penalty-kick competition will serve as a tiebreaker in the group stages.
