A regular in the Singapore Navy has been suspended and arrested on charges of alleged acts of indecency.
The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said that 21-year-old Lieutenant (LTA) Benedict Ang Yong Chuean was training at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.
LTA Ang was arrested on Sunday after he allegedly entered the room of a female cadet on May 6, reported the Australian media.
LTA Ang has been charged with two counts of indecency without consent.
On Tuesday, in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Magistrates Court, LTA Ang pleaded not guilty to both charges.
He is currently out on bail under the condition that he not make contact with five other cadets at the Academy.
He has since surrendered his passport to the court, Australian reports said.
The cadet is scheduled to appear in court again on August 9.
