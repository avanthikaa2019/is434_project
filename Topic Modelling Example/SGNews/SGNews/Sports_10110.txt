SAN FRANCISCO - Webb Simpson won the 112th US Open golf championship Sunday, firing a final-round 68 for a one-stroke victory in the second major of the year.
Simpson, playing in his second US Open, emerged from four punishing days on The Olympic Club's Lake Course with a one-over par total of 281.
That gave him a one-shot victory over Michael Thompson, and 2010 champion Graeme McDowell.
Jim Furyk led much of the day but was unable to claim a second US Open crown nine years after his first.
