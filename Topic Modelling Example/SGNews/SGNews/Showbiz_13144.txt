It's been almost two decades since this R&amp;B songstress released her debut album, Miss Thang.
But Miss Thang she is no longer, as her sixth album proves as she struggles to keep things relevant, falling back on the 1990s smooth-ballad formula that earned her prior hits.
Her latest collaboration with Brandy on It All Belongs To Me sure is a blast from the past, though - it recalls their 1998 mega-hit, The Boy Is Mine.
Monica New Life (Sony) 2.5/5 stars
