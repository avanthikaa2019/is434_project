KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia - A routine operation by several enforcement officers to catch a couple for committing khalwat turned awry when the male suspect chased them with a machete.
The incident, which occurred at 9pm on Wednesday, began when seven state Islamic Affairs Department officers received information about a lorry driver who was believed to be involved in khalwat (close proximity) with a 29-year-old woman in his house at Kampung Tok Kaya, Chabang Tiga, here.
When they managed to catch the couple red-handed in the house, the enraged suspect picked up a machete beside his bed and chased the officers.
The shocked officers ran out and hid inside their van for safety.
The man smashed the van's right side mirror with his machete before escaping in his car.
The woman was detained.
Police apprehended the suspect, who is in his 30s, at a foodstall along Jalan Hiliran, 10km from the house, at about 11am yesterday.
