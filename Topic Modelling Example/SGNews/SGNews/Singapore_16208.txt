Community gardens help foster the "kampung spirit" and bring communities together, including those living in private residential estates.
In his blog post yesterday, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan identified the National Parks Board's Community In Bloom (CIB) programme as an effective way of fostering harmony among residents from all walks of life.
"Learning as a group, working together and striving for a common goal, brings the gardeners closer together," he wrote.
Mr Khaw singled out two such gardens: one on the roof of the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun, and the other at a private estate in Goldhill, which is in his former Moulmein constituency.
"I was happy to reconnect with my former residents. With much pride, they told me of their garden's achievements. It won three top awards at the Singapore Garden Festival 2010," he said.
He added that the garden in Goldhill is flourishing and benefits "the butterflies and the birds".
"They (the residents) told me that hornbills now visit their garden daily. They have photos to show. Butterflies and dragonflies have become permanent residents there."
Since the start of the CIB project in Mayfair Park Estate in May 2005, some 480 such vegetable gardens have sprung up in places such as residential estates and schools, and at organisations.
"It is a fantastic way for the community to bond, learn a new hobby and skill, make new friends and enjoy the fruits of their labour," said Mr Khaw.
He noted that the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority has also played a role since last year by lending its expertise to residents working on their CIB projects.
While a lot has been done to build communities, Mr Khaw said "we can still do very much more".
"We are highly urbanised, but we can also be kampung and urban farmers, growing our own vegetables," he said.
"Along the way, we add to the neighbourhood's biodiversity and our quality of life."
