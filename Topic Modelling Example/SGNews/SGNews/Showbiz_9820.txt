Nearly three years after Michael Jackson died while preparing for his comeback tour, four of his brothers - Marlon, Jermaine, Tito and Jackie - launched their Unity tour on Wednesday, five days ahead of the third anniversary of Michael's death from an overdose of the anaesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009.
Unity marks the first time the brothers have toured together since their Victory outing in 1984.
