SINGAPORE - Applications for $3 million worth of U-Stretch vouchers will open from May 7 to June 10. In further good news, the income eligibility criteria for low-income union members to do so has been lowered.
This means that more NTUC members in the lowest 20th percentile of household income will stand to benefit from the U-Stretch Vouchers Programme.
The vouchers are disbursed to provide relief to union members who need help for their living expenses, especially for daily necessities.
Each successful applicant will receive one booklet with $100 worth of vouchers, with each voucher worth $2.50. They can be redeemed with a minimum spending of $5.00 at participating NTUC Social Enterprises.
Previously, those with a gross household income limit of $2,200, or per capita income limit of $600, were eligible to apply.
Now, the gross household income limit has been raised to $2,800, or a per capita income limit of $725.
Union members without dependents are eligible to apply if their monthly gross personal income does not exceed $1,400.
The programme is expected to help about 30,000 low-income union members.
The reviews were done in view of the uncertain economic outlook and the rising cost of living caused by the pressures of inflation, said NTUC's Care and Share Director, Mr Zainal Bin Sapari.
Interested members of the public can apply at www.ntuc.org.sg/ucare/apply, or apply in paper to the respective unions they belong to.
