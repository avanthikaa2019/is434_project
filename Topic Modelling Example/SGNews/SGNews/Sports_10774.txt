Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Argentina beat archrivals Brazil 4-3 in a friendly last Saturday, dealing a blow to the Brazilians as they wrapped up their preparations for the London Olympics.
The hat-trick was Messi's second in three matches for Argentina. His tally for the national side now stands at 26 goals in 70 matches.
