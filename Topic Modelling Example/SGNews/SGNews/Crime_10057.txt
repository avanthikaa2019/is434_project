INDIA - The mother of an 11-year-old girl in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, allowed her 45-year-old lover to rape her daughter, reported Tamil Nesan.
The matter came to light after doctors in Rajaji Hospital found that the girl suffered continuous bleeding from her private parts when her mother brought her there for treatment.
Suspecting sexual assault, the doctors alerted the police, who then interrogated the 35-year-old mother. The mother later confessed to allowing contractor T. Ravi, of Vandiyur village, to rape her daughter.
Police said Ravi, who is also a moneylender, had been having an affair with the mother and would often visit her home without her husband's knowledge.
On one such visit on Thursday, Ravi had sex with the girl with her mother's consent.
The mother has since been arrested while police are on the hunt for Ravi, who has gone into hiding.
