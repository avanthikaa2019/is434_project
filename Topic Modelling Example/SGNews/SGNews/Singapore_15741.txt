THE 790-room Pan Pacific Singapore will undergo its biggest overhaul since it first opened in 1987, with the hotel closing from mid-April to faciliate the $80 million renovation works.
Its owner Hotel Marina City, a subsidiary of Singapore Land, will fund the upgrading works.
Guest rooms, restaurants and the lobby will undergo a major facelift, with the highlight to be the Pacific Club on Level 38, which will boast an unfettered 360 degree vantage point, the hotel said in a press release.
One hundred and fifty rooms as well as the public areas on level one will be re-opened from August while the five-star hotel will be fully operational from September.
&ldquo;The transformation will enhance our competitive advantage in the Marina Bay vicinity. Pan Pacific Singapore will emerge newly refreshed and it will spur the momentum of our growth,&rdquo; said general manager Scott Swank.
He added: &ldquo;By September 2012, we look forward to welcoming them back at a new Pan Pacific Singapore.&rdquo;
New features and concepts are influenced by insights from guests and staff from research and a review conducted of the brand.
Australian firm CHADA as well as restaurant and bar design studio Blueplate have been hired to handle interior design.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ballroom, the hotel's swimming pool, fitness centre, spa and its pool restaurant will remain open from April to July, as will the two night clubs located by the hotel, the Royal Room and Club Mink.
Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts' portfolio includes 19 hotels, resorts and serviced suites including those under development in 12 countries across Asia, North America and Oceania.
