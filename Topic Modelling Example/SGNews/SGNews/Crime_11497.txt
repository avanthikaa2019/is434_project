A business development manager was sentenced to five weeks' jail for attacking a taxi driver over a fare dispute.
Andrew Tan Soo Kiat, 36, also damaged the bonnet of the taxi by jumping on it.
The court heard that Tan had been heavily drinking with a client before he and a friend boarded Hong Lee Tat's taxi at around 3am on September 1, 2010.
When they arrived at their destination, a condominium in Balestier, Tan and his friend alighted without paying the $15 fare.
An argument ensued, and Tan became aggressive. He eventually paid up, and Tong drove off.
But Tan and his friend went to confront Hong as he was leaving the condominium.
Tan damaged the taxi's bonnet by jumping on it. The cost of the damage came up to $300.
Tan also verbally abused Hong, and punched and kicked him. The attack caused Hong to fall and hit his head.
A security supervisor nearby who witnessed the incident pulled Tan away.
The court was told that Tan apologised to Hong and compensated him with $771.
Tan pleaded guilty to one count of causing mischief and another count of voluntarily causing hurt.
The maximum punishment for mischief is a one year jail term and a fine. For voluntarily causing hurt, the maximum punishment is a jail term of up to two years and a $5,000 fine.
