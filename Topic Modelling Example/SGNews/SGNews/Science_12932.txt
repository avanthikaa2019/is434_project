In a bid to reach out to the wider community through technology, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) has launched a monthly magazine for the iPhone.
PoliceLife@SG is the digital version of SPF's in-house magazine Police Life Monthly (PLM).
the app features photos and videos not available in the print version of the magazine.
The app was previously launched for the iPad in June 2011.
In addition, PoliceLife@SG for iPad now has a smoother, user interface featuring exclusive audio-visual content to enhance users' reading experience.
The PoliceLife@SG app follows the launch of Police@SG, an app launched for iPhone and Android users last year.
The app provides users with content such as crime information in their neighbourhoods, crime prevention advisories, and the address of police stations nearest to them.
SPF plans to further enhance the app to include pop-up alerts and easy response to police appeals for information.
