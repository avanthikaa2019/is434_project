TAIPEI - A group of Chinese workers from Foxconn Technology Group arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Sunday for a seven-day tour of the country, courtesy of their employer. The 216 Foxconn employees from 17 provinces and 21 factories in China are scheduled to visit many popular tourist sites, including Taipei's Shilin Night Market, Taipei 101, the National Palace Museum, the scenic Sun Moon Lake and Alishan in central Taiwan, and Kaohsiung's Lioho night market.
Many of the employees expressed excitement upon arrival on their first visit to Taiwan, and thanked the company for providing such a wonderful opportunity to experience the country's culture.
The company will be footing the bill for all the costs involved, and the 216 outstanding Foxconn workers, nicknamed "The Stars of Foxconn" will receive vacation pay during the trip.
The tour is part of a plan by Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou to help reduce worker stress and to encourage high-performing workers, according to a report in the Chinese-language United Daily News.
In addition, the company recently announced that it will be implementing a series of policies to improve employee benefits, including increasing wages in both Taiwan and China, and cutting the number of working hours in its Chinese facilities, the report added. Foxconn, which is one of Apple's major suppliers has denied media accusations that it exploits its workers and has been trying to rid itself of its sweatshop image.
Media reports in recent years have said the technology company's Chinese factories of paying low wages to workers hired to assemble Apple's iPad and iPhone products, and that working conditions might have led to the suicides of several factory workers.
