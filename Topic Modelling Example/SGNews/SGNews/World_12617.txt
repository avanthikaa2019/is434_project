WELLINGTON - New Zealand police charged a US student with careless driving Friday over a crash on a remote highway that killed three of his college classmates.
The 20-year-old Boston University student was charged with three counts of careless driving causing death and four of careless driving causing injury, police said.
The crash occurred on Saturday when the van he was driving - one of two carrying 16 students on a hiking excursion - left the road and rolled, near Tongariro National Park on North Island.
Students Daniela Lekhno, 20, Roch Jauberty, 21 and Austin Brashears, 21, died at the scene. Four others were injured, one of whom remains in a critical condition in hospital.
The students were taking courses at Auckland University as part of an exchange programme.
Police did not name the driver but local media identified him as US citizen Stephen Houseman.
He appeared at Auckland District Court on Friday and was bailed to reappear on June 8 after surrendering his passport. He was not required to enter a plea.
Police inspector Kevin Taylor said investigators had found no evidence any of the students, including the driver, were affected by drugs or alcohol.
