The water pipeline along the Tampines Expressway will be shut down from Monday to Thursday for enhancement works, national water agency PUB said yesterday.
The pipeline supplies water to Tampines, Pasir Ris, Loyang, Changi and parts of Bedok.
But the water supply to these areas will not be affected, as water will be supplied through an alternative channel.
The enhancement works will involve emptying the water pipeline to facilitate the installation of new flow meters.
These meters can provide real- time information on the amount of water flowing through the pipe.
This will improve the monitoring and management of the water- supply network, said PUB.
When the works are completed and the pipeline is being filled up, tiny air bubbles may form in the water, due to water-pressure changes.
This may cause tap water to have a milky appearance. PUB said the water will become clear if it is left to stand for a few minutes.
The agency added that the air bubbles do not affect water quality and the water remains safe for drinking.
For assistance, call the 24-hour toll-free hotline, 1800-2846600.
