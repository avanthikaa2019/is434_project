SINGAPORE - Young aspiring footballers from the Tampines and North-East district can get a chance to train under professional football coaches and players soon.
The Tampines Rovers Football Club is working together with the Tampines Grassroot Organisation (GRO) and Northeast CDC, to launch a football academy for those aged between 10 and 16 years.
The youths will also get the opportunity to participate in an overseas training tour and play friendly matches with footballers from Malaysia.
The programme will reach out to needy youth and youth-at-risk in the district. Those from low-income families are eligible to apply for a registration fee subsidy. Their household income should not exceed $2,500 or $700.
Mr Mah Bow Tan, adviser to Tampines GROs, Mayor Teo Ser Luck and Mr Desmond Choo, adviser to Hougang GROs will be taking to the pitch in a friendly match tomorrow at Tampines Stadium.
They will be pitting their skills against participants and big names from the local football scene like Aleksandar Duric from Tampines Rovers Football S League Stars.
