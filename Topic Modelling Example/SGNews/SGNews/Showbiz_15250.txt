You couldn't have had a worse birthday...
Actress Rita Rudaini was all ready to celebrate her 36th birtday on April 11th.
But alas, her day was wrecked, as Utusan Malaysia reported on April 10, that she received an SMS from her husband Aidil Zafuan Abdul Radzak, saying he was filing for a divorce.
Rita had been married to Aidil for four years and has two children.
However, the couple had been living apart since the beginning of the year.
At her birthday party, she put on a brave face at first, saying that she was grateful to her 25-year-old footballer husband for giving her two wonderful children.
"This is destiny" she reasoned, in Malay.
She soon burst into tears at the thought of being away from her children.
"They are everything to me. They are my life," she said in Malay, as she held her youngest son.
She told the press she would do everything to keep them in her care.
Her kids are Airit Rayyan Rizqin, 3, and Airit Rafqa Arjuna, 11 months.
