LONDON - A hosepipe ban was imposed Thursday on millions of British households after one of the driest two-year periods on record.
Householders ignoring the ban face a ?1,000 (S$2,000) fine as water companies across the country grapple with the worsening drought.
Seven suppliers in the south east of England; Southern Water, South East Water, Thames Water, Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East will enforce the restrictions from Thursday.
The ban applies to the use hoses on gardens, plants, cars or boats for "recreational use"; to fill or maintain ponds, pools or fountains; and to clean paths, walls and windows.
Britain suffered a dry March, and, despite recent rain, the south east of England and Yorkshire in the north are officially in a state of drought.
The Environment Agency said river flows were decreasing and reservoir levels were lower than normal.
Peter Simpson, managing director of Anglian Water, explained: "Two dry winters have prevented rivers, reservoirs and aquifers from refilling with the water we treat and supply the rest of the year, especially during the hotter months when demand rises."
Mike Hegarty, operations director at Sutton and East Surrey Water said the company "very much regretted" having to impose the ban but that it had "no choice" due to the increasing seriousness of the drought.
