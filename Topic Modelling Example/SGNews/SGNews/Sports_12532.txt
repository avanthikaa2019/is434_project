Fixing a cupboard at home, what's the worst that could happen?
Well, if you're a goalkeeper, disaster could strike, especially if you cut your thumb in the process. And that's exactly what happened to LionsXII goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud yesterday.
The 22-year-old (above) needed five stitches to his right thumb after a sharp metal tube slipped and cut into his flesh.
How did it happen, Izwan?
"I don't know. I guess I wasn't careful, the cupboard fell, and (the metal tube) just slipped and cut my hand. It's quite a deep cut," he said.
Izwan was accompanied by team physio Majid Khan to Raffles Hospital yesterday afternoon for treatment.
Curiously, the goalkeeper, who will now miss the home match against Sarawak on Tuesday, still attended training at the Jalan Besar Stadium after that, with hand in bandage.
But he did not handle the ball and did only some light running on the sidelines.
"There's no pain," he said. "It's not like a bone or ligament injury. I should be fine by next week, when the stitches come off."
