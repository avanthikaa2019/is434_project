Liu Po-yuan, chairman of gaming operator Gamania, reiterated yesterday his position that the company will not accept what has been called a hostile takeover by South Korean counterpart Nexon.
The two companies will however continue to collaborate in various fields, Liu said during the company's shareholders' meeting.
He made the remarks after Nexon purchased over 30 per cent of Gamania shares, spurring concerns that Gamania's ownership of the company may be in danger.
Liu stressed Gamania will retain its control and leadership, and the company will not accept an integrative effort with Nexon.
However, he emphasized that Nexon is a great partner to work with and said Gamania's distribution of the South Korean firm's products will continue.
Nexon's stake in Gamania has been on the increase over the past few years. When asked why Liu chose to talk about it only now, he said he wasn't at liberty to comment, as the case is now being investigated by the Fair Trade Commission.
"When the case is over I'll talk about it in detail," he said.
As for rumors the firm will lay off a significant number of workers, he said the company conducts merit evaluations every year. Only 20 to 30 people, or less than 3 per cent of Gamania's staff, were affected by the firm's recent downsizing effort, he said.
The company posted earnings per share of NT$1.21 (S$0.05) last year, of which NT$0.8 will be distributed as cash dividends.
