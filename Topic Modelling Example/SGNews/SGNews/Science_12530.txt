Scientists from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have discovered a way to kill cancer cells - by "starving" them of energy.
NUS said in a press statement yesterday that the discovery paves the way for more effective treatment.
The research revolves around a drug-lead compound, BPTES.
The scientists, who are from the Department of Biological Sciences and Mechanobiology Institute, said the compound can deprive cancer cells of energy and stop them from growing into a tumour.
NUS said this is the first time a research group has provided evidence showing how a drug-lead compound suppresses tumour formation.
