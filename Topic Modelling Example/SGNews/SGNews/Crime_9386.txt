SHAH ALAM, Malaysia - A national Sports Council coach was charged at the Sessions Court yesterday with forging 10 cheques worth RM87,900 (S$35, 986) and using them at four banks.
Azizei Fauzi, 23, from Kanowit, Sarawak, was described as a rising star by local media in Sarawak when he broke the 5,000m walkathon record earlier this year.
Azizei claimed trial to 10 forgery charges and 10 charges of using the cheques at four banks in Klang -- Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, Al-Rajhi Banking &amp; Investment Corporation (M) Berhad, Malayan Banking Berhad and RHB Bank Berhad -- between Oct 6 and Nov 3 last year.
Deputy public prosecutor Iswa Tonie offered bail at RM10,000 with one surety.
Counsel S. Devanandan, appearing for Azizei, however, pleaded for a lower bail, saying Azizei was the youngest of four siblings and his parents operated their own business back home.
"Azizei is an athletics coach for the National Sports Council and is based in Sibu, Sarawak, and earns RM600 a month," he said.
Devanandan added his client had also served in the army in Taiping.
Judge Aslam Zainuddin set bail at RM8,000 with one surety and ordered Azizei to surrender his passport. He fixed July 25 for mention.
Meanwhile, in another case, a former manager of a weight loss centre was charged with criminal breach of trust involving RM1,100.
Phuah Shay Li, 29, claimed trial to the offence at the London Weight Management branch at AEON Bukit Tinggi in Klang between 6.25pm and 6.35pm on May 5.
Defence counsel Khairul Mukhtar said: "In this case, there was a misunderstanding between her and her former employer when she wanted to resign."
Phuah was granted bail of RM4,000 with one surety and ordered to surrender her passport. Aslam fixed July 24 for mention.
