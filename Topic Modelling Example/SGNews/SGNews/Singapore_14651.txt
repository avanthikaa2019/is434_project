This Sunday, over 1,200 youths from primary schools, secondary schools, pre-tertiary and tertiary institutions will be coming together to help the less fortunate and "pay-it-forward".
The annual event Youth Hands-On! 2012 will also mark the launch of the Rotary Happiness Fund @ South West, which is the first collaboration between the South West Community Development Council (CDC) and Rotary Club Jurong Town (RCJT).
Over a two year period, the $100,000 fund will seed youth-driven initiatives that foster intergenerational bonds between the elderly, especially the vulnerable and needy elderly, and youths.
Each initiative can be funded up to $5,000.
