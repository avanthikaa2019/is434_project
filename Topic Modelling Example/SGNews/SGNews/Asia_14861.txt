BANGKOK - The graphic image of a naked woman caused shockwaves in Thailand's parliament on Wednesday when it flashed across big screens during a legislators' debate.
Monitors that had been showing a close-up shots of the parliamentarian addressing the house suddenly flashed a picture of a woman of Asian appearance in a provocative pose.
MP Sanong Thepaksornnarong, from Thailand's Bhumjaithai Party, spotted the picture and called for the session to be halted.
Screens were hastily turned off and an investigation was launched.
House speaker Somsak Kiatsuranont said an official told him the picture signal was beamed in from outside parliament by hackers.
Representatives, from both the lower and upper houses, later recommenced their discussion on a controversial constitutional amendment.
