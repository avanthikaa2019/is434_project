Popstar Datuk Siti Nurhaliza Tarudin's sister-in-law, Datin Zaiton Mohd Jiwa has offered a RM100,000 (S$41,060) reward to anyone who can prove her brother's infidelity.
Zaiton's reward is targeted at individuals who can prove that Siti's husband Datuk Seri Khalid Mohamad Jiwa, better known as Datuk K, has taken actress Rozita Che Wan as his wife.
Zaiton told Utusan Malaysia that she does not mind forking out that amount of money to challenge the rumour-mongers and bloggers over the authenticity of their reports.
&ldquo;Step up and come forward. We want proof.
&ldquo;To those who are involved with the spreading of this rumour, we want them to come to us with the evidence, and I will honour my word,&rdquo; she said.
Adding that she was very angry with the blog postings, she said she had to take such drastic measures to ensure that her family's name was not sullied further.
Meanwhile, both Rozita and Khalid have denied a romantic relationship, saying that they have never even met.
