Automation could greatly reduce reliance on low-skilled workers in the construction line, findings from a new facility that officially opened yesterday show.
Called Tiong Seng Prefab Hub, it needs only a third of its workers to produce almost double the tonnage of precast concrete components, by using machines.
In one construction process, the facility managed to use only one man - when it would have usually required 10 without automation - for the job.
A Building and Construction Authority (BCA) spokesman said that with increased automation, companies could rely less on low-skilled foreign workers and instead hire higher-skilled Singaporean workers.
The BCA is also working with the construction industry to build more facilities, such as Tiong Seng Prefab Hub, to increase productivity in the industry.
Beyond raising productivity, the BCA is also working to improve the industry's image to attract more Singaporeans into the sector.
For instance, to encourage more construction-industry employees to upgrade themselves and earn higher wages in the future, the BCA introduced a new scheme last month for Singaporean workers to train them to become supervisors.
Speaking at the opening of Tiong Seng Prefab Hub, Deputy Prime Minister and Manpower Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that improving productivity would benefit workers.
"Productivity gains should...and must be shared with employees, through better wages and career development."
