TAIPEI - Slide it, flip it or snap it on and off. The way keyboards are connected to touchscreens on the latest generation of computing devices is making it tough to differentiate a tablet from a laptop or an ultrabook. Microsoft is set to unveil its Windows 8 operating system later this year, designed to run on super-thin laptops called ultrabooks, and tablets powered by Intel's chips.
The impending launch has prompted PC vendors to unveil a rash of hybrid designs, featuring touchscreens and myriad ways of moving or detaching keyboards. Asustek's Taichi has dual-sided screens that can run different applications at the same time. Samsung Electronics' Hybrid becomes an ultrabook when the tablet clips onto a keyboard with magnetic hinges. Prices for these ultrabook convertibles will not be announced until Windows 8 is released formally, widely expected to be in the fourth quarter.
