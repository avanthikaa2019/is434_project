Local celebrity Nadya Hutagalung is one of the nominees for Most Responsible International Celebrity in the International Green Awards, along with big names like Hollywood actors George Clooney, Penelope Cruz, British designer Vivienne Westwood and Chinese actress Zhou Xun.
The 38-year-old Fly Entertainment artiste, who's the host and judge of upcoming reality TV modelling series Asia's Next Top Model, has been making a name for herself over the years as an eco-activist, an eco-centric jewellery designer and an advocate for sustainable living.
Hutagalung told The New Paper: "The nomination creates such an amazing opportunity to raise awareness of the issues we face not only in Singapore but in South-east Asia on a global stage.
"It is a great honour to be nominated alongside (the others) who are all motivated to use the platform (they have)...
"The motivation to win is really about creating an interest in Asia and all the amazing resources and culture we need to work hard to preserve."
