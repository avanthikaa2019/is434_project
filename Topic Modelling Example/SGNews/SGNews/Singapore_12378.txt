Mr Png Eng Huat said that he was against the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme ever since its introduction.
The candidate from the Workers' Party (WP) has responded to a question from the People's Action Party (PAP) about why he did not take up the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) position last year.
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said in his keynote speech at the People's Action Party's (PAP) rally on Sunday that the WP had not fielded its best man for the Hougang by-election, pointing out that their best man should have been chosen as an NCMP following last year's General Elections.
In a statement to The Straits Times, Mr Png said that he did not wish for a government to dictate the number and type of opposition members the party could have in Parliament.
He added that he had made it clear before the general election to the WP that he did not want to be considered for the NCMP position.
The NCMP scheme was introduced to ensure that Parliament had a minimum number of opposition voices. It was proposed in 1984 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
Critics of the scheme point out that NCMPs cannot vote on constitutional amendments, supply and money Bills, and motions of no confidence in the government.
Last year, the WP was offered two NCMP places for its third and fourth best-scoring constituencies, and picked Yee Jenn Jong and Gerald Giam.
