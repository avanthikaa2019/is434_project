BRASILIA - Police in Brazil have arrested seven people suspected of planning and carrying out the murder of a blogger-reporter in April, the fourth journalist to be killed in the country this year.
Decio Sa, 42, who had written about local corruption in the northeastern Maranhao state, was shot six times at a bar by two men who had arrived on a motorcycle, authorities said at the time of the killing.
Those arrested on Wednesday include a 24-year-old alleged gunman-for-hire suspected in 49 other murders in Maranhao, according to the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo.
Sa's killing was condemned in Brazil and internationally, with UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expressing alarm over "what appears to be a disturbing trend of killing journalists."
Paulo Rodrigues, editor of the Mercosul News website, was shot dead in February by two men on a motorcycle in Ponta Para, in the southern Mato Grosso do Sul state.
A week earlier, Mario Lopes, 50, the editor of the website Vassouras na net - which criticized local politicians, judges and police - was shot dead with his girlfriend in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
And Laercio de Souza, a journalist with Sucesso radio in Camacari, in the northeastern state of Bahia, was also killed.
Three journalists were killed in Brazil in 2011.
