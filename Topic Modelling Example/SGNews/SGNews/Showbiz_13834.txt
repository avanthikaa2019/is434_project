Vicky Donor casts fresh faces Yami Gautam and Ayushmann Khurrana to tell a difficult story incredibly well.
There is much to laugh about as one is introduced to Vicky (Khurrana), who sells his dog, Whiskey, because it failed to bark when there was a burglary in his home.
It is at this time that the observant Dr Chaddha (Annu Kapoo) - who tells us that "shakal dekh ke bande ka sperm pehchaan jaata hun" (by looking at a man's face, I can recognise his sperm) - finds his catch.
There is much laughter as Dr Chaddha convinces Vicky that sperm donation is the right thing to do. As the doctor rationalises: "Vaise bhi toh waste jaa raha hai." (Otherwise it is going to waste.)
Adding to the doctor-donor dynamic is the romantic subplot which happens when Vicky, who is Punjabi, meets the beautiful Bengali bank officer Ashima Roy (Gautam).
In keeping with the times, there is an entertaining Facebook exchange between the two which goes "Hi Fish." and "Hi Butter Chicken."
With a few cultural clashes thrown in as the Punjabi boy goes about trying to marry his dream Bengali bride, the film moves at an entertaining pace till the second half.
