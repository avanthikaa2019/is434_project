KANO, Nigeria - Attackers have carried out assaults on two police stations and a bank in a northern Nigerian town, but it was unclear if there were casualties, residents and authorities said Thursday.
The attackers raided the northeastern town of Bajoga in Gombe state, using guns and bombs, beginning late Wednesday and into early Thursday.
Residents reported a badly damaged regional police station, but details were sketchy.
"There were bombings and gun attacks on the area command and divisional police station in Bajoga town by some gunmen," police spokesman Ahmed Mohammed said.
"They attacked these police facilities with IEDs and assault rifles. There was a shootout between the attackers and the policemen at the facilities."
One resident said the sounds of explosives and rifles were heard during the attack, which lasted until 1:00 am.
"People in the area around the police buildings fled to other parts of the town," he said. "The area has been cordoned off by security personnel."
Residents also reported a bank was attacked and appeared to have been robbed.
The police spokesman said it was not yet clear whether the attackers were members of Islamist group Boko Haram or armed robbers.
Boko Haram has carried out scores of attacks in Nigeria's north as part of an insurgency that has left more than 1,000 people dead since mid-2009, but gangs have also committed crimes under the guise of the Islamist group.
