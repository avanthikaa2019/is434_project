Police arrested North Sumatra legislative councilor Palar Nainggolan of the Democratic Party for gambling at a housing complex in Medan, North Sumatra, on Saturday night, along with three others.
The police said local residents had informed them about the four suspects' activities before officers made the arrests, confiscating a large amount of cash and playing cards from the scene in the process.
The police, however, soon allowed them to go home.
"My friends and I felt like casually playing some cards after playing golf. All of a sudden, the police arrived and raided the place. That is all," Palar said on Monday, as quoted by tempo.co.
"I'm sure that someone had silently tipped the police off about our activities, and that's character assassination."
Gambling is illegal in Indonesia.
Separately, the Jakarta Police said that they had arrested six suspects over the weekend for managing an online gambling website kakakdewa.net with a daily turnover of between Rp 300 million (S$41,444) and Rp 400 million.
The website, which has now been deactivated, encouraged visitors to register and deposit at least Rp 200,000.
Members would then receive a user ID, a password and a personal stash of Rp 1,000 coins, with which visitors gambled at international online betting sites.
