Sex And The City star Kristin Davis is single no more.
After weeks of speculation, the 47-year-old US actress and award-winning US screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, 51, made their rumoured romance official - with a passionate kiss on the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere of the new TV series, The Newsroom, which he created and executive produced.
A source told E! News: "They are really happy. They have actually known each other a while through mutual friends and would sometimes bump into one another at industry events, but it has only just turned into something more."
