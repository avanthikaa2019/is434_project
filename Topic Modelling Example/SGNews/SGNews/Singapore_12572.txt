SINGAPORE - Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports and Chairman (NYC) chaired the second INSPIRIT dialogue in the Singapore Changi Prison Complex on Saturday, May 19.
INSPIRIT is a community of young adult leaders who advocate youth interest on national and community issues and champion youth causes.
Saturday's session involved a learning journey through the prison grounds to provide INSPIRIT members with an understanding of issues such as the social and economic cost of running a prison.
They also witnessed the operations of the prison system and rehabilitation facilities to equip inmates with skills for re-integration upon release.
There were also discussions on the economic opportunities and social support for inmates and their families to help in effective re-integration of the individuals.
INSPIRIT members were encouraged to create action by initiating their own projects, which could be supported by NYC.
