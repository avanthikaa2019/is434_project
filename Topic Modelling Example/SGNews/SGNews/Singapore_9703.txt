SINGAPORE - The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) has rejected Hougang resident Madam Vellam Marie Muthu's conditional offer to withdraw the proceedings in the Hougang by-election case.
According to a statement released today, the condition is for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to issue a statement in Parliament stating that it is the Government's position, based on advice from the Attorney-General, "that when an electoral seat becomes vacant, there is a legal obligation to call a by-election within a reasonable time or within three months".
The AGC said it had replied to Madam Vellama's lawyer, M. Ravi, that it did not accept the conditional offer.
It said "the condition is a hypothetical question and has nothing to do with the Plaintiff's proceedings, which relate specifically to the by-election for Hougang SMC".
The AGC added that it intends to proceed with its application to strike out the proceedings, which have become moot after the calling of the by-election for Hougang SMC in May this year.
"The continuation of the Plaintiff's proceedings is an abuse of the Court process," it said.
On March 2, Madam Vellama, 42, had applied to the courts to declare that the Prime Minister did not have "unfettered discretion" in calling a by-election, and to do so in the constituency within three months or a "reasonable time".
The Straits Times reported in March that in her affidavit, Madam Vellama had indicated that she wanted to have an elected representative of her choice in Parliament so she could get help on issues such as financial struggles.
The AGC had called the application "unarguable in law and fact", and said it was based on an incorrect reading of Singapore's laws.
