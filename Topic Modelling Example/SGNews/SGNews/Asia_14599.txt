AKITA - Rescue workers witnessed a bear climbing over a concrete wall to escape from an open-air play area at the Hachimantai Bear Farm in Kazuno, Akita Prefecture, where two female employees were killed by brown bears Friday, sources said.
Six bears, including the one seen by rescue workers, were killed by local hunters Friday afternoon. They were believed to have escaped from the enclosure, climbing over the 4.5-meter-high wall by climbing up accumulated snow left in a corner of the play area.
The Akita prefectural police found several bear tracks in the snow when they searched the site on Saturday on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in death.
Meanwhile, a male employee who was unharmed admitted to The Yomiuri Shimbun that the farm's employees had not removed any snow from the play area this winter.
According to a local fire station, three rescue workers arrived near the farm's entrance at about 10:30 a.m. on Friday. When they inspected the site based on a report that bears had escaped, they saw a bear climbing over the wall.
The police said the two victims were believed to be Tachi Tatehana, 69, and Take Tatehana, 75, both of the Hachimantai-Sakabitai district of Kazuno.
