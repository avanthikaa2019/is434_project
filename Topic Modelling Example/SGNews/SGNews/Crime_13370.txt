A half-naked woman was seen chasing four men in the early hours of yesterday morning in Clarke Quay.
Shin Min Daily reported that a photo of the woman was taken by a surprised 16-year-old showing the woman naked from waist down.
The woman, who looked like she was in her 20s, was reported to have the clothing on her upper body torn off and her lower body was completely naked.
The report in the Chinese evening daily said she was holding her pants and underwear.
Witnesses told Shin Min that there were not many people around at the time of 5.25am as she chased the four men, ignoring by-standers.
Her friends were also running after her.
When the woman reached the men, they became violent towards her by pushing her to the ground and kicking and punching her, according to witnesses.
She fought back and tried to stand up, using her hands to block her face.
According to The Straits Times, the four men had allegedly stolen from her and assaulted her and two of her friends.
It is believed that an argument broke out between the three women and the group of men.
During the argument, the four men allegedly outraged the modesty of at least two of the women before running off with a mobile phone and wallet belonging to one of them.
Only when witnesses shouted that the police were coming was when they stopped.
Police arrived on the scene and arrested the four men who are currently helping police with investigations.
Three of the men are reported to be in their 20s while one man is in his 30s.
The woman was also reported to have been seen entering a convenience store to buy a drink, while half-naked, earlier.
She is described to have long hair and to have worn a dark-coloured top.
