Lady Gaga was spotted practicing her dance routines with her dance team this week at the fitness center of a hotel in southern Seoul by a hotel guest.
At the aerobics room in a hotel fitness center, on the fourth floor of the hotel, the pop star seemed to be going through the performances she will showcase at the upcoming concert, the witness told The Korea Herald. The hotel's fitness center was renovated in December last year.
Lady Gaga is staying in the hotel's presidential suite on the 17th floor, the most expensive room in the hotel, priced at 4.8 million won ($4,200) per night. Numerous international VIPs including soprano Jo Su-mi and pop star Mariah Carey have stayed in the presidential suite.
The 200-square-meter room has a bedroom, living room, dining room and kitchen as well as a separate meeting room, and is decorated with masterpieces by renowned artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Pablo Picasso.
Several fans were at the lobby on Wednesday, chatting excitedly with one another while hoping to see the pop star.
"We followed her from the airport so we all know that she is here. I actually saw her here on Sunday. I just saw all of her dancers going out for a rehearsal, but her security guard went back up, so we are guessing that she is still upstairs. But it is raining very hard so she might not come down," said 15-year-old Justin Chan.
"I can't go to the concert, so I am here. There were more fans here on Sunday, all under-aged, aged between 12 to 17," he added, showing the photo he took with his star.
He brought a letter, actually two, just in case one fails to reach her, asking if she could do something so that underaged fans could see the concert as well.
