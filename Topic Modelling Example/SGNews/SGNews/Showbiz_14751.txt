There are hints of Arcade Fire and Mumford And Sons stylings on the debut full-length record of this British folk-rock band. The quintet, who are heavily influenced by Americana, sound like they mean every word on robust, heart-pumping songs like The Chambers And The Valves. Be drawn in by the massive chorus on New Ceremony.
It's deliciously melancholic and ambitious and, well, really good.
