Former Singapore Environment Council executive director Howard Shaw is among the four men charged this afternoon (April 18) for sex with an underage girl.
Shaw, 41, is the grandson of Runme Shaw, founder of cinema operator Shaw Organisation.
The other three are Juerg Buergin, 40, a Swiss national who worked for a private bank here; former teacher Chua Ren Cheng, 31 and; Edward Whistler Goh Ngian Meng, 49.
On Monday, 44 men were charged in court for paying for sex with an underage prostitute.
These included a former school principal, military officers and finance industry professionals.
It is estimated that 80 men were called up by authorities last year during investigations over an online vice ring.
Paid sex with a minor carries a jail term of up to seven years and a possible fine.
