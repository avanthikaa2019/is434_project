SINGAPORE - On June 1, between 5.15pm and 5.30pm, a train at Bugis MRT station was held up for some time when a woman's leg became trapped in the gap between the carriage and the platform.
A reader recently sent in pictures to citizen journalism website Stomp showing a woman weeping while at least three fellow passengers try to help her dislodge her leg.
Stomp contributor Manjande said he was alighting at the station when he heard several people screaming.
Curious, he turned back and saw the woman's leg trapped between the platform and the train.
"I called out to the passengers inside the train to press the emergency button," he said.
"I asked the woman to calm down because she was crying. A few children inside the train carriage were also crying," he said.
He added that he is unsure if the woman knew the children. Two women, apparently the woman's friends, were comforting her.
About five minutes later, an SMRT employee came down.
The woman was later released by SMRT staff in about 15 minutes. According to SMRT, she told staff she did not need an ambulance and left unhurt.
