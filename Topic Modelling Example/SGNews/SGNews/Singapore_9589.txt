Singapore's five Community Development Councils (CDCs) have come together to promote social support for the elderly.
The CDCs launched the Caring for the Silver Community initiative yesterday, which will focus on three areas: Promoting an active and healthy lifestyle, strengthening assistance for vulnerable seniors, and developing senior volunteerism.
