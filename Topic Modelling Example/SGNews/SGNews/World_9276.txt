MUNICH - A judge jailed a German banker more than eight years on Wednesday, for taking US$44 million (S$56 million) in bribes during the sale of a stake in Formula One, in a case that centred on payments from the motor sport's commercial chief, Mr Bernie Ecclestone.
Presiding judge Peter Noll convicted BayernLB's former chief risk officer, Gerhard Gribkowsky, of tax evasion, bribery and breach of fiduciary trust in a court in Munich.
Mr Noll described the billionaire Ecclestone as the "driving force" behind the payments but said that Gribkowsky, in turn, had shown "high criminal energy".
Gribkowsky was arrested in January last year over the sale of BayernLB's 48 per cent stake in F1 to British investor CVC, which Mr Ecclestone was keen to see as a new shareholder.
Gribkowsky told the court earlier this month that he received money and a job offer, as part of a secret agreement with the F1 chief in 2005.
Mr Ecclestone was investigated by German prosecutors, but no charges have been filed against the 81-year-old Briton.
He denies any wrongdoing and has said that he was a victim of coercion by Gribkowsky.
When asked about the verdict, Mr Ecclestone told Reuters on Wednesday: "They based their decisions on what he told them. I told them the truth.
"I think Gribkowsky told them what he thought he had to tell them. I don't think I should (face further action) but you don't know, do you?"
He said that the British tax authorities had written to him, within the past two or three months, to say that they were looking into his tax affairs.
"After all of this, I'd be surprised if they didn't contact me," he said, adding that he would cooperate with the inquiry.
Mr Ecclestone, who gave evidence in court in November, has said that he paid some &pound;10 million (S$20 million) to Gribkowsky to "keep him quiet", after the German put him under pressure over his tax affairs, and not to smooth the sale to CVC.
"It's not bribery," Mr Ecclestone said on Wednesday.
