VATICAN CITY - Pope Benedict XVI called Sunday on charities to join the fight against child abuse, singling out an Italian anti-pedophilia group for praise.
"I address my cordial salute in particular to the association Meter, which promotes engagement in favour of child victims of violence," the pope told thousands of worshippers gathered at Saint Peter's Square on a rainy Sunday.
The Catholic community has been rocked by sex-abuse scandals dating back decades, and Meter is a pioneer in Italy in terms of work against abuse by priests.
In an interview with Radio Vatican, Don Fortunato Di Noto, who founded the association, said: "With paternity, firmness and lucidity, this pope is dealing with the problem of sexual abuse."
"In the Church, in all parishes, we cannot remain silent," Di Noto said.
