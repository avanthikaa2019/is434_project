SAN FRANCISCO - Amazon.com will launch new versions of its Kindle e-reader and tablet, including a monochrome e-reader with front lighting, said a source who has seen the prototype.
The world's largest Internet retailer is aiming to have the new e-reader in stores in July, said the source, who has asked not to be named as Amazon has not made the decision public yet.
Amazon has been ramping up production of the new Kindle, which will run on E Ink's display, the source said.
Amazon's Kindle e-reader has been popular, but readers have had to buy an external light to attach to the device to read in the dark. The front light in the New Kindle will eliminate that problem.
"I do see demand for a front-lit Kindle," said Ms Jennifer Colegrove, vice-president of Emerging Display Technologies at DisplaySearch, an NPD Group company, which monitors trends in the display sector.
However, there is a trade-off, she said, as "the front-lighting feature will consume battery power and run out...quicker".
Amazon also plans to launch a new tablet closer to the holiday season later this year, the source said. The new Kindle Fire is expected to have a bigger diagonal display of 8.9 inches, bringing it closer in size to Apple's iPad.
While Barnes &amp; Noble was the first to the market with a glowing e-reader, there has been speculation about Amazon being a close second. Amazon will launch the new Kindle e-reader in the Touch 3G and Touch Wi-Fi versions, it said.
"They can afford to add a front light because the component is not very expensive and their display uses very little energy," said Ms Colegrove.
An increase of about US$10 (S$12) above the current prices should be "quite reasonable", she added.
The source said that Amazon was likely to keep prices the same, or raise them by a very small margin.
