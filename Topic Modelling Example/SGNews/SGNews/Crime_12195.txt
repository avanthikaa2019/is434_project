SINGAPORE - A 42-year-old taxi driver was sentenced to six months' jail on Wednesday for molesting his maid and insulting her modesty, reported The Straits Times.
Chua Chee San admitted to hugging the 24-year-old Indonesian maid from behind in in their Sengkang home in Oct 2010, and exposing himself to her a few months later.
The first incident occurred about two weeks after she had started working for the family.
The maid complained to her female employer, who confronted Chua. He apologised a few days later.
But in Jan 2011, the maid was washing the master bedroom toilet when Chua pulled down his underwear and exposed himself to her.
The maid informed the female employer, who scolded Chua. But in Sept, the maid sent the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) a feedback form, relating the incidents.
The MOM reported the incidents to the police in Oct.
