A foreigner is believed to be the first person to have fallen to his death from the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel, since it opened in June 2010.
The body of the 46-year-old was found on the grass verge in front of the hotel on Tuesday.
The German tourist was said to have fallen from the SkyPark on the 57th floor.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Singapore Police Force received calls for help at 3pm.
When they arrived at the scene, SCDF paramedics pronounced the man "dead on arrival", said an SCDF spokesman.
According to Shin Min Daily News, MBS mobilised more than 10 staff members to cordon off the area. A black tentage was set up to hide the view from passers-by.
An MBS spokesman told my paper that the man was not a hotel guest.
"We are working closely with the authorities," she added.
A police spokesman said: "The police have classified this as an unnatural death, and are investigating. As of now, no foul play is suspected."
The death is the second fatality in three weeks involving a foreigner falling from a hotel building.
A 40-year-old American woman was believed to have plunged from a height of at least 60 storeys, at Swissotel The Stamford, on May 27.
