MANILA - A commercial Philippine plane halted its flight just before takeoff on Thursday after a passenger screamed he would blow up the plane, a civil aviation spokeswoman said.
The offending passenger and six of his relatives and companions were taken off the aircraft and questioned by police after the incident at Manila airport, said civil aviation authority spokeswoman Joy Songsong.
The Air Philippines Airbus A320 was just about to take off from Manila for the tourist island of Palawan when a male passenger screamed, &ldquo;I will blow up this plane,&rdquo; in Filipino, said Songsong.
&ldquo;When he yelled that out... the pilot in command decided to return the plane to the ramp. His group of passengers was held for questioning while the other passengers had to be de-planed,&rdquo; she added.
The plane was then taken away from the terminal and searched but no bomb was found.
Air Philippines senior vice-president Matthew Tamaray said that the man was apparently upset that his companions could not get seats beside him when he made the remark.
The flight to Palawan went through after several hours delay but the man was held in Manila while his companions chose not to board the plane without him, Tamaray told AFP.
Just last week, two bombs went off in popular tourist haunts in Palawan, wounding three people. Two suspects were later held for the crime.
Palawan is a major attraction for both Filipinos and foreign visitors due to its beaches, forests and spectacular rock formations.
