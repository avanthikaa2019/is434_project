NEW YORK - Singer Elton John was treated in hospital in Los Angeles for a serious respiratory infection that forced him to cancel performances this weekend of his "The Million Dollar Piano" show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
In a statement posted on his website on Thursday, the British entertainer, whose hits include "Rocket Man," "Your Song" and"Bennie and The Jets," apologised for the decision and told fans he hoped to be performing soon.
