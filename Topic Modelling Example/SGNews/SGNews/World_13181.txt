RUSSIA - A Russian investigative commission has opened a criminal case pertaining to the crash of a Sukhoi Super Jet 100 during a demonstration flight on Wednesday.
Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said the commission started the investigation into the plane crash on Thursday.
"Researchers need to analyze [the compliance of] aircraft crew training procedures before the flight as part of criminal case investigation, and need to determine the technical condition of the plane before it left Russia," he told reporters.
The investigation would also look into the technicians who prepared the plane for the demo flight and Sukhoi Civil Aircraft employees responsible for the Sukhoi project, he said.
The Russia-made aircraft, which took off from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta, went missing on Wednesday afternoon.
An Air Force helicopter found the wreckage of the crash at 9:15 a.m. on Thursday, at a height of 5,500 feet, in the foothills of Mt. Salak in Cidahu, Sukabumi, West Java.
The plane, which carried 45 passengers during its demonstration flight, was found to have suffered "major damages".
A search and rescue team is expected to start recovering bodies from the crash site today.
