BEIJING - Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang, widely seen as the nation's premier-in-waiting, has urged the country to pursue economic reforms that would push factories up the value chain and reduce wasteful spending, state media reported.
Xinhua quoted Li as saying late on Tuesday that China needs to quicken the development of new strategic manufacturing sectors including energy conservation, environmental protection, bio-industry and high-end equipment.
Li, speaking on a visit to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an influential research institute closely linked to the government, said China needs to let the market play a role in shaping reforms, and warned against wasteful construction projects.
Li's comments are in line with Beijing's plan to restructure the world's second-biggest economy to boost consumption and to reduce state investment and its reliance on a volatile export sector.
Beijing lowered its official target for 2012 gross domestic product growth to 7.5 percent, which would be the weakest since 1990.
But some analysts say China's adjustment to better-quality growth may not be easy because reduced state investment and a shift toward consumption could threaten vested interests such as the giant state-owned firms that thrived under the old system.
