This love story between a gried-stricken widow and an awkward Swede does not have any big laughs, but it does carry some sweet moments.
Nathalie, played by Audrey Tautou, is grieving the death of her husband. While at work, she suddenly throws herself at Markus (Francois Damiens), a Swedish co-worker.
As the drama adopts an increasingly comedic tone, it seems inevitable that Nathalie and Markus will overcome various obstacles.
