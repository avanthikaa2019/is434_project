Four pimps involved in a high-end sex ring of actresses, models, and beauties that has recently rocked Vietnamese showbiz were prosecuted Sunday on charges of providing prostitution services.
They are Miss Vo Thi My Xuan, 27, Tran Quang Mai, 40, Nguyen Huu Dat, 43, and Le Quang Tuan Anh, 27.
Actress Tran Thi H., 24, who is believed to be another of the ring's pimps, has been released on bail due to late-term pregnancy.
Meanwhile, another suspected pimp named Huy has run away in his attempt to escape police arrest.
Previously, on June 2, police conducted surprise raids two big hotels in the city center and caught four high-class prostitutes having sex with their wealthy clients.
The sex workers were later identified as 20-year-old L.T.T.H, an actress, model, and lounge singer; 23-year-old N.T.M.N, a model; 20-year-old L.T.Y.D, a beauty queen in Ben Tre province; and 25-year-old L.T.H.D, a first-year student at a college in Ho Chi Minh City.
The prostitution ring run by Miss My Xuan has not only shocked local showbiz but also grabbed huge attention from global media outlets like MSN News, Times Live, Tengri News, and 21 CN in China, Britishbusinessfinder and BBC in the UK, and VOA (Voice of America), and Singapore's Straits Time, among others.
It has also attracted thousands of comments on social networking sites like Twitter.
