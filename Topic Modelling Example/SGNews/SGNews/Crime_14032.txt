DENPASAR, Indonesia - Two Russians who swallowed hashish capsules face the death penalty after being arrested for suspected drug smuggling on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, an official said Monday.
Yoga teacher Alexander Simonov, 30, was arrested last Tuesday and art designer Sergei Chernykh, 43, was held two days later after arriving on a Malaysia Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur.
"We were suspicious because their stomachs were hard. We then detected hashish capsules in their stomachs after an X-ray scan," head of customs at Ngurah Rai airport, Made Wijaya, told reporters.
He added that two "do not know each other" and are believed to have consumed the hashish in India. Both face the death penalty if convicted.
Simonov had swallowed 88 capsules weighing 915 grammes (32 ounces) while Chernykh had swallowed 359 capsules weighing 695 grammes, Wijaya said, adding that the drugs had a total street value of 966 million rupiah (S$132,300).
Indonesia enforces stiff penalties, including life imprisonment and death, for drug trafficking.
