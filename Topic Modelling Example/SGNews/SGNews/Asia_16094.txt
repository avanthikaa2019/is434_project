TAIWAN - A longtime jobless man and his mentally challenged younger sister hanged themselves in the eastern coastal county of Hualien yesterday.
Their young puppy was found dead inside a car parked next to the shaded pavilion where they took their own lives.
The two are survived by their 78-year-old father, who was beside himself with grief when he identified the two bodies in the morgue.
The deceased man, surnamed Chang, had been unemployed for 10 years and was on medication for depression.
The 45-year-old man and his 42-year-old younger sister had been living off their father's pension.
"They may have become so sick of this world that they took their own lives," the senior Chang conjectured, adding that his son had already threatened to kill himself.
The two bodies were found neatly dressed and wearing new shoes in a park outside Hualien City around 6am yesterday. The were discovered by a woman in her fifties who was there to do exercise.
Police officers who responded to the woman's emergency call found a dead puppy and a slip of paper with a phone number written on it in the sports utility vehicle parked next to the pavilion.
The phone number was the home phone number of the Changs, and the puppy was theirs, too.
Charcoal ashes and kindling materials left on a nearby lawn suggested the two may have suffocated the dog in the car, possibly in an attempt to bring it along to the afterlife.
After the tragedy, Hualien County authorities said they would offer the bereaved father counseling and emergency aid.
Social welfare officials claimed the sister ignored them when they previously asked her to apply for subsistence stipends.
