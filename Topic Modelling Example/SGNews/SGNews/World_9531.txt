ANKARA - A rescue plane sent to find a Turkish fighter jet that had been shot down over the eastern Mediterranean was itself placed in the crosshairs by the Syrian military, a European diplomat told AFP on Monday.
The Turkish army plane was searching Friday for the F4 Phantom jet with two missing pilots onboard before it was targeted by a Syrian ground-to-air defence system, said the diplomat.
"When a plane is targeted by such a defence system, the pilots are warned by their instruments that they are targeted," added the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the plane was not shot at, he noted.
The source was not able to say if the plane was in Syrian or international airspace.
On Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu briefed diplomats from EU and NATO member states about the incident.
Turkey, a former ally of Syria, called for an emergency NATO meeting Tuesday after accusing Damascus of shooting down its jet in international airspace.
Rescue teams are still searching for the wreckage of the plane shot down by Syria, 1,300 metres underwater in Syrian waters. Turkish diplomatic sources said it was still unclear if the pilots had ejected and the search was continuing.
