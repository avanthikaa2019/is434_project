Five Community Development Councils (CDCs) have targeted to raise awareness and engage the community in enhancing social support programmes for seniors.
Under a new initiative that was launched on Sunday morning, three key areas were identified in which the CDCs can reach out to less active seniors.
They aim to promote an active and healthy lifestyle, strengthen assistance for vulnerable seniors and encourage more senior volunteers.
In all, they aim to reach out to about 114,000 seniors aged above 50 by March 31 next year, according to The straits Times.
The CDCs will lead in facilitating and supporting community programmes to widen outreach and better meet the needs of seniors in the community.
Dr Amy Khor, Chairperson of the Mayors' Committee and Mayor of South West District, said a recent focus group discussion affirmed the need to read out to less active seniors.
She said: "The focus group also concluded that vulnerable seniors have different profiles and specific needs."
The experience of able and healthy seniors could also be harnessed to help the less able, she added.
One of the initial outcomes of the discussion is the creation of a checklist to make community events 'elder friendly', she added.
