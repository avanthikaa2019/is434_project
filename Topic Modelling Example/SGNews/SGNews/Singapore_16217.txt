Give the Rail Corridor back to the wild, with an elevated trail running through it, or bring communities together through farming.
These are among the winning ideas in a competition on what to do with the former railway land which stretches from Woodlands to Tanjong Pagar.
The 26km-long strip of land was used by Malaysia's KTM trains till it was returned to Singapore last July.
The "Journey of Possibilities" competition, launched last November, drew more than 200 ideas from Singapore and all over the world, of which 18 in six categories were picked as top ideas.
The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), which organised the competition, awarded prizes to winners in a ceremony yesterday.
An Australian team picked up one of the top prizes with its submission titled "The Tiger's Garden", proposing that the Rail Corridor be returned to the wild. The jury said the proposal went beyond the concept of a city in a garden to conceive of Singapore as a city in a jungle.
An exhibition of the winning entries and honourable mentions will be held at the URA Centre Atrium, 45 Maxwell Road, till May 11.
The centre is open Mondays to Fridays, 8.30am to 7pm, and on Saturdays, 8.30am to 5pm. It is closed on Sundays and public holidays. Admission is free.
