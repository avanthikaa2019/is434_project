HONG KONG - Football fans in China will be able to see 3D computer recreations of all goals scored in the European championships on their mobile phones, the China mobile and TV service provider WASU and Agence France-Presse (AFP) announced Wednesday.
"We are making this AFP service available to China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom subscribers," WASU chief executive Li Yiqing said. "This will be another way for them to enjoy this hugely popular sport in China," she said.
The three Chinese providers combined have more than one billion subscribers. Under terms of the agreement signed by WASU New Media Network and AFP, AFP's German-based partner, Impire AG, will reproduce and supply high-definition computer graphics of all goals scored from three angles.
Once the championship kicks off on Friday, the service will be available to subscribers on the three mobile networks within two hours of the end of each match.
"The idea is to have soccer fans enjoy and appreciate the intricacies of each goal scored," AFP's Asia-Pacific regional director, Eric Wishart, said.
"We are delighted to be working with WASU in bringing this very special news product to soccer fans in China," he said.
WASU is also offering subscribers AFP's video coverage of cultural and other activities organised in conjunction with Euro 2012 in the tournament's various host cities in Poland and the Ukraine, all with subtitles in Chinese.
AFP is fielding a team of some 60 football writers, photographers and others to provide comprehensive text, still photo, video and graphics coverage of the tournament, which ends on July 1.
