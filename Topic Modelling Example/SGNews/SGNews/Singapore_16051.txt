A controversial party to be held at Chijmes this Saturday has been called off.
After a one-hour closed-door meeting between the management of Chijmes and organisers of the Escape Chapel Party, it was decided that the party will be nixed, reported The Straits Times.
The meeting between Perennial (Singapore) Retail Management, which manages Chijimes and event organiser Creative Insurgence was called last night, said the paper. Perennial had told the organiser that it would face legal action if it did not cancel the party.
The party, which was to be held on Black Saturday, had raised eyebrows due to the provocative images used to promote it. In one image, two young women were dressed in skimpy nun-like habits. While habits normally cover the whole leg, the outfits the women wore were shorter than mid-thigh length.
It was posted on the Facebook page, with the caption "A sneak peek at what some of our girls will be wearing on the 7th of April."
The page also featured an event poster, with a woman also dressed in a habit-like outfit.
In an earlier my paper report, Archbishop Nicholas Chia of the Catholic Church in Singapore said that the event "is scandalous to the Church" and that "such events should not be held in a chapel".
Chijmes, which was established in 1854, was previously the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus before a $100-million restoration project transformed it into a lifestyle destination in 1996.
According to the my paper report, Creative Insurgence's director, Mr Aaghir Yadav, said they had taken down the images and apologised to the Catholic church.
He also said the women in the photos are friends of his in cosplay costumes. He denied that there was any religious symbolism in the photos. Mr Yadav also claimed that the party was named because of its location, Chijmes.
Chijmes' management, however, has said that it strongly disapproves events held there that are 'illegal and immoral in nature and/or disrespectful of religions, faiths and races'.
