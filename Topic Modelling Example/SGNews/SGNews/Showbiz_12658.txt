What's better than this American's laidback brand of beachcomber folk-rock?
Him enlisting the help of famous buddies (from Dave Matthews to Ziggy Marley) to rock out at Hawaii's Kokua Festival which supports environment education.
Live sounds good on Johnson, who seems liberated, especially on soulful songs such as Cry, Cry, Cry. Chilled-out bliss.
Best Of Kokua Festival (Universal)
