GENEVA - One person was injured when a coach carrying 73 passengers burst into flames Wednesday close to southern Switzerland's Gotthard tunnel, the tour bus's firm said.
The driver noticed smoke emerging from the engine in time and stopped the bus along the emergency lane of the motorway to evacuate passengers onboard, said the tour company Zerzuben Touristik in a statement.
But one person was injured while leaving the two-storey vehicle and had to be hospitalised.
The bus was carrying Swiss passengers returning from a cruise in the Mediterranean when it caught fire at around 1515 GMT, added the firm.
Local media said the fire forced the motorway shut and completely destroyed the bus.
