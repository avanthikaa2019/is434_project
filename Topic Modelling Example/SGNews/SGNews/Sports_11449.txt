ROME - Former Italy striker Luca Toni was struck by tragedy on Friday as his child was stillborn, Italian media reported.
Toni, who now plays in Dubai, and model girlfriend Marta Cecchetto were expecting their first child.
"What should have been the best day of our lives has become the worst," said Toni in a brief statement.
"Our child has left us before seeing the light of day. We ask everyone for understanding and silence during this great pain, which should be only mine and Marta's."
Toni won the World Cup with Italy in 2006 and the German title with Bayern Munich two years later in a glittering career.
