More than 1,600 people died in Tokyo and nine prefectures for reasons related to, but not as a direct result of, last year's Great East Japan Earthquake, according to the Reconstruction Agency.
Of the 1,618 people who died for disaster-related reasons as of March 31, Fukushima Prefecture topped the list with 764, followed by Miyagi Prefecture with 636 and Iwate Prefecture with 179. The three prefectures were hit hardest in the March 11, 2011 disaster.
Ibaraki Prefecture came in fourth with 29 people while three people died in each of Chiba and Nagano prefectures. Tokyo and three other prefectures--Yamagata, Saitama and Kanagawa--each reported one death from reasons associated with the disaster.
No specific criteria have been set to determine disaster-related deaths, but the 1,618 include people who died because they could not receive proper medical treatment after being forced to evacuate and those whose chronic diseases worsened while they were living in temporary housing. Suicides are also included in the number.
According to the National Policy Agency, the number of people who were killed or remain missing in the disaster was 18,914 as of Wednesday. This figure does not include those who died from reasons not directly related to the disaster.
Municipal governments tallied death tolls as of late March based mainly on the number of people who died from disaster-related injuries and whose families became eligible for condolence money.
After the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, out of 6,402 deaths in Hyogo Prefecture, 919 people were recognized as having died from quake-related reasons during a 10-year period after the disaster.
At a press conference after a Cabinet meeting Friday, Reconstruction Minister Tatsuo Hirano said, "We're working hard to keep survivors alive. We take [the figure] seriously."
"We'll investigate the cause of their deaths and step up measures [to prevent further deaths among] people in temporary housing," he added.
