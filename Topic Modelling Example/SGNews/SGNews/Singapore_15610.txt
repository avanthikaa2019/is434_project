SINGAPORE - StarHub apologised on Sunday for their controversial expats-only Uefa Euro Cup 2012 promotion that offered freebies worth $50 for every sign-up.
The expats-only promotion that began at the start of April was targeted at fans from England, France, Germay, Netherlands and Spain.
They were targeted through their clubs and association publications.
In their apology StarHub explained that they were targeting expats because "UEFA EURO 2012&trade; involves competing European nations, and they anticipated strong rivalry and enthusiasm among the expatriate community in support of their respective countries."
The promotion that ruffled the feathers of many local netizens is now open to the first 2000 sign-ups of any nationality.
The first 2000 who sign up the for the promotion will now be eligible to receive a travel bag, a mug, a portable fan and a six-can cooler bag.
StarHub also issued an apology on Facebook saying, "We take customer feedback very seriously and we now realised that we scored an own goal. We deserve a red card for this."
Their Facebook apology had some fans voicing their disappointment. Mr Ian Goh said, "I think most people are angry because it was done in bad taste or gave the feeling that locals are second-rated in their own country."
While Mr Jason Ong said that the apology and explanation was weak as the promotion will not cater to European expats who are now Singaporeans.
The local telco also said that while they recognise that they are a "home-grown company" they have "targeted promotions to different customer groups based on their unique needs and interests. These groups range from youths to senior citizens to families to expatriates."
