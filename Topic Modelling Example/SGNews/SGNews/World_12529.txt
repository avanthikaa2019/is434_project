CAMP DAVID, Maryland - G8 leaders expressed "deep concerns" Saturday at the "provocative actions" of North Korea and united in condemnation of its botched test last month of a long-range missile.
"We urge the DPRK to comply with its international obligations and abandon all nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner," said a joint statement after a summit near Washington.
"We affirm our will to call on the UN Security Council to take action, in response to additional DPRK acts, including ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests," said the statement.
The secretive communist state has alarmed the international community by testing two nuclear bombs and hinting it may conduct a third explosion.
Young leader Kim Jong-Un's regime said it would suspend nuclear and missile tests along with uranium enrichment under a February 29 deal with the United States.
But the agreement quickly collapsed after North Korea launched a rocket on April 13 in what US officials say was a disguised, albeit unsuccessful, missile test.
In Saturday's statement, G8 leaders also expressed concern about North Korean human rights violations, including abductions and the situation of political prisoners.
