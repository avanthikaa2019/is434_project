TAIPEI - A popular web trend tool of Google Inc. can now predict the winners of the Golden Melody Awards, the biggest music awards event in the Chinese-language world, according to Google.
Google Taiwan said this week that its Google Insights for Search, a service that provides a visual representation of top Google searches in different parts of the world, accurately predicted many of last year's award winners.
Many of the winners in 2011 were the No. 1 searches in their respective categories.
For example, Best Mandarin Male Singer Jay Chou, Best Band Matzka, Best Singing Group Da Mouth and Best Newcomer Wei Li-an, said the company.
The discovery was made after analyzing search results from June 2010 to May 2011 on the web tool.
The Golden Melodies last year was held in June.
This year, Jay Chou and Hebe Tien from the Taiwanese girl group S.H.E have so far been the top searches in the Best Mandarin Male and Female Singer categories, respectively, said the company.
The awards ceremony, now in its 23rd year, will be held at the Taipei Arena June 23.
