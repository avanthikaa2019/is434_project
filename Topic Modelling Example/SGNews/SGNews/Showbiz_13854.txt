When LOUD got on the phone with YouTube star David Choi last month, he was crossing the US-Canada border on his way to a show in Toronto.
Sounding a little tired, Choi said he was missing "sunlight, my bed and my dog".
"It's tough, you know. You're doing the same thing every day," he said. "We try and squeeze in some fun. We watched The Hunger Games at amall."
"We (the band) haven't killed each other yet, though, which is a good thing."
He's excited to be back in Singapore for the YouTube Stars Concert this Saturday at The Coliseum, Hard Rock Hotel.
The concert also features other YouTubers: Joseph Vincent, Jason Chen, Tiffany Alvord, Ana Free and home-grown singer Clarence Liew.
It'll be Choi's third time performing for fans here.
"I hated the humidity the first time around," he said. "But I love the cleanliness. I'm a little OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder). Singapore is spick and span. I like that."
The Singaporean connection continues with his collaboration with indie musician Inch Chua, who has been in the US since March, working on expanding her career there.
"We started hanging out, became friends," he said. "She's a really cool girl, very talented." Has he given her any advice on how to break into the US market?
"Well, it's tough even for an American," said Choi. "But if the stars align, she has a shot."
In addition to touring, Choi has been busy putting the word out about his new album, Forever and Ever.
"I think my style has changed quite a bit. In the latest album, I experiment with a lot of different sounds, style of writing and topics," he said.
