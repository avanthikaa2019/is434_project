BUENOS AIRES - Striker Carlos Tevez insisted Wednesday he would not apologise to Sir Alex Ferguson after waving a mocked-up tombstone of the Manchester United boss during Manchester City's Premier League title celebrations.
"It seems that Ferguson is the president of England. Because each time that he speaks badly of a player or talks nonsence about me no-one comes out to say that he has to apologise.
"When you make a joke, you have to apologise. But I'm not apologising," said Tevez on returning to Buenos Aires after helping City to their first title in 44 years.
The 28-year-old Argentina striker held up a banner designed to look like a gravestone and bearing the words 'RIP Fergie' as City celebrated their title triumph over Manchester United during an open-top bus parade.
Manchester City later released a statement apologising to Ferguson and criticised Tevez while the player - who it is believed took the banner from a fan - also said he "didn't mean any disrespect".
Argentina's Pablo Zabaleta scored City's opening goal in their 3-2 defeat of QPR with compatriot Sergio Aguero netting the winner.
"It was an honour to be with Pablo and 'Kun' (Aguero) and to walk away champions, more so with the problem that we have with England," added Tevez, concerning the dispute between the two countries over the Falkland Islands.
Tevez revealed that he had just been about to go to the locker room when Edin Dzeko got the equaliser two minutes into extra time, explaining: "I stayed and then came Kun's goal and the madness broke out".
