SEREMBAN - In a desperate bid to escape the authorities, a foreign guest relations officer (GRO) jumped off the second floor of an entertainment outlet in Rasah on Wednesday and ended up spending more than an hour on a compressor unit of an air-conditioner.
The woman from China, in her 30s, is believed to possess a passport identifying her as an engineer.
She was later rescued by firemen who used a rope from the roof of the premises to lower her down.
Earlier, 13 GROs had tried to hide on the roof before they were nabbed by the authorities.
One of them tried to jump off the roof, but backed out and climbed down to hide on the compressor unit instead.
However, she was soon discovered by a team from the state Immigration Department, led by director Faizal Fazri Othman, during a raid on three entertainment outlets in the district.
Forty-seven women from China and Vietnam, aged between 18 and 45, were detained for various offences under the Immigration Act.
Faizal said the majority of them were found to have abused their social visit passes.
"They have been sent to the Lenggeng detention depot pending further action."
