SINGAPORE - An early morning shift left an unsuspecting cabby with deep wounds on his arm after passenger went on slashing rampage.
The CityCab taxi driver, only known as Mr Tan, 58, picked up the male passenger at around 6.20am in Telok Blangah. He asked to go to Jurong West, reported Shin Min Daily News on Sunday.
When they arrived at the destination, Mr Tan stopped near a waste collection centre at the foot of a HDB block.
As he stopped the meter and turned around to collect the fare, the passenger took out a weapon and started to attack him.
"It happened so quickly, and it was still dark. I couldn't see what weapon he was using," said Mr Tan.
"When I tried to retaliate, he attacked me again."
As the attacker did not take any valuables, the driver believes he had no intention of robbing him.
Residents reportedly heard shouts in the area.
One resident reportedly saw the attacker fleeing from the scene.
It is believed that the taxi driver tried to give chase on foot, leaving a 20-metre blood trail.
Blood stains were also seen on the right door and window of the taxi.
Police have confirmed the case and are currently investigating.
Shin Min reported that the police combed the area for about five hours, but to no avail.
So far, no one has been arrested.
ComfortDelGro group, which runs the CityCab fleet, said it will render assistance to the driver.
Mr Tan is currently warded at the National University Hospital.
He said the nerves in his left arm have been damaged and he requires surgery. He also said he may quit driving.
