MELBOURNE - Former champion Chris Hoy progressed to the second round of the keirin as title holder Shane Perkins crashed out at the world track cycling championships on Sunday.
Four-time Olympic champion Hoy, who took bronze in the men's sprint on Saturday, dominated his heat to advance to round two, from where he will hope to make the final later Sunday.
Only the winner from each of the six first-round heats goes directly to the second round, the remainder being forced into repechages.
Joining Hoy as winners in their first round were Yudai Nitta and Kazunari Watanabe of Japan, Hodei Mazquiaran of Spain, Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia and Australian Scott Sunderland.
Hoy's British teammates Matthew Crampton and Jason Kenny both had to come through repechages, but won their respective heats to advance to the second round.
France's Mickael Bourgain won his repechage heat, as did Venezuela's Hersony Canelon, New Zealand's Simon Van Velthooven and Germany's Maximilian Levy.
Among the big names to fail to make the second round were Frenchman Francois Pervis, Perkins, of Australia, and the Dutchman Teun Mulder.
