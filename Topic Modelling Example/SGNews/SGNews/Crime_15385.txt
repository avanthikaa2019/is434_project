JOHOR BARU - A syndicate which made thousands of ringgit in profits by duping foreigners into taking part in the Immigration Department's 6P registration programme was busted during a raid at a premises in Ulu Tiram by the Johor Immigration Department.
During the raid conducted by the enforcement division, three suspects aged between 20 and 21, including a woman, were arrested along with an Indonesian with a permanent resident's status.
The raid also led to the discovery of 524 files on the 6P registration programme which would purportedly be sent to the Immigration Department for processing.
During the raid, three Indonesians who had come to the premises for the registration exercise were also arrested to help in the investigation.
Deputy assistant director II Amzari A. Jalil, who led the operation, said the three Indonesians had just received approval letters for their registrations which cost them RM300 (S$123).
He said the raid was conducted following undercover works by the department to confirm the existence of the syndicate after the department received information from the public.
The syndicate is believed to have duped foreigners by offering to help them in their neutralisation programme with charges up to RM2,000.
"The clients are made to make payment for the processing of the documents and they would be called for finger-printing process at an Immigration Department office at a later date.
"Investigations are still ongoing as we are suspicious of the validity of the company's activities," said Amzari.
During the raid, the department also seized three computers and files on application for the 6P programme.
