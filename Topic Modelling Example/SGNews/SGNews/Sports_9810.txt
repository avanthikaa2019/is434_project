Jeremy Lin is delighting fans again, with the NBA honoring him with The EPIC Award and The Snap Shot Award at the NBA Social Media Event yesterday.
Streamed live from a studio, hosts Shaquille O'Neal and Rick Fox presented the award with wit and style, and even a little jazz dancing, as they announced the nominees.
Taiwanese fans relived that epic night of Feb. 12 when Linsanity stormed the Madison Square Garden, driving fans wild as they watched Jeremy Lin granted the Lakers a much-astonished loss with his 38-point performance.
Shaq announced the winner with much enthusiasm as Rick Fox chanted repeatedly "Lin, Lin, Lin" in the studio.
The much deserved point guard, Jeremy Lin was later connected with the hosts by phone from Palo Alto in commenting on his achievements.
Among the contenders were Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook.
When the hosts asked Jeremy Lin if he missed Linsanity, the appreciative point guard said that he missed playing basketball due to a knee injury , missed teamwork, and was eager to get back on court for better achievements.
He also said that he keeps in touch with the fans through Twitter and social media by posting little bits of his life.
The picture of the couch that Jeremy Lin slept on was also awarded the Snap Shot award, which according to the announcers was "no surprise."
The hosts congratulated Lin again, stating "Linsanity continues."
When Shaq asked Jeremy Lin about his coaching skills for the All-Star NBA east team, Lin jokingly responded, "No, we lost."
Shaq disagreed by pointing out Jeremy Lin being prima donna for not playing in the game. According to his Twitter, Jeremy Lin exploded the web by gaining 1.73 million followers in 2012.
