The equipment for the ballet performance scheduled to take place at the Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPac) this weekend, has been returned to the dance company in Singapore.
"We did not have a choice but to cancel the show as it is too late to wait for the permit," said KLPac marketing manager Malik Taufiq.
He said the dancers were supposed to have arrived in Malaysia last Tuesday but they had not been issued a permit for the show by then.
"We have already returned the dance equipment to the company," he said when contacted yesterday.
An online portal reported on Wednesday that the Ballet Illuminations show by the Singapore Dance Theatre had not been issued a permit due to "indecent" costumes.
Information, Communications and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim, however, refuted the report on Twitter, adding that no application for permit had been made.
He "strongly urged" for the ballet performance to be held here.
Later, he clarified that KLPac had only sent the application to the ministry's Central Agency for Application for Filming and Performance by Fo-reign Artistes (Puspal) on Thursday.
But KLPac executive producer and co-founder Datuk Faridah Merican said the required documentation had been submitted personally by KLPac production manager Freddy Tan on March 7.
She said Tan was advised on March 28 that the application was rejected due to reasons of "costuming" and "foreign performers".
Meanwhile, Puspal issued a statement saying there were doubts on the authenticity of documents submitted for the show.
It said the doubts arose because the account number for receipt of the documents submitted by KLPac was the same as one issued two years ago.
