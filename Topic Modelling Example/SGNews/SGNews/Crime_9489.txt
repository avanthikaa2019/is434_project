A Washington state woman who has studied martial arts for nearly two decades said she fought off two teenage boys who accosted her while she was jogging.
Priscilla Dang, 23, of Vancouver said she was jogging on the path along Padden Parkway June 14 when a teenage boy on a bicycle distracted her to allow a second teenager to swat her on the buttocks, The Columbian in Vancouver reported Monday.
"I hate when men think they can do that stuff," said Dang, who said she regularly studies Wushu martial arts. "There was no question."
Dang said she threw the boy to the ground and demanded an apology, which he offered, but the other boy called her a derogatory term and she struck him, leading him to get off his bicycle and attempt to punch her.
The jogger said the teenager pulled out a knife when he was unable to land a punch and she blocked his weapon with the bicycle until a passerby spotted the confrontation and called 911.
Sheriff's deputies arrested Josiah Sullivan, 18, who allegedly slapped Dang's buttocks, on suspicion of misdemeanour fourth-degree assault.
Deputies referred charges of displaying a dangerous weapon against the second teen, a 16-year-old boy whose name was not released.
