TAIPEI - Taiwan's HTC Corp. said yesterday that it will offer repair services for users with Wi-Fi connectivity problems in its One X flagship smartphone following media reports that some consumers have complained about the issue.
According to recent reports, some users have said on Internet forums that they have found a bug that prevents the One X from reliably connecting to Wi-Fi signals.
The affected users ascribed the problem to a hardware issue rather than a software issue because if they hold the phone in a certain way, they can obtain an improved signal, the reports said.
In an email reply to CNA, HTC acknowledged the problem and apologized for any inconvenience caused to users while it conducts further investigation.
"After investigating isolated reports of Wi-Fi connectivity issues in the HTC One X, we have identified a fix that strengthens the area of the phone around the Wi-Fi antennae connection points," the Taoyuan-based company said.
"While many customers have not experienced any problems with signal strength, we have taken immediate steps to implement a solution in our production process to prevent this issue from happening in the future," it added.
HTC is not the only big name to have faced antenna problems in recent years.
In 2010, Apple Inc. found itself with a similar problem with its iPhone 4.
Dubbed "antenna-gate," the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs described the issue as "a challenge for the entire industry," saying that every phone has weak spots.
In February this year, Apple agreed to compensate iPhone 4 users over the antenna issue, offering them a US$15 (S$19) refund or a free bumper case, but only for customers in the United States.
