International movie star Michelle Yeoh was awarded the Darjah Seri Paduka Mahkota Perak, which carries the title 'Datuk Seri', during the investiture ceremony in conjunction with the Sultan of Perak Sultan Azlan Shah's 84th birthday on Tuesday.
Yeoh said she was surprised when she heard the news and flew back from Bangkok, where she was shooting a film, to attend the ceremony at Istana Iskandariah in Kuala Kangsar.
"I was filming in Thailand when I got a call from my mother (Datin Janet Yeoh).
"She excitedly told me to be back today to receive the award," said the Ipoh-born actress when met at the ceremony.
Michelle said she was delighted and honoured by the award.
Recounting the moment as she walked up to receive the award from Sultan Azlan Shah, she said: "I was really nervous as I did not attend the rehearsals.
"The palace official said to me 'Datuk, walk slowly' and that made me laugh," she said.
