Indonesians seem to have become trigger-happy. Police officers, soldiers and civilians have been pulling out guns and shooting at an alarming rate, raising the question of just how many firearms are out there and what can be done to take them off the streets, Jakarta Globe reported.
Mr Neta S Pane, from Indonesia Police Watch (IPW), told the newspaper that the increasing use of firearms was a symptom of the police's inability to guarantee a sense of security, as well as arrogance among firearm users.
He said civilians had easy access to firearms during the reform era (after the fall of Suharto)when the police, unable to ensure security, began to issue gun permits to people, including public figures and businessmen. The practice ended in December 2006.
According to IPW, the police issued about 17,000 permits for firearms, with 8,000 of them in Jakarta.
Mr Neta also claimed that there are about 8,000 firearms without permits, or which are otherwise circulating illegally in Jakarta.
He said they could be bought illegally for between three million rupiah (S$405) and 25 million rupiah.
