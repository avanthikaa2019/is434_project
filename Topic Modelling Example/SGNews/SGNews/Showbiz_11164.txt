Chinese singer-songwriter Faye Wong is watching every move that her eldest daughter Dou Jingtong makes after discovering that she has been patronising nightclubs, China Press reported .
The 15-year-old, from Wong's first marriage to Dou Wei, studies in Shanghai while Wong lives in Beijing.
It was reported that Jingtong, better known as Tong Tong, used to be a tomboy when she was younger.
Wong spent years trying to make her more feminine.
However, Tong Tong does not get along with her stepfather Li Yapeng and was sent to study in Shanghai.
After discovering that Tong Tong had been going to nightclubs, Wong immediately arranged for her to return to Beijing and study at the same school as her younger sister, Li Yan, six.
