SHAH ALAM: Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) deputy president Tan Sri Annuar Musa, who is currently on a 30-month suspension from state and national-level football activities, has filed a suit against the association.
The originating summons, filed on June 5, named the association as the first defendant and its secretary-general Datuk Azzudin Ahmad as the second defendant.
Annuar is seeking a declaration that the first two charges against him - as stated in a letter by the association's disciplinary committee dated March 16 - were flawed, invalid and void.
He claimed that the association also failed to satisfy the burden of proof on the charges against him in a disciplinary hearing held on April 4.
Annuar claimed that the charges against him were prejudicial as he was found guilty of violating the FAM Edisi 2011 code before his defence was filed and before the hearing, hence the defendants failed to adhere to proper procedure. He also claimed that he was not given the right to be represented during the hearing.
Annuar further sought an injunction to stop the defendants from preventing him from carrying out his duties as the association's deputy president.
He also sought costs and other relief deemed fit by the court.
Annuar allegedly breached FAM's Article 88 by making a negative statement on the national football team on Feb 12. Article 88 states that only the president and secretary-general can comment on the team's performance.
He was also charged with not adhering to FAM deputy president Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah's directive that all matters related to FAM should not be aired through the media.
The suit is fixed for case management on Tuesday.
