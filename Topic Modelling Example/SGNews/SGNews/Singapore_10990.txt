SINGAPORE - Former Singapore Civil Defence (SCDF) chief Peter Lim Sin Pang allegedly had sex twice with one of the women in his own home.
He stands accused of having obtained sexual gratification from three women between May 2010 and last November in exchange for favouring their companies during IT-related tenders held by the SCDF.
In the Tanjong Rhu apartment, Lim, who is married, allegedly had sex with then NCS director of business development Ester Goh Tok Mui.
The 16th floor Costa Rhu condominium unit is served by private lifts from the basement car park and ground floor, The Straits Times reported.
Other than his own apartment, Lim is said to have engaged in sexual trysts with Goh in public places such as at various car parks and three times in a Clementi flat.
Lim, who was charged with 10 counts of corruption on Wednesday, also engaged in oral sex with Pang Chor Mui, a general manager at Nimrod Engineering, at a carpark near the Singapore Indoor Stadium; and sex and oral sex with Lee Wei Hoon, a director at Singapore Radiation Centre a carpark at Big Splash in East Coast Park and in a hotel in Paris.
NCS and Nimrod were awarded contracts by SCDF while SRC is believed to have been a potential vendor.
Two of them are in their 40s and married, and all three held senior positions in their companies. Goh, who is unmarried, is the only one who is no longer working for her former company.
All outstanding tenders that involve Lim have been suspended and two contracts signed with the companies are currently under review by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
MHA said that the people believed to be involved in the case are no longer servicing the SCDF accounts.
Lim, who is a government scholar, is currently out on bail of $10,000 and faces a jail term of up to five years and a fine of $100,000 for each charge.
