Yala police chief Maj-General Peera Boonliang confirmed yesterday that police had arrested three suspects allegedly involved in a car-bombing in downtown Yala on March 31.
But he warned the public that three stolen cars may also be used for another attack.
Some 11 people were killed and about 100 others injured after two car bombs exploded on Ruam Mit Road on March 31, Peera told a press conference yesterday. Police inquiries had led to the arrest of three suspects, but the details were still confidential pending further investigation and the gathering of more evidence.
He also urged more witnesses who remember the person that parked the car with the bomb before fleeing on a motorcycle to come forward to give information to police.
He also urged people to watch out for a grey Toyota Corona sedan, a black Isuzu D-max pick-up and a six-wheel truck, as they were stolen and may be used in further blasts.
In related news, a five-kilogram home-made bomb was set off yesterday by mobile phone at around 2pm near a road leading to Narathiwat Airport. No one was injured but a nearby billboard and a tree were damaged. The bomb created a hole about 30cm deep and 60cm wide. Police believe the blast was part of insurgent activities in the far South.
