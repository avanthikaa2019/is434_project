Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Mr Lim Swee Say on Saturday encouraged newly commissioned Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) officers to develop a sense of mission and purpose in their men and to lead by example.
Reviewing the parade where 303 cadets were commissioned at the SAFTI Military Institute, Mr Lim emphasised the important role that SAF officers play as commanders in inspiring their troops.
"Spare no effort when training your men and women but never compromise on performance standards.
"Most of all, always have their safety at heart," he said.
Mr Lim also encouraged the new officers to always strive to execute their missions successfully, whether in training or in exercises.
This cohort of graduands includes 273 Army and 30 Air Force officer cadets.
The newly commissioned officers will go on to assume command, instructional or staff appointments in the SAF after completing 38 weeks of rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School.
Members of Parliament, senior Ministry of Defence officials and SAF officers, as well as families and friends of the newly commissioned officers were also present at the parade.
