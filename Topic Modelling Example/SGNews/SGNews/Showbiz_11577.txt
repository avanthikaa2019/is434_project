Female lead Virginie Efira plays Joanna, an independent-minded woman who falls in love with Julien, a relationship coach (played by Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Demaison).
The two are clearly a good fit and want to be together, except that Julien has a history of bringing serious bad luck to every girl he has dated.
The question for the movie audience, however, is how long can they stand the string of sexual misunderstandings a la American Pie (1999) and awkward situations in the style of Meet The Parents (2000), before realising that they have seen them all before?
