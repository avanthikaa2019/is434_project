JOHOR BARU - A foreigner is believed to be the mastermind behind the drug lab discovered at a frozen foods factory in Pekan Nenas, Pontian here.
Johor police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Mohd Mokhtar Mohd Shariff said police had identified several suspects.
"We have yet to arrest anyone or record any statement but we already know who are involved and it will be just a matter of time before we nab them," he said at the state police monthly assembly here yesterday.
The lab was uncovered after a fire broke out in the factory.
"The drugs found included Eramin pills and syabu worth an estimated RM18mil," he said, adding that a special taskforce, headed by state deputy police chief Senior Asst Comm Datuk Ismail Yatim, had been formed to investigate the matter.
Fire and Rescue Department officers stumbled upon the lab on the second floor of the factory after a fire broke out at around 1.30pm on June 11.
They also found drug-making machines and chemicals.
