Two Taoists filed police reports over the use of a Taoist priest's sacred robe in a fashion show.
The two men - a businessman and a Taoist priest - said they were offended when they saw the photo of the robe being used at the fashion show organised by the Floral Designers Society Singapore (FDSS) last month, reported The Straits Times.
Netizens who saw the photo uploaded onto the society's Facebook page had reported the photo to the Taoist Federation.
Federation chief Tan Thiam Lye had earlier told devotees to refrain from making police reports until after his meeting with the FDSS.
Leaders of the FDSS apologised to the Taoist community after the meeting with Mr Tan on Wednesday.
FDSS president Christopher Lim told The Straits Times they were not aware of the religious significance of the robe. He added that the society would be more cautious about the use of costumes during future events.
The designer behind the outfit, who is also a Taoist priest, could not be reached for comment.
