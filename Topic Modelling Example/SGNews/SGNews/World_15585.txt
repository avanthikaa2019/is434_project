TBILISI, Georgia - A memorial museum of Georgia's most infamous son Joseph Stalin in his hometown Gori will be transformed into museum of Stalinism to focus on Soviet-era repression, the government said on Monday.
The existing Stalin museum in the Georgian town of Gori "is simply incompatible with our present day and with our future," Culture Minister Nicoloz Rurua said in televised remarks.
"History cannot be erased and this very difficult page in our country's history must be adequately displayed within these walls," he said during a visit to the museum.
The museum in Gori was opened in 1937 in a small brick hut where the Soviet dictator was born.
In 1957, a grand granite and marble structure was constructed nearby to house an exhibition aimed at chronicling and glorifying Stalin's life.
In 2010, keen to erase Soviet legacy, Georgia's fervently pro-Western government removed a huge bronze statue of Stalin which had stood in Gori's main square since 1952.
A law was adopted last year banning the public display of Soviet symbols and prohibiting former Communist and KGB officials from holding public office.
An annual "Soviet Occupation Day" was also launched - a commemoration of the Red Army invasion in 1921 which forced independent Georgia into the USSR.
Born Joseph Dzhugashvili in Gori in 1878, Stalin ruled the Soviet Union with an iron fist from the late 1920s until his death in 1953.
He is accused by historians of causing the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens in brutal Gulag prison camps and through the forced collectivisation of agriculture.
However there are still relatively few memorials in the former Soviet Union and particularly Russia to the victims of the horrific repression carried out by the Stalin regime.
