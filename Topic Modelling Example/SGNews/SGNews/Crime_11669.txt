SINGAPORE - A flight steward with Qatar Airways was jailed on Tuesday for bribing a cop over an incident of outrage of modesty.
Rinosh Joseph Noble, 33, had molested an undercover policeman in the toilet of The Verge shopping centre on March 21.
He offered $100 to the cop and two other officers, who were on an anti-crime operation at the mall, to keep quiet about the incident.
The court sentenced him to one month in jail and a fine of $10,000 for bribery, said The Straits Times.
He also received a stern warning for molesting the officer.
His lawyer, Mr Subhas Anandan, said his client was an exceptionally talented individual, who graduated with a first class honours degree in engineering in India. He was also very good singer and had qualified for vocal training at the London School of Music.
Noble's wife from Indian was present at the hearing. The couple has no children.
