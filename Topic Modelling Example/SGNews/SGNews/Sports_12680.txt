SINGAPORE - The SAFRA Singapore Bay Run and the Army Half Marathon will be held on Sept 9 this year in celebration of 45 years of national service and SAFRA's 40th anniversary, the organising committee said on Thursday.
Registration will be opened to the public by June 1.
Jointly organised by SAFRA and the Singapore Army, the annual mass-running event is the largest in Singapore.
The event comprises both the competitive 21-km half-marathon and 10-km routes. Social runners can participate in the non-competitive 5 km Fun Run as well.
Participants will get to enjoy a unique route taking them over the new downtown around the Marina Bay area as well historical places.
There will also be street side performances to entertain the runners along the various running routes. Stage performances at the end-point will welcome the runners as they cross the finishing line.
The event aims to promote a healthy lifestyle and reinforces SAFRA and the SAF's emphasis on physical fitness.
Over the years, participation has grown from 15,000 when it first started in 1992 to about 70,000 last year.
