The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) confirmed yesterday that 73 Taiwanese were among the more than 150 suspects arrested by Malaysian police on Thursday for their involvement in tele-scams and online gambling operations targeting mostly Chinese and overseas Chinese living in other Asian nations. MOFA officials said Selangor police in Malaysia placed 74 suspects from China and five native Malaysian in custody after raids.
Officials from the Criminal Investigation Bureau and other government agencies are expected to help Malaysian police with the investigation in accordance with the international cooperation on fighting crimes.
The Taiwanese and Chinese first masterminded the schemes and then recruiting people from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland as well as local Malaysian.
The suspects' operations included using telephone calls to cheat victims by faking kidnappings of their relatives, claiming the victims had criminal records, and offering to settle or remove their black records for a sum of cash.
They also set up Internet gambling and carried out online scams with illegal betting on sports events, including English football games.
The police also confiscated 43 computers and 241 telephone that were used to contact and cheat their victims.
Police officers in Taiwan have contacted their Malaysian counterparts for cooperation on joint problems.
This is not the first crime ring comprised of Chinese and Taiwanese operating in a third Asian nations to victimize other Chinese or Taiwanese.
Many operators who used to set up their operating stations in Taiwan have moved to neighboring Southeast Asian nations after the government, the CIB, and local police departments stepped up campaigns to crack down on the syndicates and remind people to stay alert to similar scans.
Since sports betting is illegal in Malaysia and those found guilty can be jailed. Malaysia police said they would push for up to 20 years in prison if the suspect are found guilty.
