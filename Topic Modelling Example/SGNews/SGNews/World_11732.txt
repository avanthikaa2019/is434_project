WASHINGTON - Vice President Joe Biden is in Delaware this week to get ready for his daughter Ashley's wedding, with the reception to take place at his home, the White House said on Tuesday.
"As any father would, he takes this matter very seriously and looks forward to it with great happiness for his daughter and his future son-in-law," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing dominated by tensions in Syria.
"And I have no details on the dress," he said.
Ashley, 30, is Biden's only child with his current wife Jill.
