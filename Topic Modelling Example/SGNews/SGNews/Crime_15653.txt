MALAYSIA - A 37-year-old Singaporean was among four women arrested at a shopping mall in Klang, Selangor, yesterday for allegedly selling babies.
The woman is believed to be the middleman for the syndicate.
South Klang OCPD Asst Comm Mohamad Mat Yusop told The Star that police surveillance had led them to a cafe at the mall, where the Singaporean was spotted with three other Malaysian suspects.
New Straits Times reported that the women were between 28 and 51 years old.
Said ACP Mohamad: "Many photos of babies were found on the Singaporean's mobile phone, more than 10. And there were messages indicating transactions took place."
Two male babies, 22-day-old Lee Kelvin and an unidentified three-month-old, were also rescued.
Lee Kelvin was found with his birth certificate and passport. He is of Chinese-Indian parentage and his passport had been issued only two weeks ago, on March 19.
"We have so far managed to track down the parents of Lee and called them in to record their statement," ACP Mohamad said.
The other baby had no papers.
ACP Mohamad said that the babies were likely to have been sold by their parents to the middleman and not abducted, and that the Malaysians were believed to be the nannies of the babies.
The babies were taken to hospital for a DNA test and medical check-up, and were then handed over to the Welfare Department.
The case is being investigated under Section 14 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act.
