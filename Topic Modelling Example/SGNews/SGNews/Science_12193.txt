mio TV customers who were enraged by SingTel's coverage of the EPL finals on May 13 will be compensated with a month's subscription.
SingTel will credit $34.90 - the equivalent of a month's subscription of mio TV's Sports Pack into subscribers' bills for the month of June.
SingTel's Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Singapore, Mr Yuen Kuan Moon apologised in an online posting, promising that the telco would take steps to ensure that a similar situation would not occur again.
In the apology posted on SingTel's website, Mr Yuen said: "We are deeply sorry for the poor viewing experience. As sports fans ourselves, we fully understand your excitement and the anticipation for these matches. We regret letting you down on this important occasion."
On May 13, Singapore football fans were left fuming after a glitch in Singtel mio TV's live coverage of the final round of English Premier League football matches caused repeated incidences of 'freezing' screens.
The glitch was particularly ill-timed because fans were watching Manchester City and Manchester United fighting in their respective games for the EPL title.
The service disruption also prompted the Media Development Authority (MDA) to launch a probe.
