Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa announced that the autopsy surgeries currently performed on three Indonesian migrant workers' bodies found no signs of missing internal organs. The results apparently downplayed speculation of organ trafficking.
"The police forensics team finds no evidence that would support [speculation on] organ trafficking," Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said during a press conference held on Friday.
He said, however, that the government would still urge its Malaysian counterparts to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the workers' deaths. He said it was also important to know whether there were any violations committed by the Malaysian Police.
National Police Health Division Chief Brig. Gen. Musaddeq Ishaq said that all of body's vital organs, including brains, eyes, liver, and kidneys were intact.
"Stitches that were found on the bodies were caused by previous autopsies in Malaysia," he said.
The recent autopsies, which were conducted from Thursday to Friday in Indonesia, were led by the police's health division and Mataram Medical University.
The three migrant workers who were reportedly from West Nusa Tenggara, namely Herman, Abdul Kadir Jaelani and Mad Noon, were shot dead in Port Dickson, Malaysia, and allegedly had their organs harvested soon after.
The three went to Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, in 2010 to work on a plantation.
