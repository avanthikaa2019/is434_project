Some 50 office workers and students found a quirky way to relieve stress in the heart of the Central Business District yesterday - by flipping tables.
The table-pitching frenzy on the grass patch in front of Chevron House attracted hundreds of curious onlookers, who gaped at the unusual sight at lunchtime.
While some participants let out cries of angst in their attempts to send the table flying, others did it with broad grins. One young man even threw what appeared to be exam notes on the table, before overturning it with all the strength he could muster.
Designer Lennard Tsen, 25, said that he found the activity "very fun", although he was disappointed when he did not damage the table.
Buzz for the event, Mission: Flip Table, was created through a poster on social network Facebook, which was shared more than 1,000 times in three days.
However, it was taken down shortly after it went viral as the organisers, Mission: Singapore, were worried that they would be unable to cope with the crowd that would turn up.
"Publicity was going fast and furious and we got concerned," explained 24-year-old undergraduate Darryl Seah, who is one of the organisers in the home-grown flash-mob group.
Despite the organisers' attempts to keep things down, netizens continued to circulate the poster over the week. As of yesterday, about 100 people had confirmed their attendance on the event's Facebook page. In the end, 51 participated.
The organisers bought six tables for the event, using money from their own pockets. All the tables were damaged an hour after the table flipping began.
Mr Seah told my paper that Mission: Flip Table aimed to cheer Singaporeans up and help them relieve stress.
He added: "Singaporeans need to smile more, no matter what they do."
