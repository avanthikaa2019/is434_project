When we walked into the school campus on the day of the sports heats, we were greeted by a flood of colour; red, blue, yellow and green proudly representing our houses: Pioneers, Voyagers, Discoverers and Explorers respectively. We were all very excited and ready for an active and exhausting day ahead.
After getting together with our housemates, we warmed up on the sunny grounds before heading towards the various activities like relay, long jump, high jump and shot put. We really enjoyed participating in them and also had fun cheering our housemates during the final selection. The teachers were out in the sun with us the whole day, recording each performance.
At the end of the day, we were all very tired, but contented.
