SINGAPORE - Tickets to this year's National Day Parade (NDP) Preview have been found on eBay, reported a local news source.
They're going for as much as S$100.
One of the listings on the website throws in a pair of free tickets when you purchase a watch, the report said.
It is an offence to sell NDP tickets.
According to the report, anyone found selling tickets will be barred from balloting for tickets for three years.
