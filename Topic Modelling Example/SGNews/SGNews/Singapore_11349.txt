KOTA KINABALU - A bus driver's calculated risk probably saved the lives of 34 Singaporeans on a tour bus that could have plunged into a 50m ravine along the Crocker Range.
The driver's decision to brake at a downhill stretch helped stop the bus that was tailing behind.
The driver of the second bus had apparently lost control of the vehicle shortly after negotiating a sharp bend on the mountainous road.
The impact caused the second bus to overturn barely 20m from the ravine where four Prisons Department officers had been killed after the bus they were travelling in plunged on Dec 17, 2010.
Six passengers were injured in yesterday's 3.50pm mishap at KM24.5 of the Kota Kinabalu-Tambunan trunk road.
Penampang OCPD Deputy Supt Ratan Kumar Singh said initial investigations indicated the driver of the first bus had braked to stop the second bus, after noticing that the other vehicle appeared out of control.
He said all 24 passengers were unhurt though shaken by the impact.
All the injured were rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.
Passenger Koh Lye Siang, 62, said the two buses had left Tambunan at 3pm after a two-day church retreat.
"Everything was fine until we reached the sharp bend and our bus started shaking and we were flung about as it overturned," said Koh, who attended the retreat with her daughter Dorothy.
