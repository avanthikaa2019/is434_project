BAGHDAD - Bombs targeting Shi'ite pilgrims in Baghdad and police in southern Iraq killed at least 44 people on Wednesday in a wave of attacks during a major religious festival, police and hospital sources said.
At least 18 people were killed when four bombs hit Shi'ite pilgrims across Baghdad as they gathered to mark the anniversary of the death of Shi'ite imam Moussa al-Kadhim, a great-grandson of Prophet Mohammad.
In the southern city of Hilla, two bombs, including one detonated by a suicide car bomber, exploded outside restaurants frequented by police, killing 22 people and wounding 38. Two more car bombs killed four people in the mainly Shi'ite city of Balad.
