Shariffah Faaiqah, 11, has been deaf since birth. She has never heard music.
But come National Day, Shariffah and eight of her schoolmates at the Singapore School for the Deaf will appear in a music video.
As part of the "LovingSG: One Heart, One Voice" campaign, the nine deaf pupils were filmed yesterday "singing" the national anthem, Majulah Singapura, using sign language.
Their video, along with videos of numerous other Singaporeans singing the anthem, will be spliced together and will premiere during the National Day Parade (NDP) at The Float @ Marina Bay.
"We hope to show that deaf kids are equal to the kids who can hear. They can participate in the NDP too," Mr Dennis Tan, a teacher at the School for the Deaf, told my paper.
Mr Tan, who is also deaf, spoke to my paper through a sign-language interpreter.
The final video will be put together by music conductor Darrell Ang and film-maker Royston Tan.
"Musical expressions are a very powerful way to unite everyone," said Lieutenant-Colonel Ng Sin Ain, chairman of the Branding and Publicity Engagement Committee. "We will try our best...to include everyone (who submits a video), so that nobody will be left out," he added.
