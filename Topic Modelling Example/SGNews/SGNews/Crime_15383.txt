MUAR, Malaysia - Five robbers armed with machetes broke into the house of an elderly couple and escaped with cash, jewellery and a car totalling about RM60,000 (S$24,690).
The robbers first cut the grille of a window behind the house and then held up the couple's son, 46, before entering their room.
Hawa Ahmad, 73, was sleeping with her husband Mohd Yassin Nor, 75, when she heard her son shouting at about 2am yesterday.
"At first, I thought my son was having a bad dream and asked my husband to check on him. However, when we opened the bedroom door, we saw him being held by the robbers," she said yesterday.
Hawa added that the robbers used sarong from the house to mask their faces.
"I begged the robbers not to hurt me and my family. I also told them that I had a heart problem.
"But the robbers tied us up anyway, before locking us in a room and ransacking our home," Hawa said, adding that the robbers managed to find her savings of about RM10,000 and some jewellery.
"They also took a laptop, two handphones and our Perodua Viva car."
They lodged a report at the Lenga police station at about 3.30am yesterday.
