KUALA LUMPUR - Former badminton ace Jalani Sidek and Raja Azmi Raja Sulaiman have divorced, following months of speculations over their differences.
They parted with tears, kissing each other's cheeks and Raja Azmi kissing his hand after their 28-year marriage ended at the Gombak Timur Lower Syariah Court here yesterday.
Both said they would continue to be friends.
Jalani and his brother Razif had a sterling badminton career through the 80s and much of the 90s, becoming the first-ever Olympic medalists for the country when they won the bronze in 1992.
Raja Azmi, a book publisher and filmmaker, was recently seen as a participant in Astro's Celebrity MasterChef reality show.
Jalani, now a badminton coach, divorced her with talak satu (first pronouncement of divorce) before Syariah judge Saiful Azli Jamaludin.
The judge commended the action of the couple to remain as friends.
Raja Azmi, 53, represented by Syariah lawyer Roslizam Rahim, filed an application for divorce under Section 47 of the Islamic Family Law (Selangor) 2003.
Earlier, Roslizam told the court the couple had discussed the matter for a long time.
He also submitted that his client and the defendant, whose real name is Mohamed Jalani Mohamed Sidek, 48, had faced various speculation that caused a strain in their relationship.
"It took them quite a while to agree that it would be better for them to just be friends, rather than husband and wife," he said.
Also in court yesterday was the couple's second child, Puteri Suaida, 23.
They have another daughter, Puteri Suraya, 27, and a son, Megat Deli, 18, as well as a year-old grandchild.
Met outside the court, Raja Azmi, in a black baju kurung, denied that a third party had led to their breakup.
She said Jalani, known fondly as Alan among his friends, had been a good husband.
Jalani said he would move on and try to forget the past.
He said he agreed to the divorce because he wanted to be fair to Raja Azmi and for the sake of her happiness.
