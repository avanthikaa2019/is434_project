KUALA LUMPUR - Legendary Indonesian jazz singer Harvey Malaihollo, who has a string of hits in his 20-year career, is set to present his chartbusters and other classic favourites when he performs here on July 3.
The crooner, whose hits include Jerat, Diunjung Rindu, Katakan Saja and Dara, is hugely popular in his home country as well as in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.
His one-night live show "With Love ... Harvey" will be staged at the KL Performing Arts Centre (KLPAC).
Harvey is slated to sing his trademark jazz ballads as well as a mixed genre of soft jazz and contemporary hits, which will take his audience on a musical trip dating from the 80s.
His father was a sailor while his mum was part of a singing trio.
Aside from the support of his parents, Harvey, who was born in Ambon in 1962, is said to be immensely influenced by the music of Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson in his musical pursuit.
He has won numerous awards in Indonesia and Malaysia as well as international musical accolades.
The Indonesian superstar has also done duets with other singers such as Kris Dayanti and Ruth Sahanaya, as well as international stars like Julio Iglesias and Malaysia's own Sheila Majid.
