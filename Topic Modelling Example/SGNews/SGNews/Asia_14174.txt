At a workshop in Government House yesterday, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra advised all agencies to come up with a system to prevent corruption in their ranks.
"Agencies should set up a system and assign officers to examine such practices. This could take the form of a 'war room' monitoring corruption under the Justice Ministry's Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission," she said.
The premier explained that graft eradication was one of the government's urgent policies and that all those in charge should closely follow up on anti-corruption measures.
She also asked the meeting to what extent anti-corruption attempts had been implemented, and how many people had lodged complaints about graft so far. She said the process must be transparent and open to examination. Legal amendments could be proposed if necessary.
