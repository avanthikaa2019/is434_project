Coming off two disappointing draws which dented their Malaysian Super League title hopes, the Singapore LionsXII team took out their frustrations on Sarawak with a 3-0 win at Jalan Besar Stadium last night.
The result allowed the Lions to open up a seven-point gap atop the league table, with 44 points from 22 matches.
However, second-placed defending champions Kelantan are the ones in the driver's seat, with a whopping six matches in hand.
After two consecutive draws against Kedah and Kuala Lumpur before last night's match, LionsXII coach V. Sundramoorthy had wanted his players to concentrate on finishing the season in second spot, ahead of teams like third- placed Negeri Sembilan.
And the Lions responded by putting in a dominant performance against eighth-placed Sarawak that put a 15-point gap between themselves and Negeri, who have played four fewer matches.
They showed their intent as early as the seventh minute, when they took the lead, courtesy of some abysmal defending from Sarawak from a corner, as defender Safuwan Baharudin rose unchallenged to head home from close range.
Hardly allowing Sarawak's strikers to even have a sniff at goal, the Lions doubled their lead after a brilliant interplay from their strike force of Agu Casmir and Sufian Anuar in the 36 minute.
Casmir's deft flick sent Sufian through on goal and, while Sarawak's Saiful Amar blocked Sufian's shot, Casmir was alert enough to slot the rebound home.
Casmir notched his second goal when sent through by Shahdan Sulaiman in the 64th minute. His first shot was blocked by Saiful, but he again made no mistake with the rebound.
