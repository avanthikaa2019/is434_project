SINGAPORE - A 25-year-old man was found with multiple open wounds after a fight at Blk 1005 Bukit Merah Lane 2 on May 28 at about 6.05pm.
According to the police, the unidentified man was later sent to Alexandra Hospital, where he subsequently succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at about 7.20pm.
On the same day, a 39-year-old man surrendered himself to the police and was placed under arrest.
According to eye-witnesses, the man was stabbed in front of a busy street yesterday afternoon, in front of a row of motor workshops at Bukit Merah Industrial Estate.
The New Paper reported that the assailant is believed to be an employee of one of the workshops in the area.
Madam Lynn, 32, was visiting a motor workshop in the vicinity with her husband when she noticed the man walking pass, before suddenly collapsing on the pavement near the gate of the Singapore Contractors Association.
She described the victim as having blonde hair and tattoos on his body. He was wearing a tight fitting black T-shirt and jeans.
When the man remained motionless on the pavement, she and a few others went to check on him, and was shocked to discover that he was bleeding profusely from multiple wounds.
She said she did not hear any shouting or arguments before the incident.
However, her husband, a 39-year-old clerk, said he had been approached by a "skinny" man in his 30s before the incident at about 5pm asking him if he was a friend of a man called "Man".
Madam Lynn's husband said that even after telling the man "no", he came back five minutes later to ask him again.
The unidentified man, who was dressed in a blue and white shirt and cargo pants, then said: "If you are Man's friend, ask him not to look for trouble or he better watch out."
The husband said he recognised the man as an employee of one of the workshops there.
The 39-year-old man under police custody will be charged in court on May 30 at 9am for an offence of murder.
