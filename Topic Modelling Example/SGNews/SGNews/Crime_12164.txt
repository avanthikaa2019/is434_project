KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - A rich widow was conned into giving RM5mil (S$2 million) to a "General" supposedly serving with the US army whom she had met online.
The 63-year-old auditor started chatting with the man on the Internet in October 2010.
He claimed to be a high-ranking officer in the US army and used the picture of a good-looking Caucasian man to fool her.
The woman sold her house in Bangsar for RM3.5mil and borrowed money to give to the man for his business investment.
Suspecting something amiss, the woman's 30-year-old son lodged a police report in September last year and police have been monitoring her activities ever since.
City Commercial Crime Department chief Assistant Commissioner Mohd Izany Abdul Ghany said police busted the syndicate with the arrest of a 50-year-old local woman on Monday.
He said she was nabbed in her house in Subang Jaya at 2.30pm, a few hours after the victim transferred RM50,000 into her account.
Following the arrest, police raided two houses in Kuala Lumpur and Kota Damansara on Monday and Tuesday where they nabbed 15 Nigerian men.
"The syndicate has been active for more than two years and we believe more victims have been conned by its members," he said yesterday.
ACP Izany also said initial investigation revealed all the Nigerian suspects hold student visas and study at local colleges.
The local woman is believed to be one of the Nigerians' girlfriend.
"She has several accounts under her name, including a legally-registered company account," he added.
The female suspect is being been remanded until today while the Nigerians' remand order will end tomorrow.
