The daily also reported about a newly married man who raped his underage adopted sister in Puchong.
The 25-year-old man, who married two months ago, was said to have raped the girl last August but the incident only came to light after the girl, who is now eight months' pregnant, could no longer hide her pregnancy.
Subang Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Yahaya Ramli said the man frequently stayed over at the victim's house where the rape had allegedly taken place.
The victim's family reported the incident and police are now trying to trace the man who has since disappeared.
