LONDON - Iranian-born Shahriar Firouzian told a London court on Tuesday that he thought he had run over a fox the night he hit and dragged Singaporean student, Tan Mingwei on Sep 30, 2010.
The driver is facing charges of causing Tan's death by careless driving, reported The Straits Times. He has been working with bus firm Metroline since 2003.
She was hit while crossing from Fleet Street to Pond Street in Hampstead, north-west London and dragged 852 metres to Haverstock Hill, prosecutors told jurors yesterday.
The Daily Mail reported that prosecutor Hamish Reid, told the jurors, "He should have anticipated that pedestrians might be present in the road in front of him.
"Essentially by failing to ensure that he had a clear view in front of him, he fell below the standard to be expected by a competent and careful driver and was driving without due care and attention.
"It is by this failure on his part that he collided with Ms Tan and this caused her death."
The driver had then continued with his route and finished his shift. He only discovered the accident the next day when he reported for work.
Footage from the closed circuit television (CCTV) on the bus that Tan had taken to Hampstead and the bus that was driven by Firouzian was also shown in court on Tuesday.
Jurors were also taken to the accident scene to give them an idea of the positions of the street CCTVs and the view that Firouzian would have had when turning into Pond Street.
Passers-by who discovered her body called for help, but she was declared dead on the scene.
The Daily Mail also reported that she had returned from a holiday on Sep 29 and was in Hampstead to pick up some luggage from family friends.
The Straits Times also reported that the company Metroline, which Firouzian was working for is a subsidiary of ComfortDelGro.
