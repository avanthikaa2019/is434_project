PETALING JAYA - Better be paranoid than sorry - that seems to be the motto of many women drivers following reports of crimes at car parks.
Writer Josephine Lau, 29, said that it is important for women to be aware of their surroundings.
"While some say that you can't do much if you are already marked, I really believe that there is something everyone can do to prevent themselves from becoming victims," Lau added.
She said the self-defence class she had just attended "drilled" into her the need to be "paranoid" at all times.
"Some of the tips are simple things we take for granted - like not talking on your phone when you cross the street," she said.
Lau said she always checks her car mirrors when she drives, avoids going out too late at night and steers clear of dimly-lit parking lots.
Her concerned boyfriend had also recently bought her a bamb&shy;oo stick to put in her car and a can of mace to carry around.
Cecilia Ong, in her late 40s, said she felt that car parks in shopping malls were not safe because there was no way of telling who's lurking around.
"I avoid going out unnecessarily these days," said Ong, adding that she parks at open car parks whenever possible.
"I think women should try to only go to places where they are confident of the security of the car park," said Ong.
MCA Public Services and Comp&shy;laints Department head Datuk Seri Michael Chong said he received a lot of complaints about theft after women leave their cars to go for sporting activities.
"Women should be careful because most of the culprits tend to observe women as they are easy targets," said Chong.
He criticised car park operators who did not install CCTVs.
"They need to ask themselves why these people only choose certain places to commit crime?
He also slammed car park operators who took security lightly.
"Why do they only comply with the (minimum) permissible level of lighting when they could increase lighting in the area and employ guards?" Chong said.
