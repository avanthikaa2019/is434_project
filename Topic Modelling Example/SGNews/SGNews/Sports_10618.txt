LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II's granddaughter Zara Phillips said she had been picked for Great Britain's equestrian eventing team at the London Olympics.
The 31-year-old Phillips, whose parents Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips also competed for Britain in the Olympics, will ride the horse High Kingdom at the Games which open on July 27.
&ldquo;It's awesome to be given this opportunity,&rdquo; said Phillips.
&ldquo;I am really excited and can't wait to kick on and get him there.
Hopefully, we will make it this time.&rdquo;
There was no immediate confirmation from the British Olympic Association.
Phillips, who is married to former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, had her hopes of an Olympic place in 2004 and 2008 dashed by injuries to her world title-winning horse Toytown.
&ldquo;High Kingdom is a pretty cool, very relaxed kind of guy. I was really happy with him at Bramham as he had obviously grown up and is improving all the time,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;He's pretty pony-like, a nippy little jumper and easy to manoeuvre, so hopefully it will suit him well in Greenwich.&rdquo;
The equestrian events are taking place in Greenwich Park in southeast London.
&ldquo;High Kingdom is owned by Trevor Hemmings, who has been one of my earliest supporters. He has owned a lot of my horses and has been so supportive, I couldn't do it without him.&rdquo;
Phillips won her spot after clinching third place in the Bramham International CIC three-star class on Sunday with a personal best dressage score, and then jumping clear in the showjumping and cross-country phases. Phillips been chosen alongside William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Piggy French and Tina Cook for London 2012.
Princess Anne competed at the 1976 Montreal Games while Mark Phillips was a team gold medallist at Munich in 1972 and then won silver in Seoul 16 years later.
