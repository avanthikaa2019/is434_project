SINGAPORE - Rental prices of hawker stalls have dropped in the recent March and April tenders following a policy change in the recent Budget Debate in March.
More than one-third of the bids for 50 hawker stalls were below their previous reserve prices, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Tuesday.
The lower prices are possible due to the removal of the reserve rent, which is the minimum rent the Government imposes when it rents out stalls through tenders.
Under the revised scheme, vacant stalls would be allocated to the highest bidder.
This means that it didn't matter if the bid was low, as long as there is more than one bid and the bid is competitive.
The market then sets its clearing price for stalls and reduces the cost pressure on stallholders.
In a statement on Tuesday, Senior Minister of State Ms Grace Fu said: "The revised policy of allocating vacant stalls to the highest bidder...should help ease stall rentals and thereby moderate costs for hawkers, which benefits our objective of maintaining food price affordability for the community.
"I am happy to observe that successful bids from the March and April tender exercises have trended downwards as compared to previous months, with many of them below the previous reserve rents.
"I hope that our available stall spaces can be better utilised as more becomes aware of the revised policies. This would also help increase the variety of eating and marketing options available to the community."
