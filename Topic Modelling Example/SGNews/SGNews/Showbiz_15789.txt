Known for her beauty as well as her brains, actress Sara Ali who starred in local comedy Jangan Pandang-pandang (Don't Look) wants to further her education in filming at the New York Film Academy (NYFA) to fulfill her life-long dream of becoming a film director.
Acting, she told mStar in an interview, is only a means to achieving the end goal.
"What I am doing now (acting), is only part of the learning process. Ultimately, I would like to be a film director.
"I have also been spending a lot of time learning the ropes behind the scenes. God willing, I would be able to further my studies in the film industry overseas.
"For now, NYFA is my first choice," said Sara, who already holds an undergraduate degree in architecture from the Lim Kok Wing University.
The 22-year-old said she hoped to move from acting to film-making by the time she turns 30.
When asked why she preferred to stay away from the public eye, Sara said it was to preserve her "exclusive value".
Sara, who cited actress Maya Karin as her idol, said she wanted to be appreciated for her work, and not for anything else.
"It puzzles me sometimes, the way society favours someone merely for the way they look or just for their talent.
"This is why I prefer to stay low-key, so that people will be able to appreciate me solely for my work as an actress," said the lass who hails from Batu Pahat, Johor.
Sara said she was excited to receive feedback on her role in Jangan Pandang-pandang, in which she co-starred with Zizan Razak, Nas-T and Miera Leyana.
"I hope my acting will win the hearts of the viewers. Since the movie was a comedy, I was able to bring out my funny side," she said.
Other local films starring Sara Ali include Sesuatu Yang Tertinggal, Songlap, Penunggu Istana, Nur Kasih: The Movie and Azazil.
