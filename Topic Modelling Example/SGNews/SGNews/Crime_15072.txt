One blind man surnamed Guan was found to have committed nearly 20 crimes of stealing since 2010 in Chun'an county, East China's Zhejiang province after being discovered as liable by the police, according to the local website zjol.com.cn.
He lost his eyesight at the age of 6 because of high fevers and urticaria. For the next 30 years, he supported himself as a maintenance worker and with the help of his mother and sister, although his financial situation was never well-off.
He is able to steal because of his excellent aural ability. He is able to detect the places where his neighbors would store their money. Given his predicament, Guan's neighbors never saw him as a potential thief when they were putting away their money in his presence. He has stolen more than 10,000 yuan ($1500) in the past two years, according to the report.
