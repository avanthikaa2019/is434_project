HONG KONG - Former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham flew into controversy on Monday after she posed for a picture in a crew-only seat on a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong.
"Cabin crew prepare for landing! Welcome to Beijing!! X vb," she wrote on Twitter alongside a photograph of her sitting in the crew seats aboard the Beijing-bound flight on Friday. Click here to find out more!
Wearing sunglasses and a peach-coloured dress, she appears to be making an announcement on the public address system while a stewardess sitting next to her pulls a funny face.
An airline spokeswoman said the stunt was harmless but "inappropriate". The photo was not taken at any critical stage of the flight, such as take-off or landing, she added.
"The passenger only posed for the picture. No public announcement was made," the spokeswoman told AFP.
"It was inappropriate as ... the crew seats are only for the cabin crew and passengers should not be allowed to touch any of the aircraft equipment."
The Hong Kong Standard newspaper reported that Beckham, wife of English football star David Beckham, had been criticised on Internet forums for putting the flight's safety at risk.
The former Posh Spice was heading to Beijing to launch a new car at a motor show this weekend.
