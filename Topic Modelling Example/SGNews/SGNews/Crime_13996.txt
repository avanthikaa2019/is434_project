SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia - A contractor, who inherited his father's business a few months ago, was found dead with a gun shot wound to the head at a carpark off Jalan Central 2, USJ1, here.
Loh Kon Chong, 34, was found early yesterday by three friends who wanted to park their car there.
They had initially thought that it was a man who had plummeted to death but were shocked to discover that it was their friend instead.
Forensic investigations revealed that the three empty bullet shells found at the scene were discharged from a 22mm-calibre pistol.
Subang Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Yahaya Ramli said Loh hailed from Kota Kinabalu, adding that police ruled out robbery as a motive as his belongings were intact.
"We found a car registered under the victim's business about five metres from the body. However, we have not found the murder weapon. We are still investigating the motive of the incident," he said.
His remains have been taken to the Serdang Hospital for post-mortem.
