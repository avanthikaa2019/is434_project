US actor David Arquette finally got his coming-of-age ceremony - almost three decades late.
The 40-year-old, whose mum is Jewish, went through a bar mitzvah on Monday at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Israel, a rite typically reserved for Jewish boys when they turn 13.
Arquette was in the holy city to film an episode for his Travel Channel show, Mile High, and was open to the idea of undergoing a bar mitzvah after witnessing one first-hand.
Rabbi of the Western Wall Shmuel Rabinowitz, who conducted the ceremony for Arquette, said Arquette was very emotional and happy to be "part of the chain of the Jewish people".
Arquette was no less pleased, tweeting: "I had my Bar Mitzvah today at the wall. Finally I'm a man."
