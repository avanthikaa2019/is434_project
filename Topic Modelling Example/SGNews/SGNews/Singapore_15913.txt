SINGAPORE - It's important that the people of Singapore understand the Indian heritage as they are close to India and many people with an Indian background live here... that's the reason IT company Si2I Mobility's founder B.K. Modi gave when asked about his generous donation to the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC).
The $1 million donation, made on April 3, will fund the construction costs of the IHC's new building located at the junction of Campbell Lane and Clive Street.
Work is expected to begin next year and it will be operationally ready in 2014.
Speaking to reporters at the donation ceremony, which was attended by former president S.R. Nathan, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade and Industry S. Iswaran and Tamil Murasu chairman S. Chandra Das, Dr Modi said the people of Singapore, especially the youths, should know what India is all about and embracing new technology in the IHC would serve this purpose well.
His companies have supported Indian heritage work in cities like London, New York and Los Angeles.
