The government on Wednesday set up an emergency office in the Crisis Management Center at the Prime Minister's Office in preparation for North Korea's planned missile launch, which may take place as early as Thursday morning.
The office is headed by Toshiro Yonemura, deputy chief cabinet secretary for crisis management.
Cabinet ministers were instructed to go on alert at their respective ministries from 7 a.m. Thursday and to remain on alert.
If and when the missile is launched, the government will swiftly convene a meeting of the Security Council of Japan to discuss responses, government officials said.
"We are taking such steps as a precaution for an emergency situation. I would ask the general public to stay calm," Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told a news conference Wednesday morning.
The Foreign Ministry also set up an emergency headquarters for the missile launch in the afternoon to gather information around the clock.
