Former principal, Lee Lip Hong, said he is ashamed of his own actions and broke down several times during his hour-long court proceedings.
The 39-year-old, who is charged with having paid $500 for the underage prostitute's sexual services at Hotel 81 Bencoolen on Sept 26, 2010, requested to make a statement to the judge.
He said: "Your Honour, I would like to confess that I am fully ashamed of my own actions and more importantly the pain and harm that I have caused to my family members, especially my wife.
"My wife has magnanimously taken a tough decision to forgive me, and even proposed to reaffirm our wedding vows once again.
"It is my personal lack of control of my own moral standards and my weak resistance to distractors that have led me to my mistake."
The former principal of Pei Chun Public School had pleaded guilty and has been sentenced to nine weeks imprisonment on Friday.
Speaking to reporters after Mr Lee was sentenced, his lawyer Melanie Ho said her client will not appeal the sentence.
"Our client accepts his punishment and, as you have seen from the start, he has been ready to face the consequences of his mistake. He looks forward to moving on and putting all of this behind him. And he would like to thank everybody that's supported him and he also wishes for forgiveness.
"Of course, it has been a trying time as can be expected with the media glare but he's ready to move on."
According to Ms Ho, a partner at Wong Partnership, Mr Lee was not accompanied by his wife as he had deliberately told her to avoid the media frenzy surrounding his case.
