A general practitioner (GP) has been suspended for four months on 10 charges of professional misconduct.
A Disciplinary Committee Inquiry was held for Dr Kwan Wai Chee, 43, on March 12, following a complaint in December 2008 by the Ministry of Health to the Singapore Medical Council.
At the time of complaint, Dr Kwan was practising at the Bishan Grace Clinic at Block 150, Bishan Street 11.
Charges against Dr Kwan included the inappropriate prescription of hypnotics and/or code-ine containing cough mixtures to patients, failure to refer the patient to a medical specialist for further or joint management, and the concomitant prescriptions of two hypnotics to some patients.
Relevant factors considered by the Committee included inadequate notes in the patient medical records, which did not appear to contain any plan for the management of these patients.
A first-time offender, Dr Kwan pleaded guilty to 10charges, with 10 more similar charges taken into consideration.
In addition to the suspension, which took effect on April 12, she was fined $5,000 and was ordered to pay the costs and expenses of the inquiry proceedings.
