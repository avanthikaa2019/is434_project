PHNOM PENH - A French architect with ties to disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has been arrested in Cambodia, the French Embassy said yesterday, in a new twist to China's biggest political scandal in decades.
Cambodian police said the arrest of Mr Patrick Devillers was carried out with the cooperation of Beijing, which is seeking his extradition.
"We've been informed by the Cambodian authorities of the arrest of our compatriot, Mr Devillers," a French Embassy spokesman said.
Officials were seeking "clarification" on the reason for the arrest, she said.
Mr Devillers is understood to have been a close business associate and friend of Mr Bo and his wife, Gu Kailai.
Phnom Penh police chief Touch Naruth confirmed that a French national was arrested "about two weeks ago" but declined to give details, saying only that the arrest was made "with the cooperation of China".
"We are considering whether to send him to China or France. China has demanded he be sent to China because he committed offences there," he said.
Mr Devillers' connection to the Bo family drama remains unclear.
