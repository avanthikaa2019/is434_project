PETALING JAYA - Errant traders hoping to cash in on fake Euro 2012 memorabilia should think twice as enforcement officers will be on the lookout for people selling such merchandise throughout the football tournament.
The Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism Ministry warned errant traders to stop selling fake Euro 2012 merchandise after raiding a house and recovering items worth RM400,000 (S$162,000).
The ministry's enforcement division raided the house in Taman Miharja, Cheras in Kuala Lumpur yesterday and seized clothes, including fake Euro 2012 national team jerseys.
"Traders should respect intellectual property rights. We will be monitoring them and we will take stern action against those who flout the law," said the Ministry's enforcement division director-general Mohd Roslan Mahayuddin.
Spain, Holland, Croatia and Portugal jerseys were among the 6,400 fake branded items seized during the raid, said Roslan.
Individuals convicted under the Trade Descriptions Act 2011 for selling fake goods can be fined up to a maximum of RM10,000 or jailed up to five years for each item.
Companies convicted for the same offence are liable to a maximum RM15,000 (S$6,000) fine.
