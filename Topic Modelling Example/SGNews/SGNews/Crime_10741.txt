KUALA LUMPUR - The Home Ministry Youth Squad will become a main platform in providing opportunities to the younger generation in contributing to society through its programmes and activities.
This was announced by Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein yesterday at the launch of a special gathering at the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park.
"The spirit of volunteerism among 15,000 youths here today will be driven and not stopped. It will carry on in future activities that are creative and innovative, and will develop the character and life focus of the younger generation."
Hishammuddin said members of the squad were free to come up with their own activities. He said it would sharpen their leadership qualities, management skills, and creative and critical thinking.
He added that the youth squad was open to those aged between 18 and 25, and was especially for those who wanted to help the ministry in fighting crime, preventing drug abuse and aiding victims of disasters.
The gathering also included members from the ministry's agencies such as the People's Volunteers Corps, Civil Defence Department, National Anti-Drug Agency and volunteer police from public higher-learning institutions.
On the recent spate of abduction cases in the country, Hishammuddin said they were "isolated".
"The country's overall crime rate has seen no increase," he said, adding that the cases should not be blown out of proportion.
Hishammuddin added that the recent cases of crime did not affect progress in the National Key Result Areas.
