Top Malaysian pop star Michael Wong and his peers are going green.
"We're concerned about our Earth and it's important to preserve green spaces to ensure a better living environment," said Wong, who initiated the Going Green project.
Other singers Lin Kah Jun, Yu Heng, Orange Tan and three-member group Da.Mon.Ster - comprising Danny Wan, Monkey D and Ester Maymay - also play their part in nature conservation.
Wan wrote the theme song for the project and has been an eco-friendly person all along.
To prove their commitment to environmental protection, the artistes said they would try their best to quit eating meat and other processed food to reduce contaminated waste and pollution.
"I can do it&hellip; but I have to reduce (eating meat) gradually," Lin said at the launch of the project on Tuesday.
As a start, a total of 100 trees will be planted in three schools in Kuala Lumpur - SJKC Taman Rashna, SJKC On Pong 2 and SJKC Chung Hwa (P).
A 'green corner' has also been set up at the north atrium of Viva Home mall in Cheras until Aug 17, with an aim to educate children on the importance of environmental sustainability.
There's more. A music showcase will be held at Kenanga Wholesale City on Aug 18 to support the campaign.
Passes to the event can be obtained by purchasing Going Green packages, priced at RM80 (S$32), RM130, RM180 and RM240.
Each package include a goodie bag, a mini pot plant and a pass to the music showcase.
