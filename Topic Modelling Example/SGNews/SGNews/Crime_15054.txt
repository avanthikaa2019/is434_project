A total of 44 men have been arrested in connection with a case of commercial sex with a minor.
The police confirmed that they will be charged in court today under Section 376B(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 for prostitution of minor under 18.
The suspects - which includes high ranking men from both public and private organisations - were allegedly involved with an online vice ring that employed an underage girl, reported The Straits Times.
Comprising both bachelors and married men, they range in age from their 20s to 50s.
While prostitution is generally allowed in Singapore, paying for sex with a girl under 18 carries a maximum penalty of seven years in jail and a fine.
A lawyer who spoke to The Straits Times said his clients were believed to have paid for sex with a Singaporean girl two years ago.
The paper reports that phone records had linked some of the men to the girl, who was one of the social escorts whose services were being advertised online.
