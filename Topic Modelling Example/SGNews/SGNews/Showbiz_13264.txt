Ever-popular Channing Tatum seems to be in every other film these days.
In this update of a late-1980s TV series, he plays former high-school hipster, Jenko, whose police partner is his nerdy former classmate Schmidt (Jonah Hill).
But he is now the Science geek while Schmidt turns "cool", as they go undercover in a high school and get reacquainted with current youth culture.
After the initial laughs, things fall apart as prom night beckons and a perfunctory ending wraps up the film.
