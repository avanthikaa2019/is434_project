JAKARTA - The pilot of the Sukhoi Superjet 100 that crashed into Mount Salak in Bogor, West Java, was one of the best in Russia, according to the aircraft's maker.
The statement, made by United Aircraft Company (UAC) president Mikhail Pogosyan on Friday, apparently contradicts Russian media reports that said the crash was most likely due to pilot error.
"I know the pilot who flew this Sukhoi Superjet 100 so well," Pogosyan told reporters though a translator at Halim Perdanakusuma airport in East Jakarta.
"As an aviator, Alexander Yablontsev was one of the best in the country. He started from zero until he earned a [flight] certificate from the Russian authorities. He has always been one of the best," Pogosyan said.
Prior to the crash, Yablontsev requested permission from air-traffic controllers to descend from 10,000 feet to 5,900 feet, lower than Mt.Salak, which stands at 7,254 feet.
It was Yablontsev's first time flying in Indonesia, according to reports.
