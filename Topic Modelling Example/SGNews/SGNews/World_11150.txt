BERLIN/TOKYO - Finance chiefs of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrialised powers were to hold emergency talks on the euro- zone debt crisis later yesterday in a sign of heightened global alarm about the threat posed by strains inside the 17-nation monetary union.
With Greece, Ireland and Portugal all under international bailout programmes, financial markets are anxious about the risks from a Spanish banking crisis and fret that a Greek election on June 17 could lead Athens to leave the single currency and precipitate yet more economic turbulence.
"We have reached a point where we need to have a common understanding about the problems we are facing," Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi told reporters.
Earlier, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said ministers and central bankers of the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, Germany, France and Italy would hold a special conference call, raising pressure on the Europeans to act.
Toronto and Washington both called for more action.
"Markets remain sceptical that the measures taken thus far are sufficient to secure the recovery in Europe and remove the risk that the crisis will deepen," White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.
A G-7 source familiar with plans for the call, likely to be held late in the Asian night, said the group would urge more progress at a European Union summit on June 28 and 29, though this alone would probably disappoint global markets.
