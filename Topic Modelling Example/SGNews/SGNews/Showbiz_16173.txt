SINGAPORE - British ska veterans The Specials and American funk/R&amp;B outfit Earth, Wind And Fire proved their mettle at the third edition of Timbre's Rock &amp; Roots Festival at Marina Promenade last Friday and Saturday.
Acts like guitar stalwart Buddy Guy also performed last Friday, while The Specials got the crowd revved up to popular numbers like Monkey Man.
Despite some technical hiccups during New Orleans horn player Trombone Shorty's set last Saturday, Earth, Wind And Fire served up pitch-perfect, energetic renditions of hits like September and Let's Groove.
Some 7,800 attended over both days.
