Sexy young artiste Syatilla Melvin confessed to starring in a "hot" 1.47-minute video clip, reported Mingguan Malaysia.
The 21-year-old said friends shot the video for a coursework that involved video recording.
"Why should I deny its existence when I am the person in the video?'' she said, adding she did "not want to live in denial".
Syatilla, who is fondly known as Tilla, said she believed in honesty.
"I am not upset, but rather disappointed over the negative comments from people who have watched the clip," she said.
In the video, Syatilla dances provocatively to Doris Day's 1960s hit Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps.
