BUDAPEST - The Hungarian parliament on Wednesday confirmed Janos Ader, a co-founder of Hungary's ruling Fidesz party and close ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, as the country's new president.
Ader, 52, who was nominated by Orban last month after Pal Schmitt stepped down over a plagiarism scandal, received a majority votes in the Fidesz-controlled parliament as expected.
The far-right Jobbik voted against him however, while other opposition parties, including the Socialists, the Green LMP and a new faction led by former prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany boycotted the vote.
Ader was sworn in immediately after he was confirmed and will formally assume office on May 10.
A lawyer by training and European deputy since 2009, he was also leader of Fidesz's parliamentary group from 2002 to 2006.
A mostly ceremonial role, the Hungarian president is nevertheless the head of the army and must sign all legislation into law after it has been approved by parliament.
Ader's predecessor Schmitt resigned as president in early April after he was stripped of his 1992 doctorate for plagiarism.
