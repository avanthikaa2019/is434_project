More than half of computer users in Singapore admit that they download and use illegal software.
A survey of more than 500 computer users here also found that women are just as likely as men to download and use pirated software.
Out of those who admitted to using illegal software, half are between the age of 18 and 34.
The study was conducted by US-based research firm Ipsos Public Affairs earlier this year, and included 15,000 computer users worldwide, reported The Straits Times.
