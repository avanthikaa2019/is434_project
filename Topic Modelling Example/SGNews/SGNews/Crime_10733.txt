SINGAPORE - A former events manager of 101 Hair Consultants was fined a total of $25,000 on Monday for corruption, reported The Straits Times.
Faymond Huang Zhiming, 38, pleaded guilty to two charges of getting $1,300 and $1,500 from Mr Teo Kah Siong, who owns JR Concept Enterprise, and two other charges of getting $3,500 and $1,400 from Ms Seah Sok Hong, a director of Hemus Pacific, as rewards to rent commercial space from the companies for 101 Hair Consultants.
Both firms were in the business of renting open commercial spaces at shopping centres and letting them to companies holding roadshows.
The court heard that in 2008, he agree to accept from Ms Seah and Mr Teo a fee of $100 for each day that 101 Hair Consultants rented commercial spaces through the two companies.
Huang, currently a marketing manager of a local company, was ordered to pay a penalty of $10,200 equivalent to the total number of bribes he had accepted.
Five other similar charges were taken into consideration during his sentencing.
Huang could have been fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years on each bribery charge.
