NTUC FairPrice's iPhone app aims to simplify grocery shopping before customers step into the supermarket.
The My FairPrice app promptly provides money-saving tips and weekly promotional information at FairPrice's network of over 100 supermarkets, FairPrice Finest outlets and FairPrice Xtra hypermarkets to help customers keep within their grocery shopping budget.
It also provides customers with convenience at their fingertips, allowing them to create multiple shopping lists and even search for the nearest FairPrice store in their vicinity.
The first app of its kind in Singapore, the My FairPrice app is now available on iTunes app store.
