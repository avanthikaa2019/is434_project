CHANGI General Hospital (CGH) is turning to the private sector for the space it needs to handle the volume of patients it sees.
Within the next three months, it will begin to manage 30 beds in Parkway East Hospital.
Patients with stable acute medical conditions will be treated in a Parkway East ward with a mix of single and double rooms and a multiple-bed room.
These patients will receive all the care they require while continuing to pay the same hospital charges they would pay at CGH.
Subsidised patients will continue to receive their subsidies according to their admitted ward class.
The Parkway East ward will be staffed by CGH nurses, doctors and allied health professionals.
After discharge, the patients will continue their follow-up appointments with their doctors at CGH.
"We've taken great care to assure patients of a consistent level of care after their transfer," explained Associate Professor Low Cheng Ooi, Chairman of the CGH Medical Board.
"Only patients who are in a stable condition, such as those who require short-term rehabilitation will be considered for transfer. All of these patients' conditions will be continually reviewed and followed- up on by the CGH medical team."
He added: "CGH has started new facilities, expanded existing ones, and improved workflow to speed up the treatment process. They include setting up a nine-bed Short Stay Unit at (accident and emergency) and expanding our observation ward from 12 to 20 beds.
"We are also building an Integrated Building, a 250-bed facility between CGH and St. Andrew's Community Hospital. This building is targeted to be ready in 2014."
