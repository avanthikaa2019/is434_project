Chinese President Hu Jintao said yesterday that Beijing will offer US$10 billion (S$13 billion) in loans to the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
The SCO, founded in 2001, includes China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Iran, India, Pakistan and others attend the summits, but not as full members.
