LONDON - England striker Wayne Rooney is recovering from a minor injury but will be fully fit for his expected return during the group stages at Euro 2012, manager Roy Hodgson has revealed.
Rooney is suspended for England's opening Group D games against France and Sweden but is likely to come back into Hodgson's starting line-up for the final first round match against Ukraine.
Hodsgon revealed that the 26-year-old Manchester United star - who was photographed holidaying in Las Vegas on Saturday - would be excused from next week's friendly against Norway in Oslo.
He will then link up with England on May 29 in time for England's final warm-up game against Belgium at Wembley on June 2.
"Wayne has been playing with a minor injury for the last three or four games which needed a couple of weeks to clear up," said Hodgson.
"He won't be involved in the Norway game and I don't know whether I will select him for Belgium at this stage.
"I offered him a couple more days' rest but he was adamant he wanted to be part of it when we meet up for the Belgium game.
"The fitness side doesn't bother me. If he needs a bit of topping up we will do that. But his enthusiasm for the task was fantastic."
Hodgson meanwhile revealed he had decided against an approach to United veteran Paul Scholes for the Euros, believing England had enough options in midfield for the tournament.
"I am a great admirer, like everyone," Hodgson said. "If I was to select him it would have been a case of leaving out a (Frank) Lampard, a (Steven) Gerrard, or (Gareth) Barry, who have all played a big part in getting us there."
