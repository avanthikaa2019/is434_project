Members of the Teens Network Club (T-Net Club), a grassroots organisation for teens, will soon have access to a new fund to help them develop their talents.
Through the Teens Network Talent Fund, club members who show potential in areas such as dance and music, will get the chance to be trained by industry professionals.
The club currently lacks funds to send the teens for classes by professionals, and they are trained by alumni.
Said Mr Lee Hong Chuang, chairman of the T-Net advisory council: "Hopefully, this fund can further develop some of these teens with potential, regardless of whether they are in sports, in singing, in arts, in culture or even as masters of ceremony."
On Saturday, the fund will be officially launched by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, at the club's 10th-anniversary musical held at the National Library.
More than 50 T-Net Club members will be performing in the musical about teens coming together to participate in a talent competition. One of the lead actors, who may benefit from the fund, is 15-year-old Muhd Amirul Haziq Abdul Samad of Outram Secondary School. An avid dancer, Amirul is excited to be given this opportunity.
"I am excited as this is the first time I get to sing and dance on stage, and to show others what I am capable of," he said.
The club aims to raise $200,000 by the end of this year, announced chief executive director of People's Association, Mr Yam Ah Mee, at a media briefing held at its King George's headquarters yesterday. To start off its fund-raising efforts, the T-Net Club will be organising a charity golf event at Raffles Country Club tomorrow.
The T-Net Club was formed in November 2002 to provide opportunities for teens, aged 11 to 16 years old, to pursue their interests and develop their potential. There are currently 8,600 members, of whom 70 per cent come from low-income households living in one- to three-room flats.
