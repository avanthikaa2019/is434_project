PARIS - Nintendo's handheld 3DS device is going to get supersized, the company said on Friday, with a launch of the 3DS XL, featuring a screen 90 percent larger than the standard version.
The new device, to be released in Europe on July 28, will also broadcast 3D images viewable without special glasses and come with a longer lasting battery, the company said.
Nintendo's 3DS is world leader in the handheld device market, with 17 million units sold since its launch in early 2011. Nintendo had already upgraded the previous generation of handheld devices, the DSi, to the XL treatment.
Later this year, Nintendo is also planning an upgrade of its popular Wii device, the Wii U, whose joystick will feature a small screen.
