SINGAPORE - Independent Zeng Guoyan did not file his nomination papers after seeking clarifications about the qualifications to be a candidate in a parliamentary election.
It was reported earlier that Mr Zeng was barred from running in the by-election and that his papers were rejected by returning officer Yam Ah Mee.
Mr Zeng had told the media that he was barred from running because of a fine in 2008.
He had verbally abused police officers when they entered a shophouse he was in in 2008.
In 2011, the 58-year-old turned up alone at Tao Nan School, dressed in a yellow baju Melayu and a songkok. Later, he was seen tearing up the envelope which contained his application form and tossed it in the air.
When he was asked why, he said that he had been disqualified.
Mr Zeng, a seller of hair products, was the only independent candidate who received the political-donation certificate for this year's Hougang by-elections.
He was a WP candidate in the 1991 election. He has previous convictions for various crimes, including outrage of modesty.
Mr Zeng was jailed for three weeks in 2009 for putting up banners on escaped Jemaah Islamiah detainee Mas Selamat Kastari without permission. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to contest the General Election last year as an independent candidate in Mountbatten.
