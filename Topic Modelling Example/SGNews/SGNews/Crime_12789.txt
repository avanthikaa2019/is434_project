A woman in Pingtung County of southern Taiwan yesterday had a narrow escape from delivering a large sum of money to a con ring allegedly utilizing a new tactic to swindle money from victims, according to the Pingtung Police Precinct.
The woman, surnamed Chou, 51, recently went to a bank to withdraw NT$480,000 (S$20,400) from her account.
While receiving mobile phone calls from a con member, she tearfully handed an "SOS" message sheet to a bank worker, without answering any of the clerk's questions.
The clerk called the police for help.
When two policemen arrived at the bank, Chou still tearfully kept the mobile phone, and declined to tell the police what happened to her.
After hearing explanations from counter clerk, the police judged that Chou should be conned.
Later Chou told the police in a low voice that her son and husband were kidnapped by gangsters, and that she was withdrawing money as ransom.
The woman continued that she daren't talk should gangster kill her son and husband.
But the two policemen asked Chou not to withdraw the money on grounds that it's a new conning skill adopted by gangster, and joined forces with bank clerk to stop her from withdrawing money.
Chou responded by asking the police to take full responsibility should her son and husband suffer as a result of the failure of the ransom delivery.
