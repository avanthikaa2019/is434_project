If you want to know what's happening in the real Singapore in real time, you must get Stomp's faster and better iPhone app.
Since Version 1.5 of the app was released last Friday, it has seen over 1,500 new downloads.
Nearly 75,000 people have since updated their apps to the latest version.
To date, Stomp's iPhone app has racked up 320,000 downloads.
In addition to a refresh function for the list of stories, the updated Stomp iPhone app loads faster.
It also retains a user's information in the contribution and login screens for quicker submission of stories and comments.
This convenient way of reading and sharing news is the reason the app won the Best Mobile Application and Judges' Choice awards at the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation Awards in August last year.
Users are encouraged to update their Apple devices to iOS 5.1 or later to experience the Stomp iPhone app at its best.
Apart from its improved performance, Stompers will be pleased to know that their favourite elements of the app remain the same.
There is still the familiar loading screen and three options: To contribute a story, view the top talking points in Singapore Seen, or use the shortcut to get to the Stomp homepage.
The best thing is that the app remains free.
Stomp will also be rolling out an even better version of the app soon, so keep your eye on the App Store.
Android users, fret not.
Get your share of news on the go via the free Stomp Android app, which is available for download from Google Play.
So far, 30,000 Android smartphone users have downloaded the app.
