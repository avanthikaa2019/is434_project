China Press reported that Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung is determined not to get back with former husband Nicholas Tse.
"We are maintaining a good friendship now," Cheung told reporters in Guangzhou recently. "I do not want to change our current relationship. So please stop speculating."
The media had been rife with reports that Cheung was trying to get back with Tse.
When asked how she would celebrate Mother's Day, Cheung said she had ordered a bouquet of flowers for herself for the day.
