SINGAPORE - The cricket trio charged with housebreaking two weeks ago now face more charges.
Sisters Rajeswari and Vigineswari Pasupathy, aged 24 and 22 respectively, are believed to have broken into two Serangoon North Ave 1 flats to steal more than $48,000 worth of jewellery, cash and valuables.
This is on top of their initial charge of breaking into a Hougang Street 51 flat on May 17 this year.
School cricket coach Jeraj Puvaneshan, 26, is accused of allegedly helping to dispose $10,240 worth of stolen jewellery at a Chinatown pawnshop on Dec 21, 2009.
Puvaneshan is also believed to be involved in the Hougang house-breaking incident.
Rajeswari and Vigineswari Pasupathy are listed as members of the women's national squad on the Singapore Cricket Association website.
The trio were released after family members posted bail of $20,000 each.
The cases will be up for mention again on June 19.
