More than three decades after his death, the music of this Jamaican reggae icon still gets people grooving. This double-disc accompaniment to the Kevin McDonald-produced documentary about Marley's life consists of songs selected by family and his former label boss.
That means besides hits like Redemption Song (1980) and Stir It Up (1973), there are also lesser-known gems like Crazy Baldhead (1976).
OST: Marley (Universal)
