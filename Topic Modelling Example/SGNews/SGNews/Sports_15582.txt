ROME - Massimiliano Allegri has hit out at criticism of his AC Milan team after their 2-1 home defeat to Fiorentina on Saturday saw them lose the Serie A leadership.
Unbeaten Juventus now head the champions by a single point with seven games remaining.
But Allegri has been stung by the criticism that followed after his side blew a four-point lead 10 days ago with a 1-1 draw at Catania before Saturday's shock loss.
"There's too much negativity surrounding us, nothing is lost," said Allegri.
"It's excessive to say that Juventus are unbeatable and can kill the title race.
"There's still a long way to go but a lot of criticisms are raining down on us although we still have a great chance of winning the league.
"There are still seven games to go and if Juve had a good chance of winning when they were two points behind us then now that we're one behind we have even more chances."
Allegri also rubbished talk that he could resign or be fired in his second season at the Milan giants.
"I can't understand why a coach's position is called into question after one little blip," he said.
Allegri blamed the Fiorentina defeat on tiredness due to their involvement in the Champions League.
In midweek before the game they were beaten 3-1 by Barcelona at the Camp Nou.
It was the third week in a row in which Milan had faced a midweek game and Tuesday's clash away to Chievo will be their ninth match in less than a month.
"We paid for the efforts we made against Barcelona," he said.
"On Saturday we played at 3pm with a relatively high temperature, we slipped up but that can happen.
"We have to analyse the situation and start over."
