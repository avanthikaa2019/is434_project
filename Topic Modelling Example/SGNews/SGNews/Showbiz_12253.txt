"The Born This Way Ball" takes place on Friday at Rajamangala Stadium in the Hua Mak Sports Complex on Ramkhamhaeng Road.
Pol Maj-General Anant Srihiran said there were plans to cover everything from audience safety and traffic management to prevention of accidents, terror?ism and crime. He said the area of operations had been divided into three zones.
The inner zone of Rajamangala Stadium would see close dealings between police and the concert organisers to enforce tight security. Traffic barri?ers would secure routes for VIPs, while concert-goers would be subjected to thorough body searches for explosives or weapons.
Police would man a middle zone within the sports complex to inspect vehicles and incoming crowds, with officers positioned high up to check for long-range attacks.
Outside the complex, officers will man several checkpoints and be on the lookout for trajectory weapons, Anant said.
Closed-circuit cameras are also being positioned in the area.
Anant said first-aid equipment plus emergency vehicles and staff would be on standby at the concert.
