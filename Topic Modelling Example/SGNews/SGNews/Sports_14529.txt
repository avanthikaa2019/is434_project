About 10,000 runners were at The Float@Marina Bay yesterday morning to run for a world with lower carbon-dioxide levels through Run 350.
The run was organised by Young NTUC.
Part of the proceeds will go to the Garden City Fund Plant-A-Tree Programme, to add 50 more trees to the 579 planted over the last two years.
