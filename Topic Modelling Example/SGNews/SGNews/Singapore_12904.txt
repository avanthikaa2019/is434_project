SINGAPORE - The passenger in a taxi that was hit by a Ferrari which crashed into it on Saturday has been identified.
Ms Shigemi Ito, 41, was sent to the Singapore General Hospital after the accident at Bugis, but died shortly after.
Her parents and brother were seen at a funeral parlour at Sin Ming drive on Monday, where her wake was being held, reported The Straits Times. They declined to speak to the media.
Ms Ito was working and living in Singapore.
Friends of Ms Ito received an SMS yesterday from a man who signed off as T.C. Thio, informing them of her death and details of the wake.
The man also said in the message that he was her boyfriend.
The three-vehicle accident which involved a Ferrari, taxi and motorcycle also claimed two other lives - Ferrari driver Mr Ma Chi, 31, a private investor from Sichuan, and cabby Cheng Teck Hock, 52.
Mr Ma's female companion, believed to be in her 20s, is reportedly in stable condition at Tan Tock Seng hospital.
