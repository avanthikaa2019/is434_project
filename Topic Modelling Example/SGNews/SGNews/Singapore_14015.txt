Singapore restaurant Iggy's is ranked best in Asia in an international survey ranking the world's top 50 restaurants.
Ranked 26th on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list, the Oscars of the global restaurant industry, Iggy's edged out two Tokyo restaurants which placed higher than Iggy's last year.
Iggy's ranked highes than Les Creations de Narisawa (No. 27), and Nihonryori RyuGin (No. 28).
A second local restaurant Waku Ghin debuted on the coveted list at No. 39. The Straits Times reported that the restaurant is run by Sydney-based celebrity chef Tetsuya Wakuda, whose restaurant Tetsuya's fell 18 spots to No. 76 this year.
Two other Singapore restaurants also made it into the top 100 list. Les Amis moved up two spots to No. 53 while Restaurant Andre moved up 32 spots to rank 68th.
The list, compiled for a 10th year by more than 800 international experts for Britain's Restaurant magazine, was largely dominated by European restaurants.
The top three restaurants in the world remain the same as last year - Noma in Denmark is at No. 1, El Celler de Can Roca in Spain at No. 2, and another Spanish restaurant, Mugaritz, is No. 3.
From next year, the magazine will also be ranking restaurants across Asia and will launch a new list, Asia's 50 Best Restaurants. The first awards ceremony for the Asian list will take place in Singapore.
