A jobless woman who stabbed her husband while he was in hospital was fined $4,000 today.
Quek Chin Fern, 38, was visiting her husband Mr Lim Peng Kiang, 40, at Singapore General Hospital on September 22, 2011 when they got into an argument about his suspected infidelity.
Mr Lim was warded for acid burn injuries. He had been hospitalised after three unknown men assaulted him by splashing acid on him.
The attack was triggered by an argument, after Quek started talking about Mr Lim's acts of unfaithfulness and the problems he had brought to the family, reported The Straits Times.
This irritated Mr Lim, and the couple got into an argument.
She took out a knife from her bag and stabbed him several times on his shoulder, cheek and neck
The attack stopped only after a nurse saw what was happening and alerted security.
Quek's husband suffered multiple lacerations.
She could have been jailed up to two years and fined $5,000.
In mitigation, the mother of two was found by a doctor at the Institute of Mental Health to be suffering from depression for more than 10 years.
Her husband, who has recovered, is also supportive of her as he felt responsible for the assault.
Media reports said Mr Lim had previously caused a commotion in front of his alleged girlfriend's Bukit Timah house last year.
Mr Lim had reportedly accused his girlfriend's husband of sending people to beat him up and splash acid on his genitals for having an affair.
A woman came out of the house to talk to the man at the gate and told the man to stop creating a scene, but the man refused and continued shouting for her husband.
He also reportedly removed his pants to reveal an adult diaper, which he also pulled down to reveal his injured groin.
