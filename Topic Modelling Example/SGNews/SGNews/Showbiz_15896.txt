LOS ANGELES- A Brazilian-based movie company has acquired the rights to make a film adaptation of Bob Dylan's iconic album "Blood on the Tracks," an executive said Wednesday.
RT Features is seeking a director for an English-language movie based on the 1975 record, which includes Dylan classics like "Shelter from the Storm," "Tangled up in Blue" and "Simple Twist of Fate."
The Brazilian firm's senior vice-president Fernando Loureiro confirmed to AFP details reported by industry daily Variety, which said RT Features had sought rights from US firm Grey Water Park Productions.
"As longtime admirers of one of the greatest albums in the history of music, we feel privileged to be making this film," he confirmed chief executive Rodrigo Teixeira as saying.
"Our goal is to work with a filmmaker who can create a classic drama with characters and an environment that capture the feelings that the album inspires in all fans," he added.
"Blood on the Tracks" was Dylan's 15th studio album. The singer-songwriter denied that its bleak themes were autobiographical, but critics have seen it as reflecting the collapse of his his marriage.
Dylan, who turned 70 last year, said the album was inspired by short stories by classic Russian writer Anton Chekhov.
