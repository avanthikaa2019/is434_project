SINGAPORE - A Chinook helicopter landed on a field at National University of Singapore (NUS) yesterday morning, catching students by surprise.
The Ministry of Defence told my paper that a Republic of Singapore Air Force CH-47 Chinook helicopter was activated yesterday to evacuate a man on board a commercial vessel in the South China Sea.
The Chinook landed on the sports field at 9.08am, and the man was taken to National University Hospital (NUH) for emergency treatment.
NUS mathematics student Ang Zhi Yuan, 24, told my paper that after the chopper landed, he saw a person on stretcher-like equipment being transported to a nearby ambulance, which drove off in the direction of NUH.
The Chinook left within 10 minutes of landing.
"It's the first time I've seen a Chinook on the field," said Mr Ang, adding that he knows a Chinook had landed in NUS a few years ago.
An NUS spokesman said the authorities alerted the campus security before the helicopter landed.
The field was then cordoned off and security staff checked it for debris to ensure it was safe for landing.
Helicopters have done medical evacuations in the past.
In 2009, a full-time national serviceman on a Republic of Singapore Navy ship was evacuated by helicopter to the Singapore General Hospital after being trapped by a sliding door.
