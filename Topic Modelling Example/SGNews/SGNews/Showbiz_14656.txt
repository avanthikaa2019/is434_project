PETALING JAYA - Actress Zahida Rafik, who is accused of having an affair with a Cabinet minister, has threatened legal action against those implicating her.
She said on Twitter that she had already consulted her lawyers.

"My lawyers are in the midst of settling the matter. So let them handle it.
"Wait for the good news." she said in response to a tweet asking why she was not responding to the allegations.
Online portals reported on Wednesday that Zahida's driver, Noor Azman Azemi, had made a police report claiming that the actress received RM1.5mil from the minister over a span of four months.
PKR Wanita chief Zuraida Kamaruddin had highlighted the matter and distributed the police report to the media.
In the police report, the driver claimed that, among others, the actress received RM58,000(S$3261) last October, RM112,000 in November, RM330,000 in December and RM510,000 in January.
The actress responded to other Twitter users who ridiculed and accused her of receiving the money.
One user asked asked: "Are you the minister's mistress?
"It is no wonder then that you live so glamorously."
Zahida responded to almost every comment with statements like: "I have time to reply now while I wait at the bank for my millions" and "I feel sorry for my ex-driver, making up false stories just for money. May Allah bless him."
