SINGAPORE - Police have arrested a 41-year-old man for a case of snatch theft along Yung Sheng Road.
On June 19, a female victim was withdrawing money from an ATM located at Blk 359 Yung Sheng Road when the suspect approached her from the rear.
He then tried to grab her gold chain from her neck. The victim held on to her gold chain tightly and the gold chain snapped.
The suspect then fled without taking the gold chain and the victim immediately called the police.
Acting on the belief that the suspect might still be loitering around the vicinity, police officers conducted a thorough search in the vicinity of Taman Jurong estate.
The officers' efforts paid off when they spotted a male subject who fit the description at the void deck of Blk 322 Tah Ching Road.
The suspect was duly arrested.
He will be charged in court on June 21, and if found guilty, he can be imprisoned for up to seven years and caned.
