SEOUL - The K-pop girl group KARA has been chosen to receive an award as one of the key contributors to Korean tourism, the Korea Tourism Organisation said Tuesday.
The state run organisation said KARA would receive the award given to people, companies and popular tourist destinations for promoting Korea's image overseas and attracting foreign tourists.
The five-member female group has been active both in Japan and Korea, and has led the K-pop boom in Japan.
The group was selected as the most popular Korean singers in Japan in a poll conducted by the Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange in January this year.
Riding on KARA's popularity in the neighbouring country, the KTO has released a mobile application in multiple languages featuring members of the group.
Other recipients this year include Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon, the Geumgang pine forest, travel book "How far did you go in Korea?" and POSCO.
The ten award recipients will receive 5 million won (S$5,460) in prize money.
The award ceremony will be held on June 12.
