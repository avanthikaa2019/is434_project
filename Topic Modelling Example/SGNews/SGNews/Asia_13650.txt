JAPAN - The driver arrested for causing the bus accident that killed seven passengers on the Kanetsu Expressway on Sunday arranged another bus tour for Chinese tourists during his rest break at a hotel, according to sources close to a bus company he was working for.
The Gunma prefectural police suspected that the driver, 43-year-old Kazan Kono, did not get sufficient rest as a result of engaging in private business during his break.
According to the sources, Kono started driving a bus from Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, on the night of April 27, and dropped off his last passengers in Kanazawa the following morning.
Kono then checked into a hotel in Ishikawa Prefecture before 9am. However, instead of resting, Kono was said to have been busy organizing his own bus tour for Chinese tourists until 4.30pm.
Though he told police he alternated between sleeping and waking at the hotel, they suspect Kono did not get sufficient sleep because he was busy arranging his own tour.
A lawyer for bus operator Rikuentai in Inzai, Chiba Prefecture, said Kono rents a bus from the company and organizes his own tours for Chinese visitors. As the bus was in for repair work, it had been three days since Kono had last worked.
The bus involved in the accident was not the same bus.
According to Kono's lawyer, he ate and slept in the bus after he left the hotel at 4:30 p.m. The lawyer quoted him as saying: "I took the Kanetsu Expressway because I'd never used the Joshinetsu Expressway before. I lost consciousness right before the accident."
However, the lawyer who met with Kono said he looked healthy.
"I don't think he lacked sleep [at the time of the accident]," the lawyer said.
