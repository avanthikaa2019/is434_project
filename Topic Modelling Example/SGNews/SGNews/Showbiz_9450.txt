They were so hush-hush, nobody even knew they were a couple in the first place.
But US actor Giovanni Ribisi, 37, and British supermodel Agyness Deyn, 29, have made their whirlwind romance official - by eloping, reported Us Weekly magazine.
According to Ribisi's rep, they "quietly married in Los Angeles over the weekend".
Just two months ago, Ribisi split from US singer- girlfriend Chan Marshall, better known by her stage name Cat Power, whom he had been dating since 2009.
