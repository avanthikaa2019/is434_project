IT WILL be the last major tournament before the London Olympics in July.
And the Li-Ning Singapore Open, to be held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium from June 19 to 24, will be a test for the London-bound Singaporeans.
Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) senior technical manager Chua Yong Joo said: "The competition will give them a good gauge of what improvements they have made, since we've been working on their weaknesses over the years.
"It'll be a test for our shuttlers to see where they stand."
The Republic's Olympic nominees - Derek Wong, Gu Juan, Shinta Mulia Sari and Yao Lei - will take part in the US$200,000 ($250,000) tournament, which is part of the Osim Badminton World Federation (BWF) World SuperSeries.
While top players such as Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei will miss the tournament, the likes of 2004 Olympic gold-medallist Taufik Hidayat and women's singles world No. 2 and defending champion Wang Xin, have confirmed their participation.
Women's doubles pair Shinta and Yao are hoping to put on a good showing after being eliminated in the last 16 last year.
Shinta, who won the women's doubles gold with Yao in 2010, said: "We want to do better than last year, where our results weren't very good.
"But we've improved since then and are more confident, and hopefully that will give us a boost at the Singapore Open."
