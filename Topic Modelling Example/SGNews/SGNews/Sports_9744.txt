LISBON - Cristiano Ronaldo made the front pages of all the sporting and main newspapers in Portugal on Friday after his goal against the Czech Republic sealed a semi-final spot at Euro 2012.
&ldquo;The best player in the world was once again the difference,&rdquo; said the sports daily A Bola, once again comparing the Real Madrid player to his main rival, Barcelona's Argentinian match-winner Lionel Messi.
&ldquo;He (Ronaldo) is the best in the world,&rdquo; said Record on its front page, adding that &ldquo;it was shaping up to be his Euro&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Unstoppable... magic... ,&rdquo; A Bola ran out of adjectives to describe Ronaldo's performance, having already been in raptures over his match-winning brace against the Netherlands in the final group stage match.
&ldquo;Golden CR7: a goal and classy performance opens the way to the semis,&rdquo; said Correio da Manha.
&ldquo;Super-Ronaldo puts Portugal one match from the final,&rdquo; wrote the Diario de Noticias, although for Publico, &ldquo;Ronaldo missed a few clear chances but he showed his limitless repertoire&rdquo;.
The praise in the press did not stop at Ronaldo, with the Diario lauding Paulo Bento's team which &ldquo;once again brought out its big guns: a fantastic Cristiano Ronald, a limitless patience and an irreproachable organisation&rdquo;.
&ldquo;A footballing one-man show paves the way to the semis,&rdquo; considered Public, adding that &ldquo;Paulo Bento is responsible for a team that plays like a team, with intelligence and courage&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The Selecao played a perfect match,&rdquo; added the Correio da Manha.
Portugal will play the winners of Saturday's meeting between European and world champions Spain and France, injecting a note of caution in to a jubilant Portuguese media.
&ldquo;Now it's going to hurt,&rdquo; said the Diario, while A Bola said: &ldquo;Spain or France, two giants... another 90 minutes of suffering.&rdquo;
In five semi-finals in major competitions, Portugal have only ever reached the final once when the country hosted Euro 2004 and on three occasions (Euro 1984, Euro 2000 and the 2006 World Cup), France have beaten them, Record noted.
Spain would be an &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; opponent, even if they did send Portugal out of the last World Cup, said the Diario, adding: &ldquo;This team deserves to match up to the best and is ready to do so.&rdquo;
More confident still was the newspaper i, which turned the question on its head: &ldquo;Who dares to take us on? Spain or France?&rdquo;
