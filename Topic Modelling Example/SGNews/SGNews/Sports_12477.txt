ROME - Two weeks of late nights and big wins finally caught up with Roger Federer, as the world number two now looks forward to a few days of family time and relaxation after exiting in the semi-final of the Rome Masters.
The Swiss father of two won Madrid last week and dominated on the red clay of the Foro Italico this week until running into Novak Djokovic, who beat him 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).
But the 16-time grand slam champion admits that having a few days of normal living before the French Open begins next Sunday is more than inviting.
"I'm very excited but very tired," said the winner of an ATP-leading four titles this season, including Masters 1000 honours in Indian Wells and Madrid.
"I've been living and breathing tennis every day. I'm looking forward to some days off and getting ready for Paris.
"I'm happy in some ways that the event is over for me."
Federer said that he's keen to get back to family life. "We've got two kids running, they're growing up. We have a lot on our plate. This is the best time of my life and I wouldn't change it for anything.
"But I like to put the kids to bed and that's impossible with the schedule I've had over the last two weeks. Don't feel bad for me, I'm okay with it all.
"I've probably had night sessions for the last 10-11 nights, it catches up with you, but at least you can sleep in.
"I'm not complaining but you need that dinner and time to relax and not have to go to bed right away. It's tough and it's always been that way but I love it."
Federer goes to Paris with wins in eight of nine clay contests. "The clay season has been great so far. I knew I wouldn't win both (Madrid and Rome), I actually expected this final (Djokovic-Nadal).
"I'm just happy the tournament is over for the moment."
