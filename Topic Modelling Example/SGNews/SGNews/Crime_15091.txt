KUALA LUMPUR - Three suspected robbers were shot dead by police at Bulatan Bilion, Cheras, after a 1km car chase yesterday.
The men, aged between 24 and 40, are believed to be responsible for a jewellery shop heist in Shah Alam on April 6.
They were spotted in a black Proton Exora, near a private hospital, about 11.30am.
A team of policemen, set up to nab the gang, tried to stop the car before the driver sped away towards the Middle Ring Road 2 highway.
City Criminal Investigation Department chief Datuk Ku Chin Wah said the suspects' vehicle rammed into two other cars during their bid to escape.
However, the police managed to stop them near a roundabout.
One of the suspects, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, took out a Glock semi-automatic pistol before firing several shots at the police.
Police returned fire. Two of the suspects died at the scene while another succumbed to his injuries at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital.
Ku said police also found several parang and methamphetamine in the car, which was reported stolen in Kajang.
"Police are still investigating if the gang has more members who are on the loose."
The New Sunday Times was at the scene.
One of the suspects' body, believed to be the gunman, was lying on the road with one of his legs inside the car.
The Proton Exora was surrounded by four unmarked police cars, with its windscreen riddled with bullet holes.
The incident also saw a 5km traffic jam for about three hours on the MRR2 from both directions.
