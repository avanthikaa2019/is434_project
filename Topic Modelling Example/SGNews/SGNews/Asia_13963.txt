Labour unions in different cities across Indonesia have pledged to stage massive rallies in different places on May Day, which falls on Tuesday.
Bekasi-based Labour activist Obon Tabroni confirmed on Sunday that some 35,000 Labourers from Bekasi would join the May Day massive rally in the heart of Jakarta.
"We will meet at the Bundaran HI traffic circle at 7:30 a.m. and march to the Presidential Palace. We will end the long march at the Bung Karno stadium to join a massive Labour meeting," Obon told The Jakarta Post.
He added that up to 100,000 Labourers from across the Greater Jakarta area would join the yearly event and demand that the government revise the remuneration system and eliminate outsourcing practices, among others.
In Yogyakarta, thousands of Labourers from four regencies in the province would march from Abu Bakar Ali park to the House of Regional Representatives' office via Jl. Malioboro.
"Not only Labourers, but students and human rights activists have also expressed their willingness to join the long march," Yogyakarta Labourers Alliance secretary general Kirnadi said.
The Yogyakarta long march is aimed at reiterating workers' demand of eight working hours for Labourers.
"We also want to remind the President to implement the social security scheme for all Indonesian citizens in January 2014," he said.
Yogyakarta Labour activist Diniyah said that Labourers and activists held a cultural event on Sunday, which included mass prayer and poetry reading, as preparation ahead of the rally.
