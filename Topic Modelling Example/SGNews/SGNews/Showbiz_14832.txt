INDIA - Aspiring Nepalese actress Meenakshi Thapa came to Bollywood to further her career but ended up being murdered.
Tamil Nesan reported that the 26-year-old was kidnapped and beheaded last month by struggling actors she had befriended on the set of Madhur Bhandarkar's yet-to-be-released film Heroine, where she had a bit role.
Her killers, Amit Jaiswal and his lover Preeti Elvina Surin, strangled and beheaded her, dumped her torso in a water tank and carried the severed head in a bag to Allahabad before throwing it out of a moving bus.
Amit and Preeti said they were taken in by Meenakshi's stories about her affluent family and wanted to kidnap her for ransom.
The duo asked Meenakshi to travel with them to Gorakhpur, where they held her hostage and called her family asking for a ransom of Rs1.5million (S$36,000)
Police said the duo told Meenakshi's mother that they would drug her daughter and make a pornographic film if she didn't pay up.
