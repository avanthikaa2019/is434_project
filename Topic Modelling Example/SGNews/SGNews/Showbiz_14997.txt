South Korean rock band CN Blue's Lee Jung Shin was set to make an appearance at Men's Fashion Week tomorrow, but will no longer be able to come to Singapore due to scheduling conflicts, said organisers.
Lee was meant to attend the Songzio show. In a letter to organisers, his management team said that the star was "devastated" that he could not make the trip.
