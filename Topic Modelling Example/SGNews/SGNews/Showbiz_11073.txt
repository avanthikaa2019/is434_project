As onscreen lovers - a terminally ill college student and a macho rock singer - eye candies Angelababy and Mark Chao share a searing chemistry.
But right from the start, this romantic film is weighed down by too many coincidences and cliches, despite its whimsical addition of animation to liven up some scenes.
A midway twist in the film helps to explain its earlier perceived flaws, but the story then suffers from another problem - dragging on without knowing when to stop.
FIRST TIME (PG) Romance/103 minutes Rating: 2/5 stars
