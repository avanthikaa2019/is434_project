It's just a day before the my paper Executive 2012 finalists hit the stage.
To help you get to know some of them a bit better, we've compiled some fun facts.
Take petite Goh Xin Lei, 24.
She is a "chilli padi" who believes in leading an adventurous and fulfilling life. The business consultant has big plans for the years ahead.
She intends to get her dive licence by the end of the year, complete the Tokyo Marathon in February next year, and trek to Mount Everest Base Camp by 2014.
Ms Geargina Tan, 27, is another plucky lass. She wields a black belt in taekwondo, a sport she has been involved in since she was 17.
She said: "Being a fighter taught me perserverence and the importance of self-motivation. I use the same set of beliefs in my work."
Mr Marcus Tay has big dreams, too. He wants to climb a mountain - and play a flute on the top of it.
The 29-year-old environmental- sustainability executive is already an avid trekker. He has trekked in mountains such as Gunung Tahan and Gunung Stong in Malaysia.
"Going out to nature brings a certain peace and calm to me," said Mr Tay.
But learning to play the Chinese flute is one of the things on his bucket list to try to develop his "zero artistic and musical talent".
Look out, ladies, he has a dimple on his right cheek.
Then there is the laidback Austen Chan, 28, an architectural assistant. He may not look it but he is an all-round daredevil who loves extreme sports.
He surfs, snowboards, and has been doing aggressive inline skating for more than 10 years.
These activities "bring me to another place mentally because they allow me to forget about my worldly troubles," he said.
They also fit into his life as a young, driven executive.
"It is only through risks and taking chances that we are able to achieve things way beyond our expectations. But the more important lesson is how to get up after a fall," he said wisely.
