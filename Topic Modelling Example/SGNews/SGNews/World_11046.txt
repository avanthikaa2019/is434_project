SYDNEY - An Indian man who strangled his wife then slit her throat at least eight times was jailed for six years in Australia Thursday, sparking outrage from the victim's sister.
Chamanjot Singh, 24, launched a frenzied attack on his wife in December 2009, first strangling her then cutting her throat repeatedly, the New South Wales Supreme Court heard.
He said he "lost it" after his wife verbally abused him and said she loved another man.
Singh was found not guilty of murder, after the jury accepted his argument that he was provoked, but convicted of manslaughter with Justice Peter McClellan sentencing him to six years in jail.
The judge said Singh had been an immature young man, far from his family in India, and did not have the personal resources to deal with his deteriorating marriage.
Outside court, the victim's angry sister, Jaspreet Kaur, criticised the sentence, telling reporters there was "very bad law in Australia".
"I am not happy," she wept, claiming her brother-in-law lied when he told the jury her sister was having an affair.
"They believed it (but) they did not have any proof, they didn't show anything in the court, they don't know who the guy is," she said.
