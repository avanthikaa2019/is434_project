Amid disco lights at the Singapore Island Country Club bowling alley last night, the Canon Platinum Series was launched for senior-management executives to socialise and build their network of business partners.
The series is a by-invitation- only event in support of the Singapore Sports Vision 2030 project by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, which seeks to promote wellness and better living through sports.
Mr Chan Chun Sing, the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, launched the series yesterday, and urged participants to incorporate sports into their lives, despite their busy schedules.
He added: "Not only is sports a great way to relax and have a good time, but it can also offer opportunities for companies and sports associations to synergise their capabilities."
The Canon Platinum Series comes in the fourth season of the Canon SuperSeries, a corporate bowling series which has seen more than 500 companies taking part.
Said Mr Von Chan, director and general manager of the Business Imaging Solutions and Business Solutions division of Canon Singapore: "We want to provide a platform to encourage people to actively participate in sports and, in the process, transform into happier individuals and stronger leaders."
