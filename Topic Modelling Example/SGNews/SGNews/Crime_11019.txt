Police have arrested a 34-year-old man for taking an upskirt photo of a female victim after he was caught red-handed by a member of the public yesterday afternoon.
On Jun 6, 2012 at about 5pm, the suspect positioned his mobile phone under the skirt of a 23-year-old woman standing in front of him while on an escalator at a shopping mall along Jurong Gateway Road.
A vigilant 38-year-old man spotted the suspect's actions and immediately alerted the victim and detained the suspect.
The suspect was subsequently handed over to responding police officers from Clementi Police Division.
Investigations against the suspect are ongoing.
If found guilty of Insulting the Modesty of a Woman, the suspect faces imprisonment which may extend to one year, or a fine, or both.
Acting Commander of Clementi Police Division, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Rosalind Khoo, commended the member of public for his public-spiritedness and assistance in detaining the suspect until police arrived.
