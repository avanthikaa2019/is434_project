EAST JAVA - East Java Police have arrested a man suspected to have forged 1,661 diplomas since 2007.
"We are currently looking for accomplices, because there is no way the suspect, Sucipto, 48, could have acted alone," East Java Police intellectual property rights unit chief Comr. Andy Arisandi said.
The suspect was charged with violating Article 67 of Law No. 20/2003 on the national education system and could face up to 10 years in prison and a Rp 1 billion (S$135,000) fine.
He could also be charged with breaching Article 68 of the same law, which carries a penalty of five years in prison and a Rp 500 million fine.
Of the 1,661 fake diplomas that Sucipto allegedly made, 62 per cent were Akta IV certifications for teaching. Some 31 per cent were bachelor's degrees. Four per cent were master's degrees and one per cent of the forgeries were doctoral degrees.
The documents contained the replicated stamps of several universities in East Java, including Merdeka University in Malang and Darul Ulum University in Jombang.
Sucipto allegedly charged Rp 12.5 million for a single Akta IV certificate or bachelor's degree, while a master's degree cost Rp 20 million and a doctoral degree cost Rp 70 million, kompas.com reported on Thursday.
