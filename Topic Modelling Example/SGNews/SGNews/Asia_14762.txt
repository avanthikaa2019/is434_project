The government has decided to extend a grant of about 250 million yen to Myanmar to help the democratizing country foster young bureaucrats by having them study in Japan, according to government sources.
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda will announce the plans when he holds talks with Myanmar President Thein Sein, scheduled for Saturday in Tokyo, the sources said Wednesday.
To support Myanmar's democratization, the government will accept about 20 young bureaucrats from Myanmar who will attend institutions such as graduate schools to study law, administrative systems, policy-making and other subjects.
The Myanmar government is making efforts to introduce democracy, the principles of a market economy and measures to fight poverty. But it has a severe shortage of qualified people for these tasks.
The bureaucrats may also study in other areas, such as finance and industrial and agricultural development, the sources said.
