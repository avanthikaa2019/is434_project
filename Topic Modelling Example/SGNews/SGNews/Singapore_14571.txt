SINGAPORE - Police have arrested a 33-year-old man for stealing a vehicle he rented before from a car rental company located along Lor Marzuki.
On April 1, a staff of the rental company lodged a police report stating that one of its vehicles parked outside had gone missing the day before.
Following the report, police officers conducted extensive investigative probes and ground enquiries.
The suspect was established to be a customer who had rented the vehicle previously.
He became uncontactable after defaulting on the rental payment and failing to return vehicle. However, the rental company managed to locate it and towed it back.
The suspect was difficult to track down as he did not reside at his registered address.
On April 19 at about 1 pm, the officers' efforts finally paid off when they located the vehicle inside the compound of a private house along Upper Thomson Rd.
On April 20 at 9.15 am, the suspect was traced and arrested at the Harbour Front Ferry Terminal.
The suspect will be charged in Court on April 23. If convicted, he faces an imprisonment term of up to seven years. He is also liable to be fined and faces another charge of failing to report a change of address under the National Registration Act.
The police advised all car owners to secure their vehicles with an anti-theft system at all times, even if they are left unattended for just a short while.
Car owners should also secure their vehicles with an additional locking device, such as steering locks, if possible.
