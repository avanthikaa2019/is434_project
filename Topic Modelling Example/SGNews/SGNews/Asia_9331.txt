MANILA - Philippines-House minority leader Danilo Suarez lamented the government's pushing of its Kindergarten to 12 (K-12) program, questioning its capability of effectively implementing the new education program when it could not do so with the earlier 10-year program.
He recounted visiting a school in Quezon province that he represents, citing existing "back-to-back classrooms for Grades 1 and 2."
He said in jest that a plus when it came to Grade 1 pupils sharing classrooms with Grade 2 pupils was that they inevitably saw lessons taught in the higher level.
"Nakakatawa pero nakakalungkot (It's funny but it's sad at the same time). And that has been my point (regarding the K-12 program). We are being too ambitious," Suarez added, saying that shortages in classrooms, school supplies, and teachers should be resolved first.
He pointed out that the government could not even successfully implement earlier 10-year basic education program and it would mean that the additional two years for senior high school would only "cost money, teachers, classrooms."
Despite being the lone Southeast Asian country with a 10-year basic education program, Suarez insisted that what the government should work on was achieving satisfactory results with the old program.
"We survived with the 10-year program. Ayusin muna natin ito (Let's fix this first). Why are we being so ambitious?"
The Department of Education started implementing its K-12 program June this year.
