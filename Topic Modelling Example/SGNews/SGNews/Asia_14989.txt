BRUNEI - Following its precautionary landing last Sunday evening, the country's flag carrier Royal Brunei Airlines (RBA) flight BI098 has departed Mumbai, India at 3.12pm yesterday with estimated time of arrival in the Sultanate at 11.10pm (Brunei time) last night.
An aircraft system alert, referred to as AFT Cargo Fire, necessitated the RBA Boeing 777-200 on flight number BI098, which flew from Dubai, to divert to the nearest airport.
The flight landed safely in Mumbai at 7.24pm last Sunday.
A statement from RBA yesterday stated that the flight to Bandar Seri Begawan experienced a slight delay due to the aircraft requiring additional time to ensure that it was serviceable. It stressed that RBA prioritises the safety of its passengers.
"Royal Brunei Airlines could confirm that no passengers were injured," the statement read.
RBA also arranged travel itineraries for passengers' onward journeys to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Melbourne, Singapore, and Surabaya.
For passengers who would not be able to make same-day connections would stay overnight and RBA would provide transport and accommodation.
