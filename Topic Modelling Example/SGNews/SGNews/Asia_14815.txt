The growing number of suburban students in Southwest China's Yunnan province is leading to a transportation shortage, as a severely overloaded bus was forced to let students out through the windows, local media reported.
Some 13 students were found jumping out the bus windows after the car stopped at a suburban station in Mengzi county, southwestern Yunnan province, on April 12, 2012.
The students said they were told to get off this way by the driver as the door could not be opened due to overcrowding.
The 17-seat vehicle was carrying more than 70 passengers.
The students were all from a primary school in the suburbs of the county. Many of their parents are migrant workers downtown who enrolled them in the outskirts as schools in the central areas are full.
The educational bureau and public security department of Mengzi county said they will address the situation with a local bus company.
