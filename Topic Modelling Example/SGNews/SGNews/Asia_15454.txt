THAILAND - A pharmaceutical company in Lat Phrao district was raided yesterday after it was found to have manufactured pseudoephedrine cold pills for a Chiang Mai hospital and a clinic where tens of thousands were believed to have been diverted to ya ba labs.
Milano Factory cooperated with agents from the Public Health Ministry and the Food and Drugs Administration, said Phasit Sakdanarong, an adviser to the ministry.
The company produced authentic purchase orders for the medicine by Siam Rat Chiang Mai Hospital and Samphan Clinic, he said.
Those documents as well the clinic's would be verified, he said.
Samphan Clinic had bought 40,000 pseudoephedrine based tablets from Milano and more of them from other companies, and now could not account for them.
"We are finding out whether a Milano representative who sold the tablets to the clinic has a connection with those other drugmaking companies," he said.
Following complaints from patients and pharma companies over the supply of the cold relief medicine, he consulted with Public Health Minister Withaya Buranasiri over whether the ban against sales of pseudoephedrine based medicines could be lifted after the situation had settled down, he said.
Sansern Palawatwichai, a deputy chief of the Department of Special Investigation, said it was now apparent that drugrelated crimes had been committed in the case of the three hospitals where huge numbers of pseudoephedrine tablets had gone missing.
Those involved could be charged with drugrelated offences once more evidence against them was gathered in the next round of interviews, he said.
The three hospitals are Udon Thani General Hospital, Thong Saen Khan Hospital in Uttaradit and an unidentified private institution in an unspecified province.
