LONDON - Manchester United central defender Rio Ferdinand is set to miss out on Euro 2012 when new England manager Roy Hodgson announces his squad on Wednesday media reports claimed on Tuesday.
The 33-year-old will not make the squad because of worries over his longstanding back problem but his absence will ease tension within the squad as fellow central defender and former England skipper John Terry faces trial after the championship for allegedly racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton.
It will more than likely also bring down the curtain on Ferdinand's 81 cap career with his last appearance coming in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland last June.
Also apparently due to miss out is Spurs defender and PFA Young Player of the Year Kyle Walker because of a broken toe which was originally thought not to be serious enough so as to cost him his place at the championship.
Hodgson, who emerged out of the blue to take a post many thought was going to Harry Redknapp, is also set to cancel the training camp in Spain that had been organised by caretaker coach Stuart Pearce.
Instead of a training camp Hodgson wants the players to rest ahead of their warm-up match with Norway in Oslo on May 26.
England are in Group D along with old foes France, co-hosts Ukraine and Sweden.
