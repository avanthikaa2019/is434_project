INDIA - A man killed his six-year-old son when his wife refused to give him money to buy alcohol.
The incident occurred at the Sambakulam village on the outskirts of Madurai in Tamil Nadu.
P. Sundarajan threw his two children into a well after his wife T. Jayachithra, who supports the family with her meagre income as a labourer, refused to give him any money for alcohol.
The couple had quarrelled on Thursday morning when Sundarajan demanded money.
He threatened to kill the children but she ignored him and left their son and daughter at a nursery before leaving for work.
At about 10.30am, Sundarajan picked up his children from the nursery and took them to a farm nearby and threw them into the well before fleeing.
Villagers who saw him taking his children and returning without them, suspected something amiss and rushed to the farm.
By that time, the six-year-old boy had drowned while the girl, aged four, was clinging onto a pole in the well.
The villagers saved the girl.
Police are on the lookout for Sundarajan, who has gone into hiding.
