Federal agents in Florida said a man suspected of downloading hundreds of child pornographic files used a two-handed samurai sword to stab his computer.
The U.S. Attorney's Office said federal agents obtained a search warrant for the home of Kamil Mezalka, 21, and agents carrying out the search of his Palm Coast home Tuesday saw him use the sword to stab his computer through the console, The Daytona Beach (Fla.) News-Journal reported Thursday.
FBI agents said they were able to recover hundreds of images depicting child porn from Mezalka's damaged computer. They said Mezalka admitted to being attracted to teenage girls and said he "might have" downloaded pornography featuring girls under the age of 13.
Mezalka faces a federal charge of downloading child pornography over the Internet, which carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum of 20 years.
