The Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan highlighted the importance for countries, even those without current plans to develop nuclear energy, to collaborate and respond to a nuclear emergency, said Minister of State for Home and Foreign Affairs Masagos Zulkifli.
He was speaking yesterday at the opening of the inaugural three-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Seminar on Nuclear Safety held at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel Singapore. It was attended by about 140 local and foreign delegates.
The seminar is focused on the theme of "National, Regional and International Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response" and acts as a platform to involve countries both with and without nuclear plants.
Several topics of discussion that will be brought up include potential accident scenarios, emergency-response teams and public-communication plans.
Mr Masagos said that it is a "sovereign decision" for nuclear energy to be included in the energy mix of countries and that some have reconsidered their earlier reliance on nuclear energy after the Fukushima incident last year.
He said: "Some countries have decided to phase out its use, while others have decided to proceed more cautiously.
"Still, nuclear energy is here to stay as there are those who continue to regard it as a viable option."
Singapore has no plans for nuclear energy but is carrying out a feasibility study which will be ready later this year.
He also stressed that it is important for the international community to work closely to demonstrate its commitment to enhance the global nuclear-safety infrastructure.
Countries should acknowledge that any nuclear or radiological incident will probably have trans-boundary effects, he said.
This could include radioactive contamination of the environment and food supply, and long-term risks to public health, he added.
