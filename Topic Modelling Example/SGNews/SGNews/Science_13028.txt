Prolific social network Facebook is currently testing a system which allows users to 'pay to promote' their posts.
The system would allow users to make their posts more visible to their network for a small fee.
Tests are being carried out among New Zealand Facebook users to determine whether the larger Facebook community would be keen to pay in order to increase the visibility of their updates.
The function, known as 'Highlight', could be a possible way for the social networking giant to earn money from its 900 million users.
