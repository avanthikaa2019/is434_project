SINGAPORE - Banks are fitting shields on ATMs here in an effort to beef up their measures against ATM card scammers.
The shields cost about $250 each and are installed on each side of the keypad, The Straits Times reported.
They prevent identification numbers (PINs) from being easily copied, as the one-way translucent shields allow the keypad to be visible only from a specific angle.
DBS and OCBC Bank are in the process of installing the shields on their ATMs. DBS expects the shields to be installed on all their more than 1,100 machines around the island by the end of this month.
Citibank said all of its 220 ATMs have been equipped with the shields, and is in the process of installing the shields on its cash deposit machines.
UOB said it is still testing the use of the keypad shields at selected ATMs across the island.
The move is the latest security initiative undertaken by banks in the wake of a major skimming effort that saw nearly $1 million stolen from DBS customers.
Last year, three of their ATMs were compromised, leading to more than 700 DBS and POSB customers being affected when their account information and passwords were copied.
The shields are widely used in Indonesia, and are seeing increasing take-up rates in countries such as Europe, Hong Kong and mainland China.
However, the shields are not full-proof, as while it makes it more difficult for fraudsters to install pinhole cameras, the keying in of PINs can still be seen from certain vulnerable angles.
Banks here have been progressively adopting various security measures, including sending SMS alerts for transactions above a certain threshold and disallowing the use of ATM cards overseas unless instructed otherwise by customers.
By the end of this year, all banks will be required by the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) to issue new online banking security tokens with enhanced features, and by end-2014, all ATM cards are to have secure smart chips installed.
