MANILA - The Philippines' civil aviation authority said Tuesday it would divert flights to and from Japan and South Korea to coincide with a planned North Korean rocket launch over fears of falling debris.
Flight paths from Japan and South Korea to Manila airport will be closed on April 12-16, when Pyongyang is expected to fire the rocket into orbit, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines spokeswoman Joy Songsong said.
"We have issued a NOTAM (notice to airmen) about the airways which we think would be possibly affected by debris in relation to the launch," she told AFP.
"While flight paths will be closing, we have provided alternate routes or other points of entry."
Airlines concerned have been advised about the planned Philippine action, she said, adding she could not say how many flights would be affected.
The United States and its allies fear the rocket launch is a disguised ballistic missile test.
