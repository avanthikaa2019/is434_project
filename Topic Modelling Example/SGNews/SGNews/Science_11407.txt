The Government plans to award $1.2 billion worth of technology tenders this year, up from $1.12 billion last year.
The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) said in a media release on Thursday that the Government's "continual infocomm investment" in the public sector will help to "enhance operational efficiency and productivity within the public sector" and improve public service delivery to citizens and businesses.
"For the infocomm industry, this presents business opportunities to provide innovative solutions and services to the public sector," the IDA said, as it announced a slew of technology projects.
