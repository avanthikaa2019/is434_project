Jakarta gubernatorial candidate from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), Hidayat Nur Wahid, has guaranteed that his financial records during the election bid are 'clean'. He boasted that none of his financial support come from illegal activities.
"Not a single cent of our campaign funds come from money laundering or corruption. Our [campaign] funds are halal thoyiban or clean," Hidayat said as quoted by kompas.com.
Hidayat, whose running mate is National Mandate Party (PAN)economist Didik J Rachbini, said his campaign's donators were mainly PKS members and supporters.
"We have relied on ourselves in gathering the campaign funds. You will find out later how small our campaign fund is," he said.
The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) had reported last month that incumbent Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was backed by the ruling Democratic Party, had been listed as the richest candidate by securing Rp 46.9 billion (S$6.4 million) plus US$200,000(S$252,000) in in the form of jewelry, cash, land, buildings and other assets.
Following Fauzi are Surakarta Mayor Joko Widodo from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) with Rp 18.4 billion and US$9,483 ; South Sumatra Governor Alex Noerdin (Golkar Party) with Rp 10.5 billion; Hidayat with Rp 6.3 billion and US$10,706; and Maj. Gen. (ret.)
Hendardji Soepandji (independent) with Rp 5.03 billion and $114,250.
The KPK, however, is still verifying the financial report submitted by economist Faisal Basri, another independent candidate.
