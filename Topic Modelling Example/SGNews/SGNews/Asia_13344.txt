Police investigating an incident in which three workers fell to their deaths from Bangkok's Baiyoke Tower 2 on Monday have made an initial determination that the floor of the cradle in which they were suspended collapsed, and that the accident was not caused by a snapped wire.
Two other workers were injured in the incident.
Investigators were waiting for the result of a probe by the Scientific Crime Detection Division into whether the cradle had been previously broken, before determining if the incident was the result of recklessness, city police chief Pol Maj-General Anuchai Lekbumrung said yesterday.
Police would interview the owner of Q Advertising, the victims' employer, later yesterday, as well as the two injured workers, he added.
