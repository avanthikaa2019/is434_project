LOS ANGELES - Astronauts aboard the International Space Station will soon get a special screening of "The Avengers," the blockbuster movie about superheroes defending Earth from aliens.
Disney-owned Marvel Studios said Thursday that a copy of the film will be given to NASA's Mission Control, which will uplink it to the space station, currently orbiting 220 miles (350 kilometers) above Earth.
Dan Cook, psychological support coordinator at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, said that the movie would be good for morale.
"These are the types of things that help to keep the crew connected to home, which is a huge morale boost while being away for long periods of time," he said.
"The studio is privileged" to share the movie "with those up in space exploring the universe," said Louis D'Esposito, Marvel Studios' co-president and the film's executive producer.
"A special thanks goes to NASA for utilizing their incredible technology to make this special screening miles above us in space happen. It is a screening that would make Tony Stark envious."
Stark is the billionaire playboy in the movie who dons his armor and becomes Iron Man.
The movie also features comic book heroes Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, the Black Widow and Hawkeye.
