A 23-year-old man who was found guilty of molesting and sexually violating his 17-year-old date has been sentenced to three years and six months in jail.
Choo Cher Hou committed the offence at a block in Yishun Central on April 24 last year.
According to the Straits Times (ST), he had asked the girl to meet him at McDonald's at Northpoint Shopping Centre at midnight.
When she refused his request to talk elsewhere, he walked away with her handbag.
She called the police and shouted at him.
She saw Choo again at a block of flats in Yishun Central 1. He asked who she was on the phone with before snatching it from her.
When the girl tried to follow him, he pushed her to the floor and pulled down her shorts.
Although she struggled and shouted, Choo bit on her hip and committed the offence of sexual penetration.
When she asked for her phone back, he threw it on the floor and caused it to break apart.
