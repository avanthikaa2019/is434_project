PORTLAND - A huge floating dock cast adrift by Japan's killer tsunami has washed up on an Oregon beach, believed to be the biggest piece of flotsam to make landfall on the United States West Coast so far.
The 20m-long rectangular structure, made of concrete and metal, was spotted floating off the coast on Monday, and then washed in with the high tide on Agate Beach, 160km south-west of Portland.
The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department contacted Japanese diplomats, who confirmed that it was from the March 11 tsunami last year, and had drifted 8,850km across the Pacific over the last 15 months.
Signs of the dock's origins came in the form of Japanese markings and writing on various parts of the seaweed-covered structure, including "Shibata, Japan" on tyres, apparently designed to make it buoyant.
The dock was checked for radioactivity - the killer quake and tsunami triggered a disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant on Japan's east coast - but none was detected.
