Expect to visit culturally themed gardens, see towering tree-like structures, and even enjoy live performances by the likes of American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz once Bay South Garden opens its doors to visitors on June 29.
The Grammy Award winner, as well as home-grown singer Corrine May, will be part of a two-week line-up of programmes to celebrate the opening.
Bay South Garden - spanning 54ha - is the largest of three gardens at Gardens by the Bay, and will be the first to be officially open to the public, it was announced at a media briefing yesterday.
"As the plants...mature over time, we hope that visitors will continue to give their support and grow with the Gardens," said Dr Kiat W. Tan, chief executive of Gardens by the Bay.
Some of Bay South Garden's highlights include 18 tree-like structures called Supertrees - tall, distinctive structures that can already be seen from the highway nearby - which range in height from 25m to 50m.
The Supertrees will showcase a variety of ferns and tropical flowering climbers that will grow along the sides of the structures.
There will also be two conservatories at Bay South Garden - the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome - that will contain plants which grow at temperatures of 23 to 25 deg C.
"It will be excellent that, here in the tropics, we (will) get a touch of the seasons," said Dr Tan.
Entry to Bay South Garden will be free, but entry to the two conservatories will be ticketed.
Non-Singaporeans will be charged $28 for entry to both conservatories, while Singaporeans will be charged $20.
