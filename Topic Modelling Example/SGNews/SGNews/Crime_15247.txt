SINGAPORE - A former security guard was Friday sentenced to two weeks jail for punching a taxi driver in November 2010.
Cabby Tan Choo had collided into Ahmad Bakhtiar Afandi Ismail, 63, at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 1 and Pasir Ris Drive 8. Mr Tan was turning right into Pasir Ris Drive 1 when he hit Ahmad who was riding his motorcycle with his wife as a pillion rider.
As Mr Tan got out of his taxi and was approaching the couple, Ahmad punched him twice. When Tan fell down, Ahmad stamped on his chest.
The Straits Times reported that Tan, who lodged the police report, was treated at Changi General Hospital for chest contusion.
Ahmad could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for voluntarily causing hurt.
