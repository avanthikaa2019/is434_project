A Florida university student who designed a Web site for men to pay women US$5 (S$6.3) to perform "girlfriend-like" tasks said he now has 1,600 users.
Cody Krecicki, 22, a student at Edison State College in Fort Myers, said he was inspired by a girl in his class who was working multiple jobs to stay afloat while attending school and came up with Girlfriendforhire.com, the Naples (Fla.) Daily News reported Monday.
Krecicki said the "girlfriend-like" tasks offered include giving advice, helping to break up with unwanted romantic partners and sending Facebook messages that users can show to their friends.
Krecicki said the services, which also include homework help, each cost $5 and any adult or escort-like services are banned by the Web site's terms of service. He said he personally validates each post before it goes live on the site.
The Web site crashed for several hours due to a high rate of traffic on its first day last month and Krecicki said it has topped 100,000 page views with more than 1,600 registered users who have made 300 orders for the $5 services.
Robin Dunlap, a Texas college student who has sold two "flings" on the site, said it's a great way to make a little extra income.
"I'd be sitting in front of my computer anyway -- that's an extra $5 I'd be getting for what I'm doing anyway," she said.
