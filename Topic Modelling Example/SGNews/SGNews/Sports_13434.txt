Usain Bolt has been dating fashion designer Lubica Slovak for the last six months.
The world's fastest man is said to be "very serious" about the relationship.
But fellow Jamaicans have criticised the 25-year-old for choosing "a white partner", Daily Mail reported.
A friend of 28-year-old Miss Slovak declared: "Love has no race - it's a heart-to-heart connection."
But Jamaicans are unimpressed. An online posting said: "Really now Usain! Some successful black men obviously suffer from a white woman complex. You too?"
Another complained: "Another one of our men snatched."
Miss Slovak, who is reportedly Slovakian-born, emigrated to Canada when she was 14 and studied fashion design at Toronto's Ryerson University.
She moved to Jamaica after she "fell in love" with the island during a holiday in 2000.
She met Bolt last year through a mutual friend, reggae singer Tami Chynn, with whom she owns a boutique and an award-winning clothing line called Anuna.
When a picture of them kissing appeared in a Jamaican newspaper, the couple received a lot of negative publicity, the report said.
A reader said: "I hope when he's ready to settle down he chooses a beautiful Jamaican black woman."
Others called Bolt "the next Tiger Woods", referring to the golfer who was married to Swedish former model Elin Nordegren.
Over the years, Bolt has earned a reputation as a ladies' man and has previously been linked to British waitress Rebeckah Passley and Jamaican reality TV star Taneish "Lava" Simpson.
A friend said: "Usain is a young man at the top of his game and did date a few women, but he has settled down now with Lubica."
