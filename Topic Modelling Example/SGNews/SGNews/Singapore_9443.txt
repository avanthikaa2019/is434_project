Singapore and Malaysia yesterday strengthened their cooperation in fighting drug trafficking, by setting up a joint working committee to tackle the issue.
It is the product of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed yesterday by the two countries' home-affairs ministers.
A first of its kind, the MOU focuses on intelligence sharing, training exchanges, bilateral meetings and joint operations.
It also reaffirms the long history of cross-straits cooperation against drug trafficking, which began in the early 1980s.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, said that drug enforcement will be a springboard for further cross-straits collaborations.
