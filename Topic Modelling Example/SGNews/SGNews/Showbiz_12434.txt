SINGAPORE - Ms Siti Nadiah Sapuan, 19, is a triple threat.
The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Simei student, who is studying sports management, beat 11 other finalists to win the Cleo Runway Search last Saturday.
She also recently won ITE-Carrie's Next Top Model Search 2012 at ITE College East and got into the top 25 of this year's The New Paper New Face.
