Kanye West celebrated the premiere of his new short film Cruel Summer in style.
The 34-year-old American rapper turned- director/writer/producer turned up at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday night with new girlfriend, US reality TV star Kim Kardashian, 31, who led a standing ovation after the film had finished playing.
Also in attendance was rap mogul and West's good pal Jay-Z.
West's speech at the event revealed the deadline squeeze he faced, as his team was still shooting on location in Qatar about a month ago. He said: "All odds were against us having this moment in Cannes."
