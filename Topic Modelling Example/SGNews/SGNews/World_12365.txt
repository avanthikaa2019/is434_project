WASHINGTON - A 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted Bulgaria, striking not far from the capital, Sofia, the US Geological Survey said Monday.
The quake hit at 0033 GMT Tuesday at a depth of 9.1 km (5.7 miles), 24 km (14 miles) west of Sofia, the US monitoring and analysis service said.
The quake comes on the heels of Sunday's 6.0-magnitude earthquake around the northern Italian city of Ferrara that killed six people and reduced homes and historic buildings to rubble.
In August 2009, a 5.0 magnitude earthquake hit the Black Sea between Bulgaria and Romania to the south east of the Kaliakra Cape, the Bulgarian seismological institute said at the time. No serious damage was reported.
