Blame it on the computer hackers.
Malaysian pop star Mizz Nina's public relations officer, Joe Saiful has denied sending e-mails to her friends and media contacts, asking for financial assistance.
"My gmail has been hacked," the celebrity PR cries foul. "Even Nina called me up and asked me why I didn't ask her personally if I need to borrow money."
For those who are in the dark, Mizz Nina is the daughter of billionaire banker, Tan Sri Azman Hashim, who is the AmBank Group Chairman.
In the e-mail dated May 10, a hacker claimed to be Joe and he's in need of 2,400 euros (S$3,901) fast cash 'coz he has been mugged in Spain.
It read: "Help please. It's emergency. I'm presently in Spain for a seminar but I got myself in a fix; I was mugged and I lost my money, bank cards &amp; mobile phone in the course of the attack, but I'm so glad I wasn't hurt. I've immediately contacted my bank for help and to stop my cards. Meanwhile I would like you to lend me some money {2400euros}or any amount you can afford. I'll refund you back upon my arrival back home next weekend."
"It's a hoax," the real Joe confirms. "Please don't believe what you've read."
