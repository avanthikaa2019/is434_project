Member of Parliament Zaqy Mohamad raised concerns about foreign bus drivers after a fatal bus accident in Sengkang last week.
He asked what measures were put in place to ensure foreign bus drivers are qualified and can assimilate well to do their job effectively without compromising the safety of other other road users and pedestrians.
Transport Minister Mr Lui Tuck Yew said that the training of bus drivers must go beyond equipping them with skills for their jobs.
At present, about 61 per cent of bus drivers are locals or Permanent Residents. About 26 per cent are Malaysians and 13 per cent are Chinese nationals.
Mr Lui added that regardless of nationality, it was important to ensure that drivers are adequately trained and given orientation to help them familiarise themselves with the system in Singapore.
He said: "We must not only train the drivers in terms of equipping them with the skills, but preparing them for life in Singapore which may be very different from what they are accustomed to in the past, hence part of the training programme is to make sure we infuse them with the responsibility that they carry when they drive a vehicle like a bus and to make sure that they pay stringent attention to road conditions (and make) sure that they operate their vehicles in a safe manner as possible."
