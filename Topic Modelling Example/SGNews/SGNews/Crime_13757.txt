KOTA KINABALU - A man, who was being nagged by his wife, snapped and stabbed her to death in their home in Sabah's east coast Kinabatangan district.
When he realised what he had done, the Indonesian plantation worker panicked and tried to stab himself with the same knife.
However, the man, 39, survived after he was rushed to a hospital in Lahad Datu, where he is being treated for multiple stab wounds.
In the incident on Wednesday, 41-year-old Intan Bago had been complaining in the kitchen that her husband never helped her with the household chores.
It was the last straw when the wife accused him of being "good for nothing" because he was too lazy to work just as their two-year-old toddler was crying.
Kinabatangan police chief Deputy Supt Martin Lugu said the man picked up a knife before darting into the kitchen and driving it into his wife.
"The wife tried to flee but she collapsed and died at the front door of their house," said DSP Martin.
A security guard in the plantation where the couple's house is located later found the two sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood, he added.
The couple have been married for over 20 years and have six children.
The man was reported to be in stable condition, said DSP Martin, adding that the case was being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.
It took the police four hours to reach the crime scene due to the plantation's remote location.
