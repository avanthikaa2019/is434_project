Community Chest has set a record fund-raising target of $72.3 million this financial year.
It is a big jump from last year's target of $55.7 million. 2010's target was $55.2 million.
The 30 per cent increase is because Community Chest is supporting more programmes this year.
The fund would go towards 82 voluntary welfare organisations (VWO) to provide 219 social service programmes, enabling them to help over 300,000 people.
Community Chest has highlighted key focuses which include persons with disabilities, youths-at-risk and low-income families.
Many plans have been lined up to ensure continuation in social services for persons with disabilities.
Three news centres were set up to provide educational support services for children with special needs. Funding was also channelled to special education schools for adults with disabilities to enhance curriculum and increase enrolment.
Together with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), Community Chest will also co-fund 54 enhanced 'School Social Work to Empower Pupils to Utilise Their Potential' (STEP-UP) programmes. STEP-UP will help support 3,800 youths-at-risk in completing their education.
Three more family service centres are also in the works to widen assistance and outreach to help 600 more families.
28-year-old Masni Bte Miswari is one of the beneficiaries of a VWO funded by Community Chest. Masni, who has an intellectual disability, graduated from both MINDS-Lee Kong Chian Gardens School and SIA-MINDS Employment Development Centre. The former school is a special education school funded by Community Chest.
She started working as a kitchen stewardess at the Holiday Inn Atrium in 2010, and now manages the staff canteen's dishwashing station with two other colleagues with intellectual disabilities.
