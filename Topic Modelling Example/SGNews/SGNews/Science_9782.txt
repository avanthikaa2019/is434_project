Popular Facebook game Dragon Age Legends is now available offline for free, after being taken off the Web recently.
The offline game, which runs on Adobe Air, is a single-player title, which means that players would not be able to invite friends to join in the fun or buy micro-transaction-based items, said games-news website Joystiq.
