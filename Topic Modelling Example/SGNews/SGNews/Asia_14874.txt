YANGON - Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has requested a passport ahead of plans for her first trip outside her homeland in 24 years, but has not yet been granted one, officials said Wednesday.
Suu Kyi, who was elected to parliament in landmark April 1 by-elections seen as a key test of government reforms, began the process of applying for her Myanmar passport before Buddhist New Year celebrations began last week, said an official, who asked not to be named.
"She has not got a passport yet," the official told AFP, adding that the democracy icon planned to visit several countries, without giving further details.
The Norwegian foreign ministry on Wednesday announced that Suu Kyi would travel to Oslo in June as part of her first trip outside Myanmar since 1988.
"After she gets her passport she is hoping to go to at least three countries," another Myanmar official told AFP.
Passport officials visited Suu Kyi's Yangon home last week and took her photograph as part of the application process.
The Nobel laureate, who is expected to take her seat in the lower house of parliament on April 23, is thought to have had any restrictions on her foreign travel lifted with her election.
