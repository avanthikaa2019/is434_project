A six-year-old boy who did not do his homework was buried alive by his father in Yunnan, China, Sin Chew Daily reported.
The father was angry as his son had lied to him when asked whether his teachers had given any homework, it reported.
The 28-year-old punched the boy, who was studying in a kindergarten, several times before hitting his head with a stone.
The boy fainted and his father refused to send him to a hospital.
Later, he buried the boy alive at the mountain behind his house.
Police detained the father after the grandfather of the boy lodged a report three days later.
