A 15-year-old Singaporean prostituted herself after she felt neglected by her feuding parents who did not want custody of her, Guang Ming Daily reported.
The girl, who wanted a pair of branded sport shoes at the time, decided to prostitute herself to buy the shoes instead of asking for money from her parents.
"My parents were fighting among themselves not to get custody of me but to push me away," she said, adding that her parents divorced in 2006.
Feeling rejected, the girl met a 19-year-old prostitute who persuaded the girl to sell herself for money.
The girl was caught by police and was sent to a youth rehabilitation centre, it reported.
The girl's mother, who was a part-time hairstylist and karaoke waitress, said she was shocked when the police told her about her daughter's sex activities.
"I was earning S$1,200 (about RM2,600) a month then, so I worried that I could not take care of her. I wanted her to follow her father so that she could have a better life.
"But her father decided to remarry and was not willing to bear the responsibility," the mother said.
