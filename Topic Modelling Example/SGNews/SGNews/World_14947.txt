MOSCOW - Russia should achieve a deficit-free budget by 2015, and should also not allow total government debt to exceed 15 per cent of gross domestic product during the same period, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday.
"By 2015 we need finally and firmly to achieve a deficit-free budget," Putin told an annual meeting of Finance Ministry officials.
Under its three-year fiscal plan, Russia forecasts a federal budget deficit this year of 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, rising to 1.6 per cent in 2013 and falling to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2014.
Putin's comments provided support for the Finance Ministry as it seeks to keep a tight control over government finances.
The Economy Ministry, which supports higher government spending on infrastructure and human capital, has recently argued that Russia should run a long-term budget deficit to promote investment-led growth.
