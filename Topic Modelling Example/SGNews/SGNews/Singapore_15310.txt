An NTUC FairPrice outlet in Bukit Merah made a spelling boo-boo on a sign, and instead of "coconut" it ended up with an offensive four-letter word which refers to a part of the female anatomy.
The sign was quickly corrected, but not before it went viral online.
"We would like to thank our customers and friends for alerting us to the typographical error on the promotional sign of a coconut drink at our Bukit Merah Central supermarket on Sunday," a FairPrice spokesman said.
"We are very sorry for the oversight by our staff and seek your kind understanding that any offence was unintended."
