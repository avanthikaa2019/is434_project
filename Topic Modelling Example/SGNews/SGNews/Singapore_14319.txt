Some 500 Singapore books - such as children's fiction, lifestyle books and investment titles - will be converted into e-books to be distributed across China from the end of next year.
The agreement to digitise the books, all of which are published here, was signed yesterday between four Singapore publishers - Pan Asia Publishing, People Trends, Experiences &amp; Experiments and EonBoo Publishing - and a Chinese publisher.
The signing took place during the two-day China- Singapore Publishing Symposium in Beijing, which ends today.
The titles were selected to meet the needs of young Chinese families and to cater to the increasing urban population in China.
Among them are two children's books by television actor Edmund Chen and popular children's author, Adeline Foo.
Apart from converting Foo's book, The Diary Of Amos Lee, into an e-book, the title will be licensed to a Beijing publishing firm for translation and adaptation for mainland Chinese readers and will distributed in major cities in China from next year.
Speaking to my paper over the phone from Beijing, where both authors are attending the conference, the duo expressed excitement over the digitisation of their books, saying that it would open up more opportunities for home-grown writers.
Chen said that mainland Chinese can find similarities between the culture in China and that in Singapore. "So, the stories in the (Singapore) books... will resonate among the Chinese population there."
