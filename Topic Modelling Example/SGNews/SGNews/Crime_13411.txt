Berita Harian reported that the police managed to rescue five foreign women from the flesh trade during a raid at a budget hotel in Bandar Sri Damansara recently.
The women, who were from Vietnam, China and Thailand, were holed up in a private room in the hotel, which could only be accessed via an elevator to the first and second levels of the building.
The premises also had an elaborate CCTV system to monitor the presence of authorities.
Deputy Supt Nor Omar Sappi, who heads the Bukit Aman Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, said the victims, aged between 21 and 39, were brought into the country on social visit passes and forced to provide sex services.
They had never left the hotel since the first day they arrived in the country.
A local couple in their 40s were detained under the Anti-Human Trafficking Act 2007 along with several clients at the hotel's health centre.
