A 19-year-old man has been nabbed in an apparent online extortion case where the alleged male victim allegedly stripped for him.
Yesterday, the police said in a press statement that on Feb 19, a 17-year-old boy reported to police that someone whom he had befriended online had extorted money from him.
Preliminary investigations revealed that in January, the victim had befriended the suspect, who posed as a girl on a popular social networking website.
The victim was persuaded to pose naked on his webcam.
Unknown to him, the suspect filmed him.
He then demanded the victim transfer $500 to him and threatened to circulate the footage online if he refused to do so.
Officers from Bedok Police Division and the Criminal Investigation Department tracked down the suspect and he was arrested on Tuesday.
Anyone convicted of extortion can be jailed between two and seven years and caned.
The police remind the public to be careful when interacting with strangers online.
They advise people:
To be wary of messages from strangers who want to befriend you;
When interacting with other Internet users, do not accede to requests that may put you in a vulnerable position, such as performing compromising acts on your webcam;
To inform the police immediately if anyone tries to extort money from you.
