A full-time national serviceman who engaged in loansharking activities was jailed for 18 months and ordered to be given six strokes of the cane.
21-year-old Jerryl Tuen Wai Ki pleaded guilty Wednesday to setting fire and scribbling graffiti on two units at Bedok Reservoir Road and Bedok South Avenue 2 on Dec 30, 2011.
He got involved with a loanshark named Henry after he told a man he met at a Clarke Quay club of his money woes, reported The Straits Times (ST). The man subsequently gave him Henry's number.
When Tuen called Henry, the latter told him he would give Tuen $500 each time he harasses a debtor. This includes acts like setting a door on fire or scribbling O$P$ on the wall.
After receiving the addresses from Henry through SMS, Tuen proceeded with the harassment - roping in his 23-year-old sister as the lookout and his 17-year-old step-brother to flag a taxi for Tuen. He used lighter fluid on the doors and scribbled graffiti on the staircase landings, reported ST.
He was paid $500 for his efforts.
His sister and step-brother were both granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, after being given conditional warning for 12 months.
