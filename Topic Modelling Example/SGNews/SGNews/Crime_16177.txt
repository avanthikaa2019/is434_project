TOYAMA, Japan - A taxi driver has died after being stabbed in the neck in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, and police are investigating whether a man arrested on suspicion of threatening another taxi driver nearby with a knife was involved.
According to the police, Yasuhiro Tanimichi was found slumped on the ground on National Highway Route 156 at about 5pm Saturday.
Tanimichi, 58, was taken to a hospital, but was pronounced dead.
Later that evening, police arrested Seiichi Imai on suspicion of brandishing a knife at another taxi driver in the city while her vehicle was waiting at a traffic light at about 5.30pm Imai, 67, then got out of the vehicle without paying, but was apprehended nearby by police officers.
A small knife with what appeared to be traces of blood was found in the vehicle.
Imai, who has no fixed address, reportedly told police he was not involved in Tanimichi's death. He also denied threatening the female taxi driver.
The taxi company Tanimichi works for had dispatched him to a restaurant in Takaoka at about 4.50pm after receiving a request for a taxi.
The taxi driver called the company soon after on his cell phone to say he had been attacked.
