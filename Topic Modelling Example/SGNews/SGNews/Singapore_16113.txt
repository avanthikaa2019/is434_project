The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has set up a new framework to streamline the intelligence-gathering capabilities of its three services: the army, air force and navy.
The Command, Control, Communications, Compu- ters and Intelligence (C4I) community - inaugurated yesterday by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen - aims to use personnel from all SAF intelligence units more effectively, to facilitate local and overseas operations.
The units used to exist separately in their own services, with only the army having four dedicated C4I battalions.
By bringing them together, the new community will aim to deliver information to the fighting forces faster, enabling them to make the right decisions at the right time during critical phases of operations.
The head of the new set-up, Rear-Admiral Joseph Leong, took his oath of command at Pasir Laba Camp yesterday.
The C4I community will be responsible for train- ing and building on existing intelligence-gathering capabilities in the three services.
Dr Ng said: "With combined inputs, the SAF is able to see first and more. It also has the capability to strike the enemy with a variety of options."
This would bring about a more "potent SAF that is more flexible, adaptable and more responsive to the demands of the modern battlefield", he said.
