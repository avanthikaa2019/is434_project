A Singapore Airlines (SIA) employee, Leonard Louis Boyd, was charged on Thursday for assisting an unlicensed moneylender in his business.
On June 30 last year, the 43-year-old SIA cabin crew member had allegedly handed over his personal identification number along with his POSB ATM card to an individual named Ben Ho for use in his illegal busness.
Boyd has been released on $15,000 bail.
A pre-trial conference has been scheduled for June 21.
If convicted, Boyd can be fined between $30,000 and $300,000 and jailed for up to four years.
