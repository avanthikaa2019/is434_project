KUALA LUMPUR - Police have identified the suspects involved in the incident where a real estate agent was stripped naked and tied up before being robbed by her "prospective clients" last Friday.
The two suspects were identified through a closed-circuit TV footage at the condominium when she went to meet the prospective "clients".
Police sources revealed the suspects are not husband and wife as what they told the 34-year-old victim.
Police believe a syndicate is behind the incident.
The victim was stripped naked and tied up when she met with the suspects at an empty condominium unit in Mont Kiara.
The two suspects then escaped with the victim's Toyota Vios, her mobile phone, laptop and RM200 (S$89).
The victim also had bruises on her face and ears.
