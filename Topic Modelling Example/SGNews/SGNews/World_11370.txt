BEIRUT - Syria's President Bashar al-Assad said on Sunday authorities would maintain a crackdown against the armed opposition but were still ready for dialogue with political opponents.
"We will continue firmly confronting terrorism, leaving the door open for those who want to return," Assad told parliament.
