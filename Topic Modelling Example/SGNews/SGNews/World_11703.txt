UNITED NATIONS - Sudanese troops on Tuesday withdrew from the disputed territory of Abyei, a UN spokesman told AFP.
Rival South Sudan had already pulled its security forces out of the territory after the UN Security Council had demanded both sides get their forces out of Abyei.
"The UN peacekeeping mission in Abyei, UNISFA, has confirmed that the withdrawal of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) from the Abyei area was completed today late in the evening," said UN peacekeeping spokesman Kieran Dwyer.
Abyei is one of the key disputes between Sudan and South Sudan, which have been fighting each other along their uncharted border.
Sudanese Media Center, which is close to the Khartoum government, reported earlier that Sudan's forces had withdrawn from Abyei which they had overrun in May last year.
"They gave the military compound there to UN peacekeepers," said SMC. Diplomatic sources said the pullout involved about 300 troops.
