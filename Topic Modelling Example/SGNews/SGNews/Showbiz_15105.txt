800 party goers attended the PUMA FAAS Beats Final Showdown on Saturday and watched 18-year-old Natalie Koh walk away with an autographed T-shirt by Olympian and Puma ambassador Usain Bolt, $1000 worth of PUMA vouchers and a PUMA FAAS watch after she won the final.
Koh scored a high score of 12,527 points. She said it was nerve-wrecking to watch the other contenders play the game initially.
"I knew I had to keep a cool mind in order to excel.
"I just told myself to give it the best shot and just minutes later, I was crowned the winner! I am really happy," she said.
The online musical rhythm-based game was created by PUMA to launch the new range of the Spring/Summer 2012 FAAS shoes collection.
Held at Zouk, the festival opened with a dance performance by the PUMA FAAS Dance crew and songs by local singer Nathan Harton, who was appointed as the Opinion Leader (Music) to first introduce the PUMA FAAS Beats game in Singapore when the campaign was launched in February.
Party goers also made use of different game stations located at parts of Zouk.
They played speed-related activities like the Puma Speed Trap, where participants tried beating the best timing clocked for a 30m dash and social games like the Toy catcher machines.
There were also Kinect games, where celebrities Ian Fang and Adeline Lim also joined in the fun.
"The massive turnout at this year's FAAS campaign is amazing. We are extremely pleased to be holding an event that resonates with the public, especially the youths, and we will continue to bring about better experiences to our consumers", said Ms Sheryl Wong, General Manager, PUMA Singapore.
There was also a PUMA's Spring/Summer 2012 FAAS collection fashion show.
Supermodel Sheila Sim and other local celebrities such as Romeo Tan, Yuan Shuai, Zhang Zhen Huan, Rebecca Tan and Pamelyn Chee graced the runway to show off PUMA's new offerings.
