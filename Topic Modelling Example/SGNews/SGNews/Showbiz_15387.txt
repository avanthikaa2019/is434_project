KUALA LUMPUR - Fresh from being voted the most popular actress on TV by readers of Berita Harian, Fasha Sandha announced she would be ending her days as a single woman by marrying businessman Toh Muda Rizal Ashram Ramli later this month.
However, the wedding would be a closed affair with about 300 family members, relatives and friends attending, Fasha, 28, told Harian Metro on Tuesday.
The event, it is understood, would be held at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur on April 27.
Word of the award-winning actress getting married first leaked out early last month when she and Rizal were spotted at a marriage course.
Fasha, who had just completed shooting the drama Seindah Sakura in Paris, had remained tight-lipped then.
Rizal, 36, said they had prepared for the wedding in stages as both of them were working on tight schedules.
