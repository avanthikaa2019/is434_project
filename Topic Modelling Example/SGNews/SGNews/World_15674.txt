KABUL - Afghanistan and the US have struck a deal on special forces operations in the insurgency-wracked country, Kabul said Sunday, with night raids - a controversial issue - to be led by Afghans.
Kabul's foreign ministry invited journalists to a signing ceremony for the agreement later Sunday, and President Hamid Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi told AFP: "After the signing of this document all night raids become Afghan-led."
"The foreign forces, the US forces, will have a supporting role in the night raids, for instance intelligence sharing."
Night raids by special forces against insurgent hideouts have triggered popular anger and long been a source of friction with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has denounced the NATO operations as reckless.
But Western military commanders stress that they are extremely useful in the war against Taliban insurgents, who have been fighting Karzai and his Western allies for more than a decade.
"There will be a joint body comprising Afghan and US/NATO forces," said Faizi. "When there's need for a night raid this body will decide and the final decision will be made by Afghans.
"When Afghans approve the operation, the operation will be executed and Afghans will determine whether there is a need for the foreigners to take part. "If there's a need, the foreigners will provide a supporting role like air support or other modern technology."
A warrant would also have to be issued by Afghan legal authorities, he said. The agreement is to be signed later Sunday by Afghanistan's defence minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and General John Allen, the US commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
A spokesman for the US embassy declined to confirm a deal had been agreed, but said: "If the foreign ministry has invited you to a ceremony I'm sure there will be one."
