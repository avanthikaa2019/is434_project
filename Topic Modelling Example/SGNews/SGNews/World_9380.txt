GENEVA - Syria on Wednesday stormed out of a UN debate on a freshly critical report on the rights abuses in the conflict-torn country.
&ldquo;We will not participate in this flagrantly political meeting,&rdquo; said Syrian ambassador Faisal Khabbaz Hamoui (above), before leaving the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
The diplomat denounced a &ldquo;war of disinformation against Syria&rdquo; and condemned &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; operating there who he said were supported and financed from abroad.
He walked out shortly after the chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria presented the latest report on the deteriorating situation there, citing increasing sectarian killings and the role of pro-government militia in the Houla massacre in May.
