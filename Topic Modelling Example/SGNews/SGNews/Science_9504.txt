National servicemen, NSmen and those working in places where security is important have few choices when it comes to looking for a phone with no camera function.
It means getting a really basic phone without a camera function - which is hard to find these days - or stripping the camera from a phone and putting it back, when your national-service stint is over, for instance.
BlackBerry has come to the rescue with its camera-less Curve 9360 smartphone. It runs on the BlackBerry 7 operating system and enables users to connect to the Web, play games and use BlackBerry Messaging.
All the usual smartphone functions are present, except for the camera.
There is also a version of the 9360 with a camera function.
Ironically, the camera-less Black- Berry 9360 costs more than the 9360 with a camera function.
Mobile Square at Far East Plaza in Scotts Road sells the camera- less 9360 at $435, while the 9360 with a camera function costs $385.
The devices are also available from telcos, but prices would be significantly higher.
