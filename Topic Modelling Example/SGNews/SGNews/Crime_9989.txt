At a members-only club in Robertson Quay one November evening in 2010, a Briton pointed out to a Singaporean that there was a dry-cleaning tag still attached to his coat.
This casual remark made at the Filter Club in Gallery Hotel was to later fuel an angry encounter between the two.
A while later, as project manager Richard Jonathan Mills, 29, was waiting in line to use the toilet at the club, Alexander Lincoln Chew Yew Wah, 27, jumped the queue and, in so doing, bumped into Mr Mills, triggering a dispute.
The Briton was heard passing what District Judge Ronald Gwee said during the hearing were derogatory remarks. Mr Mills had also egged Chew to hit him. Chew did so, landing punches until Mr Mills fell.
The police were called in. In a district court yesterday, Chew, who had pleaded guilty, was fined $4,000 for causing hurt to Mr Mills that Nov 28 evening.
The Briton was in hospital for two days. He had cuts near his right eye and a computed-tomography scan of his head showed tissue damage.
Chew, a 2009 business graduate of the Singapore Management University, runs his own firm importing sports supplements.
The former national rugby player could have been fined up to $5,000, or jailed up to two years, or both fined and jailed.
