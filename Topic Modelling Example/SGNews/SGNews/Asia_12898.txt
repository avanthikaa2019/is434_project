THAILAND - Housemaids and crew members of fishing trawlers will have their working conditions improved if an amendment to a labour regulation bill - approved in principle by the Cabinet yesterday - is passed on.
According to many altered conditions in the bill, those working as domestic maids are entitled to a weekly one day break, and have the choice of enjoying all national holidays or being paid for them.
They will also be granted paid sick leave, and have paid vacations.
The bill stipulates no person under 15 can be hired as a domestic.
Strict working conditions enforced on Thai and immigrant crew members working on fishing trawlers are also relaxed on trawlers with fewer than 20 crew members or on trawlers which travel off Thai waters for more than a year in each trip.
Full details of these conditions have yet to be released.
