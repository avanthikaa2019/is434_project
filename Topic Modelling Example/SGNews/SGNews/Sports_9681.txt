SINGAPORE - Singapore's only hope in the Li-Ning Singapore Open, Xing Aiying, has crashed out of the tournament during the semi-final match against Taipei's world No. 13, Cheng Shao-chieh.
Xing, 22, ranked 49th in the world, lost the game 21-3 and 7-21.
She is the first woman shuttler to make this stage of a Super Series event, reported The Straits Times.
Fellow Singapore shuttler Gu Juan made the quarter-finals of the All-England Championships last year.
