SINGAPORE - This year's National School Games is set to be telecast on Starhub's TV channel, SuperSports Arena, and online.
In an attempt to enhance the exposure of this year's sports competitions, the Ministry of Education (MOE), together with AzVOX Media and Communications, will broadcast them with a focus on the A' and B' division events.
This includes games at the upper secondary and Junior College levels.
Airing at 9pm every Wednesday from today onwards, the coverage will include 13 episodes of a half-hour weekly show and a bumper one hour round-up show to be broadcast at the end of the season.
The shows will also be available on the VOXSPORTS website and SSC's video portal the following Monday after the programme's telecast.
Enthusiasts can also look forward to video-clip highlights on VOXSPORTS.
