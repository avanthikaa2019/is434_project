SUNGAI PETANI - Police have arrested two men in connection with the murder of a 23-year-old beauty salon owner whose body was found in a ditch on Wednesday morning.
Both men, in their 20s, were believed to be known to the victim, M. Revathi, of Taman Arked here.
It was learnt that the two were picked up from their homes hours after the body was found.
Kuala Muda district police chief Assistant Commissioner Hashim Ali confirmed the arrests.
He also said police had obtained a seven-day remand order against both suspects.
Hashim said the post-mortem revealed that Revathi died from a stab wound to the abdomen. He declined to elaborate further as investigations were still under way.
Revathi was found dead in a metre-deep ditch in Jalan Amanjaya, about 200m away from the Sungai Petani court complex, near here, at about 7am.
Her body was found slumped on her motorcycle, about five hours after her family lodged a missing person's report.
The victim's handphone, gold ring and necklace were missing.
Her father, M. Marimuthoo, 58, felt something amiss after his daughter, who is the third among four siblings, failed to return home on Tuesday night.
She also did not answer her phone calls.
The victim's uncle, N. Subrayam, 53, said the family was shocked and sad over Revathi's death.
He described his niece as hardworking and a great daughter to her family.
"She worked hard not only to pursue her dreams but also to make her family proud of her achievement," said Subrayam, who is the Kedah People's Progressive Party secretary.
