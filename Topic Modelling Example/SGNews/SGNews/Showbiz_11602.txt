JAKARTA - A video of American pop act Lady Gaga inviting her fans in Singapore to give a shout out to Indonesian fans during her performance in the country on Tuesday evening has been circulating on the video-sharing website Youtube.
In the four-minute video, the 26-year-old singer, wearing black clothes, asks the Singapore audience to shout: "You were born this way, Indonesia!" twice while holding a mini placard saying "we love Indo".
"I just want you to do something special for me, okay? I can't go to Indonesia this year. We all know why. So, to make Indonesian "Little Monsters" happy &hellip; put your paws up in the name of compassion," she said in the video, uploaded by Youtube user 123teevee on Tuesday.
"Little Monsters" is the nickname for the singer's group of followers.
Gaga, who has expressed her devastation over the cancellation of her Jakarta concert via her Twitter account, @ladygaga, asked the Singapore audience "to put your paws up" for Indonesia, quoting a phrase from her self-embracing anthem "Born This Way".
"One more time so that everyone in Indonesia can hear you &hellip; one, two, three &hellip; You were born this way, Indonesia! Thank you for doing that for me, for them and for each other. In the end, it's the music that bonds all of us," she added.
The Grammy-award winning singer was performing in Singapore as a part of her 2012 world tour, titled "Born This Way Ball" late on Tuesday.
Her Jakarta gig, previously scheduled for June 3, was cancelled amid pressure from the country's hard-liner groups.
Among Indonesian fans who came to Singapore to watch Gaga was local presenter Becky Tumewu, who said via her Twitter on Tuesday evening that "Gaga is dedicating the Singapore concert to a group of Little Monsters in Indonesia".
The singer, known for her songs such as "Bad Romance" and "Just Dance" is slated to perform again in Singapore on Thursday.
