NEW YORK - United States (US) pop star Katy Perry will become the latest celebrity to be depicted in the biography comic book Fame series, publisher Bluewater Productions said on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old's life shown in Fame: Katy Perry has her moving from a Californian churchgoing upbringing under her Christian parents to bouncing around several music labels in Los Angeles until striking a deal that landed her first big hits, I Kissed A Girl, and Hot n Cold.
Perry, who has delved into colourful, fantasy-filled recreations of herself in music videos not unlike a comic book character, will also be the subject of a 3-D concert documentary due for release next month.
Her marriage to actor and comedian Russell Brand ended late last year.
