LOS ANGELES - One of the two male masseurs who accused actor John Travolta of sexual assault dropped his US$2-million (S$2.5-million) lawsuit on Tuesday, but the lawyer for the second man said that he was going ahead with the case and was confident of success.
The unidentified man - referred to as John Doe No. 1 - who claimed that the Hollywood star groped him during a massage session in Beverly Hills in January, filed a notice dismissing his lawsuit with the federal court in Los Angeles.
Travolta's lawyer, Mr Marty Singer, who has termed the claims "absurd and ridiculous", said on Tuesday that the actor was vindicated by the dismissal of the first complaint.
"My client is completely vindicated by Doe No. 1 dropping his claims and dismissing his lawsuit. We fully expect that my client will similarly be vindicated with respect to Doe No. 2, as well as with respect to any other person who makes meritless claims against John Tra- volta," Mr Singer said in a statement.
The first masseur was reported last week to have said that he got the date of the alleged incident wrong, after photos and restaurant receipts surfaced, putting the Satur- day Night Fever actor in New York on the same day.
