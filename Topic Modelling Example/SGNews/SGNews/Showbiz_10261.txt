tabla! spoke to some members of the audiences that filled the Esplanade Theatre for the Taj Express shows. This is what some of them had to say:
"Just one word... excellent. The music, the dance and the energy was fantastic. Everything blends so well. The energy level was up there. I am very amazed by it." - Ms Wan Wahidah, who watched the musical on June 6
"The guy (Pulkit Samrat) danced very well. Normally we don't see such dances on a live stage." - Mr Sushil Parashar (top image) who watched the musical on June 8
"I had great expectations because I saw the Merchants Of Bollywood. It was colourful and vibrant. I would see it again for the dances and the colour. It was a great effort by Vaibhavi (Merchant)." - Ms Renu Siva, who watched the musical on June 7
"The hero was my favourite. He danced really well and reminded me of Ranbir Kapoor. Two hours passed so quickly. We had a great time." - Ms Nasreen Mehdi, who watched the musical on June 8 with her friends
"Outstanding effort. This is like a Bollywood movie unfolding live on stage. Outstanding energy by the performers and to have to deliver the lines after performing 10 to 12 songs, they pulled it off remarkably well." - Indian film director Abhinav Kashyap who directed the 2010 hit film Dabangg. He ditched the IIFA Rocks event to watch the musical on June 8
