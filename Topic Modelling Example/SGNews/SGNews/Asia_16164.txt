PHNOM PENH - Myanmar's foreign minister told his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Monday that his country's historic by-elections had gone "smoothly", diplomats said.
Myanmar's Wunna Maung Lwin said the vote "has gone rather smoothly, orderly and the participation has been very high," ASEAN chief Surin Pitsuwan said after a meeting of the 10-member block's foreign ministers in Phnom Penh.
The milestone polls on Sunday appeared to give opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi - whose landslide general election victory in 1990 was never recognised by the then-ruling junta - her first seat in parliament.
Wunna Maung Lwin also told the assembled ministers that he hoped the elections would "contribute to a more effective integration of Myanmar into the global community," Surin said.
ASEAN observers were "very encouraged by the orderly manner of this important democratic exercise" in which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) claimed 43 of the 44 seats up for grabs, Surin added.
But asked whether ASEAN observers had reported that the polls were free and fair, Surin said: "We have to wait. They need to have some time to go through that. The (ASEAN) chair will have some statement."
Cambodia, which is hosting a two-day summit of ASEAN leaders this week, is the current ASEAN chair.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa welcomed the by-elections as "an opportunity for Myanmar to make the reform process even more irreversible".
Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario told reporters the elections were a "vindication of the global community that believed that Myanmar could pursue this democratisation track effectively".
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam - a grouping of nearly 600 million people of hugely disparate economic development and political systems.
