In an ambush on March 30, police arrested six men for illegal horse betting activities at a housing estate in Tampines.
Having received a tip off, police officers from the Bedok police division confirmed that illegal horse betting was taking place at the void deck of a block in Tampines.
In a three-hour-long operation, the officers managed to arrest the six suspects and seized illegal horse betting paraphernalia.
These included cloned pagers, pieces of paper with horse betting entries and cash amounting to about $3,000.
Investigations against the suspects are ongoing.
If convicted under the Betting Act for betting or wagering in a public place, the suspects will face a maximum fine of $5,000 or jail for up to six months or both.
Under the same Act, the suspects can be convicted of acting as bookmakers or helping a person in committing an offence under this Act to evade arrest or detection.
If so, they will face a minimum fine of $20,000 and a maximum one of $200,000. They can also be sentenced to a maximum jail term of 5 years.
