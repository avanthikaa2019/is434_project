DAMON Albarn, the lead singer of British band Blur, has hinted that after a headlining show to celebrate the end of the Olympic Games in Britain in August, the band will not perform again.
He told the Guardian that though the band will be performing a new song at the gig, he doesn't "see any more recordings after this".
