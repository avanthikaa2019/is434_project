The largest cluster of dengue cases has been found at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and Avenue 10.
A local news report said there were 53 dengue cases recorded there.
Five dengue clusters have also been found in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Avenue 8.
Residents are concerned that the problem could worsen due to construction work in the area.
The National Environment Agency (NEA) said its officers have been conducting search and destroy operations in the area daily.
The Aedes mosquito, which carries the dengue virus, breeds in stagnant water found in pots, pails and vases.
NEA says it will act against those responsible for breeding mosquitoes.
