TORONTO- RESEARCH In Motion (RIM) has hired bankers for a far-reaching strategic review and to look for partnerships as the BlackBerry-maker warned that it would likely report a shock fiscal first-quarter operating loss.
The company now finds itself struggling badly in the smartphone market as it trails far behind Apple, and other rivals such as Samsung Electronics that use Google's Android software.
RIM also said it would cut a "significant" number of jobs, although it did not say how many. Two sources with close connections to RIM said it plans to slash its workforce closer to 10,000 by early next year, from 16,500 currently.
RIM hired bankers from JPMorgan Securities and RBC Capital Markets to help the firm evaluate strategies, including a possible overhaul of its business model, as well as other moves, such as expanding the BlackBerry platform through partnerships and licensing deals.
Last year, RIM held numerous takeover discussions with potential buyers, ranging from Amazon and Microsoft to private-equity firms, sources told Reuters. But those talks did not result in any merger-and-acquisition transaction.
