PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - For singer Datuk DJ Dave, it was a no-brainer to pick Dayang Nurfaizah as a duet partner for his upcoming mega concert.
He said he liked her positive attitude and her commitment.
"I have admired Dayang's vocals since I got to know her a few years ago. Her vocals are at par with international singers and she expresses the songs well," he said.
The "Journey Through Song: Ingin Bersua DJ Dave" will be held from June 1 to 3 at Panggung Sari, Istana Budaya.
It is being staged to mark his 40 years in the music industry.
He told mStar Online that Dayang, 31, had star quality, describing her as one of the best in the country.
The 64-year-old also said that Dayang would be his duet partner for the song Segalanya (originally sung with Liza Aziz).
"I have been undergoing vocal training and exercising to maintain my stamina in preparation for the concert. Technical, stage and other preparations are also being planned carefully," he said.
