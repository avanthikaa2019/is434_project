1,590 children have come down with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) for the week that ended April 28, 2012.
It is a record-high as the number of infections diagnosed weekly has stayed above the 780-cases-a-week epidemic level for almost three months, reported The Straits Times.
However, several children awarded at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) were not critically ill.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times that the HFMD strain now circulating in Singapore is a mild one.
Childcare centres that were closed for a mandatory 10 days due to having more than 16 HFMD cases or an attack rate greater than 23 per cent, and a transmission period of more than 24 days, will now reopen on Monday.
They are Ascension Kindercare in Potong Pasir, and Bethel Child Development Centre in Aljunied Crescent.
Brighton Montessori in River Valley Road is now closed till May 10, 2012.
Parents are advised to check their children for runny nose and fever, blisters on their hands and arms, mouth ulcers, and blisters on soles of feet, legs and/or buttocks before sending them to school.
