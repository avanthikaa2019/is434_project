PARIS - Disgraced ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn voted Sunday in France's presidential election, a race he had been tipped to win before he became embroiled in a string of sex scandals.
The former Socialist party presidential hopeful cast his ballot at a school in Sarcelles, north of Paris. He appeared smiling and relaxed before a large group of waiting photographers but did not make any comment.
Before he was arrested for alleged sexual assault in New York last May, polls said the former boss of the International Monetary Fund was favourite to beat incumbent right-winger President Nicolas Sarkozy in the election.
The case against him collapsed, but it cost him his shot at the Socialist presidential nomination and triggered a series of scandalous revelations.
Since then Strauss-Kahn has been implicated in a prostitution ring probe in northern France, although the 62-year-old has insisted that he was unaware that women at the numerous orgies he took part in were prostitutes.
After Strauss-Kahn's fall from grace, Francois Hollande won the Socialist Party's primary nomination and polls predict he will narrowly beat Sarkozy in Sunday's run-off vote.
