English actress Rosamund Pike introduced me to the British shoe designer Charlotte Olympia Dellal last year.
This week, the latter was in Singapore to launch her eponymous vertiginous footwear, seen mostly on the pampered footsies of celebs like Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, Peaches Geldof, London's It girl set and, of course, Pike.
Imagine my horror spotting her down at her heel in On Pedder in Scotts Square last Thursday.
Rise, Miss Dellal, oh for goodness' sake, it was only Singapore's well-shod shopping set getting the designer to autograph their soles.
They had rushed in, Charlotte Olympia limited stock flew off the shelves (there is a winged design), and the women wanted her signature on the new shoes.
Didya evah? The 32-year-old retro beauty - she has an Iraqi property developer father and Brazilian model mother - is herself mother of two little boys.
"We had our son first, and then married, and had another, the reverse of what my parents did."
She is one of four children and her brother Alex used to date Charlotte Casiraghi, daughter of Princess Caroline, granddaughter of Grace Kelly of Monaco.
So have you customised shoes for the Grimaldi family (the Monagasques)?
With a toss of her Rita Hayworthy blonde waves, she said: "No, no, I haven't."
She confirmed that her brother and the princess are no longer a society item.
Charlotte's web includes famous faces you see at your hairdresser's - between the pages of Hello! and Harper's and Vogue and Vanity Fair and, by next month, Singapore Tatler and Prestige magazines.
Her fabulous and fashionable albeit vertigo-inducing five-inch heels are relatively new, since 2008 and from $1,100.
She draws with a ballpoint on a little "shoe notes" booklet.
"I wish I could do watercolours like Manolo (Blahnik).
"I had a dog once, named Manolo."
Heel, boy. The shoe queen has arrived.
