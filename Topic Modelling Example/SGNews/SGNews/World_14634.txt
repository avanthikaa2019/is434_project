MOSCOW - A 49-year old Russian with a big spoon in hand swallowed a pound (500 grams) of caviar in about 90 seconds to win what was billed as the world's first eating contest featuring the pricey fish roe.
&ldquo;In Texas, people organise hot dog and hamburger eating championships and contests,&rdquo; the swanky Apartment restaurant said in a press release for the event.
&ldquo;In Moscow, people eat black caviar instead,&rdquo; it said.
The contestants were drawn from 12 winners of a lottery who were each handed a bowl of caviar lined up on a lacquered table while a man in black tie played lounge music on a white grand piano.
Muscovite Alexander Lavrov did not disclose his profession after swallowing about $5,000 worth of the stuff in a minute and 26 seconds and then raising his arms up to applause.
He was awarded 10,000 rubles ($340) and several more glass jars of the salty delicacy. The Moscow River embankment house said it spent around two million rubles (S$88,000) on the promotional event.
