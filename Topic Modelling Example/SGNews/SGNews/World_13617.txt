US NAVAL BASE AT GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba - Five accused 9/11 plotters, including self-confessed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, appeared before a military court Saturday on charges of planning the deadliest attack on US soil.
&ldquo;Prosecution is ready to proceed in the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,&rdquo; said Chief Prosecutor Brigadier General Mark Martins.
Mohammed, wearing a long beard, was seated along with his four co-plotters. Dressed in white jumpsuits and some in white skullcaps, they were uncuffed, seated at some distance from each other.
If convicted, they face the death penalty for the deaths of each of the 2,976 victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
