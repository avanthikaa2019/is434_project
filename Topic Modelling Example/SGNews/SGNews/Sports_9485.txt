Filipino hotshots Ronnie Alcano, Dennis Orcollo and Lee Vann Corteza posted contrasting victories Sunday in the 2012 World 9-Ball Championship at the Al Sadd Spoorts Club in Doha, Qatar.
Alcano, runner-up in last year's edition, overwhelmed Singaporean Toh Kian Han, 9-3, while Orcollo struggled past UAE's Ali Saeed Alsuwaidi, 9-6. In contrast, Corteza, currently world No. 8, routed Croatia's Ivica Putnik, 9-0.
Joining them in the winners' circle are Antonio Gabica, who routed Croatia's Andrea Kla-sovic (9-4), and unheralded Marlon Caneda, who beat Spain's Francisco Diaz Pizarro, 9-6.

Other winners were Germans Oliver Ortmann, who tripped Britain's Richard Jones (9-6), and Ralf Souquet, who beat Filipino Israel Rota, 9-2.
The Netherland's Nick Van den Berg also moved within a win of reaching the last 64 following a 9-7 conquest of Filipino Joven Alba.
The trio, however, avoided early exit by taking their must-win matches in the event dangling $40,000 to the champion.
Alba bested Portugal's Henrique Correia, 9-4; Rota routed Korean Lee Wan-su, 9-4; Faraon repulsed Britain's Richard Jones, 9-6; and Calasang nipped Taipei's Kuo Yi Che, 9-8.
The Netherland's Huidji See and Niels Feijen, Finland's Mika Immonen, the USA's Shane Van Boening and England's Chris Melling also won handily and avoided elimination.
Filipino pool maestro Efren "Bata" Reyes, Hall of Famer Francisco "Django" Bustamante and world No. 12 Carlo Biado were among the winners Saturday.
Also winning were compatriots Roberto Gomez, Ramil Gallego and Joyme Vicente.
The final 64 will begin tomorrow.
