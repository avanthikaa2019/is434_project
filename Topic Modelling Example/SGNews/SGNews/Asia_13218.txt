The bodies of Sukhoi Superjet 100 plane-crash victims have been found in debris by Search and Rescue (SAR) teams who reached the site Thursday afternoon.
The National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) has yet to reveal the number of bodies recovered in the wreckage of the Russian-made jet or the identities of the victims.
"We have to be careful about the number of victims because we still need to cross-check with the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) and the families of the victims," Basarnas spokesman Gagah Prakoso said Thursday, as quoted by kompas.com.
The aircraft crashed during its second flight as part of a flight demonstration.
It was carrying 45 passengers, including eight Russians.
The wreckage was found this morning near Mt. Salak near Bogor, but the recovery of bodies has been hindered by bad weather.
"I hope the weather is on our side. We're focusing on finding the victims and evacuating them," Gagah said.
The recovery is expected to finish tomorrow morning. Victims will be transported to the police's R. Sukanto Hospital in Kramat Jati, East Jakarta.
