Sporting events firm Trax Global's owners have been hit with a lawsuit by a businessman.
The Straits Times reported Tuesday that Mr Sarvottam Sahgal, managing director of Indian company Jamini Exports, is suing Mr Regunath Ambalam and Mr Hariharan Sundararajan for fraud and negligence, as well as the return of $41,465, plus other losses and damages.
Trax Global had first arrived on the sporting scene promising to change the face of local athletics with a $6.3 million war chest.
It had announced plans to organise an international track and field meet with a prize purse of $1.75 million.
Plans for sporting events, a sponsorship deal and charity donations have also stalled.
Mr Sarvottam Sahgal's lawyer told The Straits Times that a writ of summons was filed on April 2. A police report was also lodged.
Trax Global's general manager Frankie Lee, a former Singapore Athletic Association (SAA) chief of events and marketing, has also resigned two months into the job.
The Straits Times said he left because he was not paid his $5,000 monthly salary. He said the company wasn't what he had expected.
The English daily's checks on Trax Global also found that its plans for high-profile athletics events have not got off the ground.
Its flagship event - the Trax Championships - has not been sanctioned by the SAA. It is due to be held here and in India after the London Olympics.
Without SAA's approval, international athletes will not be allowed to take part in the Singapore event.
The Straits Times also reported that proposed venue Bishan Stadium has not received any bookings from the company.
A proposed US$150,000 title sponsorship deal with the Asian Athletics Association (AAA) to sponsor the three-leg Asian Grand Prix has been cancelled.
A planned $200,000 donation which Trax Global pledged to the Bone Marrow Donor Programme has also not come through, the charity told The Straits Times.
