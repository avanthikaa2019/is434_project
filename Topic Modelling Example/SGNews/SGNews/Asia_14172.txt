An Iranian tourist was attacked by two transvestites on Soi Pattaya 10, Pattaya police said.
Reza Sumieypor told police that one of the "ladyboys" struck him with a high-heeled shoe while the other waited. Police said Patthera Samrongphan confessed to hitting the Iranian tourist on the head after a fight erupted when the victim paid him Bt600 for sex in a nearby hotel, after initially promising Bt1,000.
After Reza had his wound attended to, he told police he didn't want to file charges against the two suspects, but demanded that they pay him Bt4,700 in damages and apologise.
