SINGAPORE - Singaporean businessman Ooi Hoe Seong has personally come out to say that he and Gong Li have been divorced for three years.
According to The Straits Times, he told the Chinese media that the split was a mutual decision and the two are still friends.
"This is true ... Gong Li and I are indeed divorced," he told the reporter over the phone.
He said the couple, who married in 1996, have been apart more often than together, and that the relationship is more of a friendship than a romance.
He added that they never quarrelled, nor were there any disputes during their marriage.
The confirmation follows months of rumours of her being attached to a French cameraman 13 years her junior.
