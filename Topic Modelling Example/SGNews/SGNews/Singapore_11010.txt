For Johann Johari Nazir, 29, it was impossible to ignore the grey-haired elderly man slumped against a wall at Orchard MRT station.
The insurance-claims officer and his wife, Siti Rasyidah, 27, came to the man's aid on May 20, after he tumbled down a flight of stairs near Tangs department store.
Johann's account of the incident is one in a recent series of stories highlighting the good deeds of Singaporeans on Stomp.
In Johann's case, he and his wife called the Singapore Civil Defence Force for assistance, and arranged for an ambulance to take the elderly man to Singapore General Hospital.
There, they learnt that he needed surgery, as his fall had aggravated a previous leg injury.
Judging from recent stories on Stomp, Singaporeans - like Johann and his wife - are more than willing to assist people in need, or to simply extend a gracious hand.
Take the case of Stomper Yogen: He noted that for two consecutive days, considerate commuters had offered their seats to his pregnant wife on the train.
Their kindness impressed him so much that he felt compelled to write to Stomp to express his heartfelt thanks for their generosity.
Meanwhile, Stomper Kelvin was heartened to see a pair of Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore officers get their hands dirty to help a woman replace a car tyre at the Causeway.
So, the next time you spot fellow Singaporeans doing something commendable, give them the recognition they deserve - take a picture and tell us about it.
These stories could well inspire others to do the right thing when it matters.
