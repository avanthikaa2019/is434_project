A 14-year-old boy used the premises of a primary school in Alor Gajah to rape a nine-year-old girl on three separate occasions during the past week, reported Harian Metro.
The boy would stalk his victim, waiting to drag the girl to the school's stairwell during break or after school.
It was reported that the boy threatened the girl with a sharp weapon each time, even pressing this against her throat to warn her against telling anyone about her ordeal.
However, the victim, a Primary Three pupil, could no longer take the abuse and informed her school authorities after she was raped for the third time.
A source said the school authorities immediately carried out an investigation and informed the girl's mother.
Alor Gajah district police chief Supt Umar Ali Saifuddin Shaharuddin confirmed that a police report had been lodged, adding that a suspect had been identified and would be arrested soon.
