RIYADH - A YouTube video of a Saudi woman defying orders by the notorious religious police to leave a mall because she was wearing nail polish has gone viral, attracting more than a million hits in just five days.
The 3 1/2-min video posted last Wednesday showed members of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice telling the woman to "get out of here (the mall)".
But she refused to comply, saying: "I'm staying and I want to know what you're going to do about it."
The unidentified woman, who was not seen on tape, shouted at bearded men from the feared religious force: "It's none of your business if I wear nail polish.
"The government has banned you from coming after us."
In January, Saudi King Abdullah appointed a moderate to head the religious police.
Sheikh Abdullatif Abdel Aziz Al-Sheikh, head of the religious force, prohibited the religious police from "harassing people" and threatening "decisive measures against violators" last month.
Over 12,000 people posted comments on the video, most of them denouncing the woman's behaviour.
