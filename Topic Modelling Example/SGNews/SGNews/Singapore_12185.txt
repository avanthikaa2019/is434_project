FIVE SBS Transit bus services - 10, 14, 16, 70M and 196 - will be diverted due to road and lane closures during this weekend's Sundown Marathon. As a result, these services will skip a total of six bus stops.
SMRT also said that its NightRider services NR1 and NR6 will be diverted temporarily between 8.45pm on Saturday and 9.30am on Sunday due to a road closure in Bayfront Avenue.
