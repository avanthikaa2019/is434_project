A recently revealed photo of South Korean actress Son Ye-jin has fired up an online debate over whether her face has changed.
In the photo, Son's nose and eyes appear to be different from before, prompting some to speculate that the actress has undergone plastic surgery.
One netizen expressed her discontent on Twitter, saying, "Why did you do it? What happened to that pretty face? You should have just aged naturally."
Another Twitter user said her face now resembled that of veteran actress No Hyun-hee.
However, others argued that the difference in appearance is due to different photo angles.
"I'm going to believe that wrong angle and poor photoshopping skills made her face look like that. Please tell me my goddess (Son) did not get plastic surgery!" posted a self-proclaimed fan of the actress.
