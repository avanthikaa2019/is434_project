This movie, filmed in the charming old town of Ching Tung, serves better as a tourism video for Taiwan.
That's because the rustic buildings and mountainous scenery are more appealing than the slow plot about a China-born singer May (Tong Yao) who loses her voice.
She then runs away from Taipei city to Ching Tung, where she meets the unassuming Xiao Mo (Chen Bo-lin).
One needs a lot of patience to appreciate this film, which questions the point of someone "disappearing" if there is nobody to find you.
This is a story of a foreigner who discovers herself through the kindness of strangers, but it isn't engaging enough.
