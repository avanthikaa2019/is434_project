DAMASCUS - State newspapers on Sunday charged that Al-Qaeda was operating in Syria and carrying out its trademark suicide bombings with the support of Washington and some Arab countries.
"The recent terrorist suicide bombings in several areas of Syria are not the first signs of Al-Qaeda's presence in Syria," but now there is "clear evidence" because of the methods and choice of targets, government daily Tishrin said.
It said "Syria is facing more than armed groups consisting of criminals fleeing the justice system" but "terrorism led by Al-Qaeda."
"This gives the Syrian state full rights to protect its citizens and maintain security and stability," the newspaper said in an editorial.
"Washington has a history of supporting terrorism" and "this is being repeated in Syria ... where terrorist groups are being funded by some Arab countries and supported by the West," it added.
Ath-Thawra, another official daily, said the West, some Arab states and others in the region were seeking to derail international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan by supporting and funding Al-Qaeda.
The US decision to provide communication equipment to "terrorists" in Syria, was "clear evidence of the link between terrorist organisations, led by Al-Qaeda, and the United States, along with its European, Arab and regional allies, particularly Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar," it said.
In the latest bomb attack in Damascus, at least 11 people were killed and 28 wounded on Friday, according to official media.
