Police have arrested a man and a minor for allegedly planting a bomb that exploded outside a prison in Surat Thani last week in a failed attempt to free a number of inmates in a jailbreak.
Police are investigating who masterminded and facilitated the jailbreak attempt, which they believe was aimed at freeing murder convict Natthaphol Yoosakul, 20, who is serving a 20-year term. The officers said a few other inmates are suspected of planning to escape with Natthaphol.
One of the bombing suspects was identified as Kittisak Kaewseekhong, 20, and the other is a 16-year-old. Police said Kittisak would have been paid around Bt100,000 by Natthaphol if the jailbreak had been successful.
Both suspects were apprehended while hiding at a friend's home in Muang district not far from the central Surat Thani prison after they were identified in security camera footage.
Police quoted Kittisak as saying he picked up a bag containing the explosives from a soldier three days before the bomb attack last Wednesday. Three bomb components were picked up later in another bag, before Natthaphol sent a signal about the day and time of the explosion. However, it was not powerful enough to demolish the prison wall.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung said the bomb attack was related to widespread drug dealings, and blamed the opposition Democrat Party, whose stronghold is in the South, for its ineffective narcotics suppression.
Speaking at a meeting of chiefs of all police stations, Chalerm said some of the recent drug-related violence stemmed from the Yingluck government's ongoing crackdown, after the Democrat-led government had "ignored" drug-related problems.
Chalerm also said he would reveal details of how the mistress of an opposition politician had deposited large amounts of money with numerous finance and securities companies. He said he would reveal the information at a Pheu Thai Party rally on Thursday at Wongwian Yai on Bangkok's Thon Buri side.
