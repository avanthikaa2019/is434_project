NEW YORK - US prosecutors on Tuesday charged 14 people including the alleged head of a New Jersey-based family which has ties to the mafia, with conducting illegal online gambling and other criminal offenses.
Joseph Lascala, 80, captain "Capo," of the Lascala crew that "together with individuals that own and operate the website Beteagle.com," illegally used off-shore sites and the Internet for betting, the US Justice Department said.
Lascala, according to charging documents, is a "made" member of the Genovese Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra and he directed the theft of goods and cargo, the receipt of stolen property, extortion and unlawful debt-collecting.
"The acts alleged in this criminal complaint show that traditional organized crime continues to pursue its bread and butter - illegal gambling, loan-sharking and cargo theft," said US Attorney Paul Fishman in a statement.
"The new wrinkle here is the use of off-shore sites and the Internet for processing bets," Fishman said, noting that the website was maintained in Costa Rica while Lascala's "agents," in New Jersey picked up money from clients.
Lascala, also known as "Pepe," and "Ziggy," of Monroe, New Jersey, and 11 co-defendants charged in connection with the conspiracy are in custody and were due to appear in a Federal Court in Newark later on Tuesday.
He and 12 of those charged could face up to 20 years in jail or up to a $250,000 fine if they are found guilty.
The 14th defendant, Ken Baran of Bayonne, New Jersey, was charged with transmitting wagering information, an offense that carries a maximum jail term of two years and up to a US$250,000 (S$313,975) fine.
Two of the 14 defendants remain at large, justice officials said.
