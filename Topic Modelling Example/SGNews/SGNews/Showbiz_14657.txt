South-Korean mixed gender group 8eight's first ever appearance in Singapore was not for a K-pop or solo concert. They are one of about 10 acts from Korea, Japan as well as Singapore scheduled to perform at this year's Music &amp; Men's Fashion Week 2012.
The trio which usually comprises female vocalist Joo Hee and two male vocalists Baek Chan and Lee Hyun, were one down with Lee Hyun unable to make it here. But Joo Hee and Baek Chan proved adept at impressing the fashion set audience as a duo.
The two were equally impressed with Singapore. "I want to go back to Korea and talk to my company about doing a music video in Singapore," said Baek Chan, who was quite taken with our island city after his walk by the Singapore River.
Organised by Fide Productions, the 5-day long fashion-cum-music affair runs from April 18 to 22 at the Marina Bay Sands.
