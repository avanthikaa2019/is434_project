PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - It is not always greed or ignorance that leads people to become victims of online scams.
Sometimes, a hectic schedule could be the cause.
"Due to our busy schedules, we tend to overlook or forget to be wary of online fraud ... until it happens to us," said Cybersecurity Malaysia CEO Lt Col (Ret) Prof Datuk Husin Jazri.
He related an incident involving a professional who ended up losing all the money in his bank account within minutes.
"He was about to go out for a meeting when he decided to quickly check his e-mail before leaving the office.
"He then saw one supposedly from his bank asking him to click on a link to update his account details.
"As he was in a hurry, he clicked on the link without much thought and followed the instructions as he was eager to proceed to his meeting.
"It was only much later that he remembered what he had done with the e-mail.
"Suddenly, it occurred to him that it was a hoax because he had heard about such a scam before."
Husin said that although the victim contacted the agency, it was already too late.
He said scammers were always "up-to-date" and took advantage of the latest banking trends and offers.
"When a bank launches a mobile banking service, the scammer will also launch a new trick to cheat mobile banking users.
"This year, several new malware known as mobile banking trojans that mimic mobile banking applications have emerged," he said.
He advised users to pay close attention to security messages posted on online banking websites.
"These initiatives are to help you, they are for your benefit," said Husin.
