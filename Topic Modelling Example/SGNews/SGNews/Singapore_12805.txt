It will be People's Action Party (PAP) candidate Desmond Choo, 34, against Workers' Party (WP) candidate Png Eng Huat, 50 in the Hougang by-elections.
Both Mr Choo and Mr Png were successful in filing their papers at the Nomination Centre at Serangoon Junior College.
Independent candidate Zeng Guoyan, 59, turned up this morning to file his nomination papers. However, he did not proceed with the filing after seeking clarifications about the qualifications to be a candidate in a parliamentary election.
Mr Zeng has a public offence on police record. In April 2008, he uttered abusive words to police officers when they entered his shophouse. He was disqualified from filing his nomination papers at the last General Elections in 2011.
The Elections Department had issued four political-donation certificates on May 16.
The other person who applied for the certificate were Dr Poh Lee Guan, 50, a veteran member of WP. However, he did not turn up on Nomination Day.
Although Dr Poh is also a member of WP, the party has expressed that they have only filed Mr Png as their candidate.
The candidates are contesting for the seat vacated after WP expelled former Hougang Member of Parliament (MP) Yaw Shin Leong in February over allegations of affairs.
On May 9, President Tony Tan issued the writ of election for the Hougang by-election, with Polling Day to be held on May 26.
Hougang has about 24,555 voters, as of 2011.
WP has held the seat since 1991.
