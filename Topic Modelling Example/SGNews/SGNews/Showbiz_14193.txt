BERLIN - A German couple on Friday opened a museum devoted to legendary British rock band, the Rolling Stones, complete with urinals in the shape of the group's famous "tongue" logo.
The museum, in the small eastern German town of Luechow, will show "thousands of pieces" of memorabilia, including an original signed pool table the group took on tour, instruments, posters and a Stones pinball machine.
The Stones-mad couple, Birgit and Ulrich Schroeder, say the museum - in a town with a population of less than 10,000 - is the world's first devoted to the ageing rockers.
The grand opening party later Friday was due to be attended by Stones backing singer Blondie Chaplin but Birgit Schroeder said she was hopeful that they would soon have a visit from one of the band members.
"There's constant contact between us and the Stones," she told AFP.
"The problem is that it is up to the management to decide, not the band. But we think that if the Rolling Stones are anywhere in the vicinity that they will come to visit us.
"But we can't expect them to fly over from San Francisco or Ireland just to visit the museum," Schroeder added.
The museum's famous urinals made headlines around the world after several local women complained they were degrading.
"It was the best publicity we could possibly have had," said Schroeder, confirming the toilets were still on display.
"People came from far away just to use the toilet."
