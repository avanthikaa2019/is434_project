ISLAMABAD - At least 100 Pakistani soldiers were buried in a remote area in the north when an avalanche hit their camp, the military said on Saturday.
The incident took place in the Siachen area of Pakistan in the Karakoram range of the Himalayas. Pakistan army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that rescue work was ongoing.
"More than 100 soldiers of NLI (Northern Light Infantry) including a colonel were trapped when the avalanche hit a military camp," Abbas said. "The rescue mission is continuing and rescuers are trying to rescue the soldiers," he added.
The avalanche hit overnight, local media said.
