SINGAPORE - Police Thursday arrested a man and a woman, aged 51 and 63, for providing false contact information to loansharks when obtaining illegal loans.
Investigations show that the two suspects used their previous residential addresses instead, which resulted in loansharks harassing the locations' current owners.
The duo is also under investigation for failing to report the change of their address under the National Registration Act.
Investigations against the two suspects are ongoing.
If convicted of providing false information, they face a maximum jail term of 12 months.
If convicted of not reporting their change of address, they face a fine up to $5,000, or a maximum jail term of five years or both.
