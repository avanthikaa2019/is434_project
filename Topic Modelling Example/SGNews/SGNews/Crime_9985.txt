This man was arrested for having sex in public - with a teddy bear.
It was his fourth time getting arrested for the same offence.
Charles Marshall, 28, received a citation last Wednesday for masturbating with the stuffed animal in an alley near the Elm Street Health Clinic in Cincinnati, Ohio, reported the Daily Mail.
This is the fourth time since 2010 that he has been arrested for pleasuring himself with a teddy bear.
Marshall received a citation for disorderly conduct in the most recent incident.
Clinic employees spotted him and called the police, WKRC Cincinnati reported.
Marshall has served short stints in jail and paid small fines for misdemeanour convictions for the previous incidents, reported The Smoking Gun.
He was first arrested in February 2010 after people at a public library contacted the authorities about him.
Witnesses said a man had been masturbating with a stuffed animal in a men's bathroom. Aj udge then told Marshall to stay away from all public libraries in Hamilton County, Ohio, The Smoking Gun reported.
Later in 2010, the police arrested Marshall for having sex with a teddy bear a second time.
An officer wrote on the police report that Marshall's public indecency with a teddy bear "has been an ongoing problem".
The third occasion that Marshall was found pleasuring himself with a toy bear was in August 2011.
He was arrested for that incident after witnesses called the authorities.
The police said he had been masturbating with a stuffed animal in a place where it was likely that minors were present.
It is unclear whether Marshall used the same teddy bear on each occasion.
