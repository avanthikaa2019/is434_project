SINGAPORE - A former secondary school contract teacher was jailed for 10 months on Tuesday for attempting to get a 13-year-old girl to commit an indecent act, reported The Straits Times.
The 48-year-old is married with three children.
He had asked her via a text message if she would be willing to masturbate him on Dec 10, 2010.
The accused was a relief teacher for the girl's class in late 2010 and added her on Facebook as a contact.
He later got hold of her mobile number and sent her a total of 26 text messages between Nov 24, 2010 and Jan 11, 2011. Many of the messages were sexually explicit in nature.
She also turned down his request for her to be his girlfriend.
His explicit approach came to light when the girl confided in her senior from the National Police Cadet Corps.
