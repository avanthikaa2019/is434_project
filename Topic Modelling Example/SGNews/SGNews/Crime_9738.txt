The murder weapons told the horrific nature of the death - a steel pipe and a smashed television set.
The murder victims were Mr Lee Yoke Ming, 70, and his wife, Madam Lee Kim Lin, 68, and the alleged murderer is their nephew, a 44-year-old mechanic, who is said to be mentally unstable, The Star reported.
He was arrested after he allegedly beat his uncle to death with the steel pipe before crushing his aunt with the television set.
The incident happened early morning yesterday in Serdang, Selangor.
The man was found covered in blood by his parents shortly after the incident.
The man's father, who was not named, told The Star: "We had left the house at 4.30am to open our fruit stall in the nearby market when a neighbour called me saying they had heard cries for help coming from our house.
"We rushed home and found my brother and his wife dead, while my son was covered in blood." It is believed the uncle constantly teased his nephew for being slow, which may have provoked the attack.
The father added: "He (the son) was trying to wash the blood from his hands when I found him. He then looked at me and asked me what he should do."
He said he advised him to go to the police. The man surrendered to the police, who had arrived at the scene by then.
