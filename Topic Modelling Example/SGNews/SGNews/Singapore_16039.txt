A party that was to be held at Chijmes and which riled the Catholic community has been cancelled after the management of Chijmes stepped in yesterday.
Perennial Retail Manage- ment, which manages Chijmes, told the media that it "strongly disapproves the hosting of any event at Chijmes...that disrespects religions, faiths and races".
The Escape Chapel Party, scheduled for Saturday, came under fire two days ago when netizens found images of young women dressed in skimpy nun-like outfits on the event's Facebook page.
The organisers, Creative Insurgence and Escape Swansea have expressed their disappointment over the cancellation.
"It is a pity. We were looking to expand into Sin- gapore. This event was about the music," said Mr David Griffiths, chief executive of Escape Swansea.
