MANCHESTER - Japan international Shinji Kagawa is set to become Manchester United's first summer signing after the Premier League club confirmed Tuesday they have "reached agreement" with his club Borussia Dortmund.
"Manchester United is delighted to announce that it has agreed terms with both Borussia Dortmund and Shinji Kagawa for his transfer to the club," said a United statement.
"The deal is subject only to the player medical and obtaining a UK work permit. These conditions are anticipated to be completed by the end of June. "Further details will be announced in due course."
The 23-year-old attacking midfielder is currently on international duty and played in Japan's 3-0 World Cup qualifying round victory over Oman at the weekend.
Kagawa cost Dortmund just 350,000 euros when he joined from J-League side Cerezo Osaka in 2010. He has scored 21 goals in 49 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia, helping them win back-to-back league titles.
