Two non-Chinese teams took part in a so-called "dry" dragonboat race for the first time in the Duan Wu Carnival yesterday.
The Toa Payoh Central Community Club Malay and Indian Activity Executive Committees competed with 22 other groups from grassroots organisations and Chinese clan associations from all over Singapore.
The "dry" dragonboat race involved 24 teams, each comprising six members, running a 50m course while having their feet strapped onto two long planks.
The Singapore Chin Kang Huay Kuan, a Chinese clan association, won the race.
The carnival, now in its second year, was co-organised by the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA) and Toa Payoh Central Community Club.
Held at the Toa Payoh Community Library's amphitheatre, the event commemorated the Dumpling Festival, which falls on Saturday this year.
Mr Chua Thian Poh, president of SFCCA, told my paper: "This was the first time we invited other ethnic groups to participate. This will help other ethnic groups understand our culture."
The event saw more than 5,000 people participate - a five-fold increase from the 1,000 participants last year.
Dr Ng Eng Hen, Defence Minister and Member of Parliament for the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, was the guest of honour.
He said: "As a multiracial nation, we want these events to help foster understanding and appreciation of different cultures within our community and strengthen social bonding."
Mr Zhou Zhao Cheng, chairman of the SFCCA's Social Affairs Committee and editor of Zaobao.com, said that the event can also help integrate new immigrants into the community.
Three new-immigrant associations participated this year.
The Dumpling Festival is held on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar. It is also called Duan Wu Jie, or the Dragon Boat Festival.
