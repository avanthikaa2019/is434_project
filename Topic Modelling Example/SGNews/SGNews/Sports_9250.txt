SINGAPORE - A group of 30 young dancers from a Singapore dance studio, Jitterbugs Swingapore, will be flying to Perth in July to compete in the Commonwealth Society of Teachers of Dancing (CSTD) Festival of Dance.
The society provides examinations and syllabi for all major dance disciplines throughout Australia and Asia.
Competitions, festivals, championships and other activities are programmed each year to meet the needs of members in each region.
The Perth Competition Festival will be held from July 6 to 15 at Swan Park Calisthenics Theatre, and will feature competitors from Australia, Hong Kong, China, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore.
The young dancers from Jitterbugs Swingapore are already veterans of the competition scene. Some have competed in Singapore competitions and last year a group also travelled to Bangkok where they successfully competed in the CSTD Asia-Pacific Competitions.
This year, the group consists of dancers ranging from six to 14 years old, from a variety of nationalities, including Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and Japan.
With the blessings of their parents, many of whom are accompanying the group, they will be missing a week of school to compete in tap, lyrical jazz, jazz and ballet divisions.
They will compete in duos, trios, groups and in solos as well.
The group has been trained and choreographed by Ms Tiffany Wrightson, who is herself a Perth native and the head of CSTD at Jitterbugs Swingapore.
