ROME - Russian defending champion Maria Sharapova beat Germany's Angelique Kerber 6-3, 6-4 to set up a Rome Masters final against Li Na of China.
Sharapova advanced in 89 minutes against Kerber, whose move into the WTA top-10 on Monday will complete a line-up for 10 different nationalities at the summit of the women's game.
Li, who will defend her French Open title when the grand slam starts a week from Sunday, reached the title match at the Foro Italico without hitting a ball in her semi-final as opponent Serena Williams withdrew, claiming back pain but admitting the pullout was really just a precaution.
"When I was warming up this morning, I was really looking forward to playing against one of the best players ever," said Li, who has not won a title since her triumph in Paris a year ago.
"Of course I'm happy to reach the final but I don't like winning like that. I am so sorry for Serena and hope she gets healthy."
Sharapova earned revenge against 12th seed Kerber after losing to the German at the Paris Indoors in February after beating her only a few weeks earlier in the Australian Open third round.
The Russian world number two, whose Rome trophy was one of two she lifted in 2011, ended with 27 winners and 25 unforced errors, breaking four times. Kerber managed only nine winners but did put her opponent under pressure in each set before finally losing.
Sharapova already owns a clay title in 2012 after winning Stuttgart last month in her debut appearance over number one and main rival Victoria Azarenka.
The Russian has advanced into the Sunday title match without losing a set against the only player outside the top-10 to defeat her this season (Paris).
