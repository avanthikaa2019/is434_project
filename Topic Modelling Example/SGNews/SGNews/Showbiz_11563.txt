You want rock? You got it at the 2012 F1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix.
British singer-songwriter Noel Gallagher is the latest chart-topping artiste to join the stellar line-up at the 2012 F1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix.
Gallagher is set to unleash a set comprising of some of his best new songs from his self-titled album, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, as well as some other Gallagher-penned classics from his time in Oasis.
Gallagher will perform at the Padang stage (Zone 4) on Sept 22 and at the Village Stage at Gate 1 (Zone 1) before the F1 race on Sept 23. Other artistes performing at the Marina Bay Street Circuit includes Jay Chou, Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Bananarama, Pretenders and The Proclaimers.
Two years after his departure from English rock band Oasis in Oct 2009, he released Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, which debuted at No. 1 on the British album charts.
Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, with its psychedelic tinges, eternal themes of love, loss and hope, takes on an array of musical inspiration from the New Orleans ragtime stomp of The Death of You and Me, to the Ennio Morricone-inspired, string-laden Everybody's On The Run.
The catchy AKA&hellip;What A Life!, one of Gallagher's favourite tracks on the album, and Everybody's On The Run has been hailed as "his best tunes in 15 years" by the Guardian.
The debut album has topped the charts in Britain on release, selling over 650,000 copies in UK, and certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry making it the second biggest-selling rock album of 2011 in the UK. The album has sold over 1 million worldwide.
Tickets to catch Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as well as the spectacular track action and other entertainment at the 2012 F1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix are available online at www.singaporegp.sg.
