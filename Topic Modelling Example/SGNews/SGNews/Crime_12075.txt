SINGAPORE - The general practitioner involved in a hit-and-run accident, which killed a cyclist in 2010, has been sentenced to four weeks imprisonment and slapped with a five-year ban from driving.
The cyclist, Mok Chee Kong, 35, died when he was hit by a car driven by Teo Tiong Kiat, 65, along Clementi Road on March 21 that year.
Teo had earlier admitted to causing the freelance writer's death by a negligent act and causing hurt to the other rider, but claimed trial to three other charges including failing to stop, failing to help, and for moving his vehicle without police permission.
On Friday, Teo was sentenced for all five charges.
A witness testified that Teo's car had swerved into the extreme left lane suddenly and collided with the two cyclists. Teo did not stop but drove on for about 600m before returning 40 minutes later.
Although he had a glass of wine before the accident, Teo passed a breath test conducted at the police station later.
His defence was that he was not aware that he had hit the cyclists.
But District Judge John Ng disagreed. He noted that the way in which the accident occurred, including extensive damages left on the car, rendered it impossible for the driver to be ignorant of what had happened.
Teo is not appealing and will serve his sentence from June 1.
