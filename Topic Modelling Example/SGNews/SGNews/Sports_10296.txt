A man died after suffering a fatal blow to his head during a cricket match in Cranleigh, England.
David Wilcockson, 71, from Dorking, collapsed on the pitch when the batsman's shot struck him on the head.
He was transferred immediately to the King's College hospital in London. He remained in a coma for 13 days before he died on June 1.
Wilcockson, a retired salesman, had been the longest serving member of the Old Dorkinians, a cricket club based in Dorking.
His team had been playing against Grafham when the accident occurred.
He was not married.
"He was a very considerate person," said his sister, Heather Scaplehorn, 72. "You could rely on him."
Wilcockson's funeral is expected to take place next month.
