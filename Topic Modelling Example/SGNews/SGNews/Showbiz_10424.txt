If you like it, you should put a Lamborghini on it.
US reality TV star Kim Kardashian, 31, has splurged US$750,000 (S$962,000) on a Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 sports car as a 35th birthday present for her beau, US rapper Kanye West.
Entertainment website TMZ reported that Kardashian took a video of the supercar to show to West, who celebrated his birthday last week and is now touring Europe with US rap mogul Jay-Z.
But West has played it cool thus far about his swanky gift, only tweeting: "Thanks for all my fans. I am tweeting under the stage while Jay is rapping in Dublin on my birthday. You guys make all my dreams possible."
