The build-up to the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) elections was quite intense. On one side of the ring was the incumbent - chairman Rangarajan Narayanamohan and his team - and facing them were the challengers led by MMI chairman and chief executive officer T. Chandroo.
Both men had assembled strong teams but, by the time the votes were counted on April 17, it was Mr Narayanamohan who was re-elected as SICCI chairman. The senior partner at accounting firm Natarajan &amp; Swaminathan got the better of Dr Chandroo by 125 votes and will serve a second term, from 2012 to 2014.
Moving on to the rest of the board, Mr K.V. Aiyappan and Mr Prakash Pillai were elected as vice-chairmen while 13 more industry professionals will serve the two-year term as directors.
Mr Narayanamohan said the new board will continue to expand and develop networks to fulfil the business needs of its member community: "SICCI's current membership is nearing 1,000 and this is a milestone for the chamber. We target to bring in more members and raise the membership to 1,500."
He added that SICCI will also focus on further strengthening and developing relevant platforms to allow its members to successfully tap the emerging economic opportunities across Myanmar, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
Here is the SICCI board of directors for 2012-14 which will be sworn in on April 24: Mr R. Narayanamohan, Mr K.V. Aiyappan, Mr Prakash Pillai, Mr Malaiappan, Mr A. Dinakaran, Mr Bagaria Rajan, Mr C.
