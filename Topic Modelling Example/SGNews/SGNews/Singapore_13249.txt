SINGAPORE Singapore will release detailed first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data at 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) on May 17, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Thursday.
Due to better-than-expected manufacturing and tourism data for March, the government survey will likely show the economy expanded at a slightly faster pace than the 1.6 percent year-on-year growth reported in April's flash estimate.
