Zac Efron goes from High School Musical to Old School Romance as Logan Thibault, a marine who goes to North Carolina to look for a mystery woman, Beth (Taylor Schiling), whose photo he picked up from the rubble in war-torn Iraq.
And so begins a tentative connection of pretty faces with a fair share of heartaches.
Since this is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, who believes love is best served with a certain soppy level of sentiment, well... Let's just say, you know what to expect, eh?
The Lucky One (PG13) Drama/101 minutes Rating: 2.5 stars
