Motorola DEFY XT smartphone NOT all smartphones are created equal. The best available Android phones now are Samsung's Galaxy SIII and HTC's 1X, but they cost quite a bundle.
If one is prepared to settle for fewer bells and whistles, Motorola's DEFY XT is a viable choice. It is not only much cheaper but also has many of the features of higher-priced phones.
DEFY XT is water, dust and scratch resistant, and comes with a huge battery (1,700mAh) which can deliver up to 91/2 hours of talktime.
Sure, it does not have Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) - it comes with Gingerbread (2.3) OS. Nor is there a high-megapixel camera - only 5MP on this Motorola. The screen, at 3.7 inches, also seems diminutive.
However, technical specifications by themselves do not make a good phone. I would say the DEFY XT is a pretty good and value-for-money Android phone that does the job. It works well and is durable. No need to take extra precautions to protect it as it is meant to be tossed around.
How much: $399
