It has been a confidence-boosting run of games for Singapore's No. 1 paddler Gao Ning - a run that may culminate in an unexpected title in Japan.
Last Satuday, at GAC Group 2012 ITTF World Tour Japan Open in Kobe, the 29-year-old surged into the semi-finals on the back of consecutive victories in the round of 16 and the ensuing quarter-finals.
In the Round of 16, Gao stumbled out of the gates, losing the first set to Hong Kong's Tang Peng.
But he regained focus, won three sets on the trot, and eventually beat his 34th-ranked opponent 4-11, 11-8, 11-8, 12-10, 8-11, 11-7.
In the quarter-finals, the 2010 Commonwealth Games gold medallist dispatched his Taiwanese opponent, world No. 8 Chuang Chih-yuan, with relative ease, winning 11-9, 9-11, 12-10, 11-6, 11-4.
After losing in the first round of the recent China Open in Shanghai, it was a welcome return to form for the nation's best male paddler - especially with the 2012 Olympics just around the corner.
Gao will look to secure a final berth in his semi-finals match last Sunday against Korea's Oh Sang Eun.
Compatriot Yu Mengyu failed to advance into the women's singles semi-finals, despite shocking top seed Ishikawa Kasumi in the 11-8, 11-6, 5-11, 12-14, 11-6, 13-11 in the Round of 16.
She fell to Korean Dang Ye Seo in a seven-set thriller in the quarter-finals, succumbing 11-7, 10-12, 7-11, 11-5, 13-11, 11-13, 3-11.
In the women's doubles, Sun Beibei and Yu lost in the semi-finals to Koreans Dang and Seok Ha Jung.
