KUALA LUMPUR - Thousands of violent crimes involving firearms which went cold and were languishing in police files are under the spotlight again.
Police are re-looking such cases as they arm themselves with a new tool called IBIS (Integrated Ballistics Identification System) in their combat against crime.
"Since the implementation of IBIS last year, we have managed to reopen 25 cold cases and bring them to court.
"Without IBIS, we could manage breakthroughs in about 10 such cold cases, which we call cold hits, in a year," federal forensics principal assistant director Senior Asst Comm Dr Yew Chong Hooi told The Star.
Just like in the popular television show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, IBIS is capable of solving crimes within an hour, able to match a bullet to one out of 15,000 firearms in the database in 60 minutes.
"This means any gun-related case never goes cold as it is always compared to the bullets collected at any crime scene," he said.
SAC Dr Yew said the RM10mil system, which was acquired from Canada, had more than doubled the efficiency of ballistics identification and turned all cold cases back to "hot" again.
The new system, he said, which stores all the ballistics data electronically, is able to link instantly to other cases which have the same ballistic signature.
"If a gun was used to commit a crime in Penang a month ago and then used in another crime in Johor, both cases would be automatically linked.
"This is much more efficient than the previous method of our forensic team manually checking through files to match the cases which could take a long time," he said.
SAC Dr Yew said police were also going to share ballistics database with neighbouring countries and Interpol to catch international criminals and possibly even terrorists.
Currently, only two IBIS systems are available in the ballistics department at the main forensic laboratory at the Royal Malaysian Police College in Cheras, with three more to be added this year at various locations.
