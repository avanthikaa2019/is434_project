Instead of helping out the Japanese victim who laid dying and trapped in the taxi in the Ferrari crash, a man resorted to stealing her money.
According to Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao, the man who looked to be in his 30s, picked up notes and coins scattered around the mangled taxi.
57-year-old Mr Lim, a cleaner from Malaysia, told the paper that the woman, who was later identified as Shigemi Ito, cried out in pain when the man pocketed the money and ran off.
Reports said the man pocketed about $300 in all. Mr Lim was not able to react in time to stop the man, the report said.
Miss Ito was later brought to the Singapore General Hospital where she died.
In a horrific accident last Saturday, a speeding Ferrari slammed into a ComfortDelGro taxi leaving three dead and two injured.
The Ferrari driver died on the spot. The taxi driver, 52-year-old Mr Cheng Teck Hock suffered head injuries and died on Sunday.
