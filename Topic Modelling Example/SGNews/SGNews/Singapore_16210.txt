From today, a new department under the Singapore Police Force will regulate licensing regimes that were previously managed by two separate units.
The Police Licensing &amp; Regulatory Department was formed from a merger of the Police Security Industry Regulatory Department (Sird) and the Police Licensing Division, the SPF said yesterday in a statement.
The merger will create "greater synergy and ensure better consistency" in the areas of policy formulation, licensing processes and enforcement actions for all SPF licensing regimes, except for traffic-related licenses.
The new department allows all the licensing regimes to be housed under one roof at the Police Cantonment Complex.
It will allow "for the provision of a one-stop service for all police-related license applications".
Sird, formed in 2004, was the regulatory authority of the private-security industry.
Its counterpart, the Licensing Division, regulated various activities through the issuance and administration of licenses and permits by its units, namely the Public Entertainment and Liquor Licensing Unit, the General Licensing Unit and the Arms &amp; Explosives Branch.
The types of licensing regimes and permits regulated by the Licensing Division include those for public entertainment, liquor, massage establishments and private lotteries.
