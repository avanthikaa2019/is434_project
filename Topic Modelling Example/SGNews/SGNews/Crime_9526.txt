A taxi driver paid $100 for the sexual services of an undrage Vietnamese girl.
On Monday, he was sentenced to three months' jail.
Chong Heng Kow, 53, admitted to one count of paid sex with the 16-year-old girl in Geylang last year on July 3.
The court was told that a Vietnamese national Ngo Tien, 31, arranged for the girl to meet her husband, Seng Swee Meng, 41, and Chong at a coffeeshop near Lorong 42 Geylang.
Chong paid the girl $100 for sex at the Fragrance Ruby hotel.
Seng, a pimp, is serving five years' jail while Ngo Tien is on the run. Seng was jailed for five years after pleading guilty to 15 charges, including two counts of abetting to obtain commercial sex with minors.
Chong could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined for commercial sex with a person under 18 years of age.
