The paid maternity leave for female employees would be extended from the current 90 calendar days to 98, Beijing Times reported Thursday, quoting a new draft regulation on the labor protection of women.
Women who have miscarriages (abortions included) are also entitled to paid leave.
Those who have been pregnant for less than four months are allowed to take miscarriage leave of no less than two weeks, and those who have carried their unborn babies beyond four months can rest for at least six weeks, according to the draft regulation reviewed and approved by the State Council on Wednesday.
