RAWANG - Three men, believed to be Indonesians, were killed in a shootout with the police at Taman Templer Saujana near here during an early morning attempted robbery.
It was learnt that the robbers were trying to break into a house belonging to contractor Mohd Azhar Nordin, 46, in Jalan TS12 here when they were spotted by policemen patrolling the area.
Two of the suspects were trying to enter the double-storey house while another was waiting in a car.
Realising the police's presence, the two suspects rushed into their car and tried to escape, but they did not get very far as their vehicle skidded a short distance away.
The suspects alighted from their Proton Wira and tried to escape on foot.
Selangor CID chief Senior Asst Comm Mohd Adnan Abdullah said that when the policemen introduced themselves, the suspects opened fire. This forced the police to return fire, killing all three on the spot.
Police seized a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol at the scene.
They also found house-breaking tools in the robbers' car which was reported stolen in Puchong on Jan 7.
"At the contractor's house, we found signs of an attempted break-in. We also found a handphone and a bag that we believe belonged to the robbers," he said.
At the time of the incident, Mohd Azhar was out of town, while his wife, three children and a maid had slept through all the drama.
They only realised that their house was almost broken into and that the suspects had been shot dead after being informed by the police.
Mohd Azhar said he received a call from his wife and rushed home immediately.
He said his house had been robbed six times in the last three years.
The last time his house was robbed was last year when robbers fled with his daughter's jewellery.
The bodies were sent to Kuala Lumpur hospital for post-mortem.
