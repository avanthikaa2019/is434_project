TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda left for Beijing Saturday for an annual summit with South Korean and Chinese leaders to discuss a trilateral free trade pact and ways to deal with North Korea.
He will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Sunday as experts fear the reclusive state will test a nuclear weapon.
"I would like to engage in discussions so that an agreement to start (free trade) negotiations will be reached," Noda told reporters before he left his residence.
He also said the three nations would step up joint efforts to prevent a possible North Korean nuclear test, after Pyongyang's failed rocket launch last month that the United States and its allies said was a disguised ballistic missile test banned under UN resolutions.
"Japan, China and South Korea will strengthen cooperation so that it will not conduct a new provocative act," he said, referring to North Korea.
The leaders will also discuss a wide range of subjects, including the environment.
