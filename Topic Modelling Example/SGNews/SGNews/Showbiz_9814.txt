KUALA LUMPUR - Life for model Joey Cheah has been a living hell as she receives over 100 calls and text messages daily from people soliciting sexual services from her.
The 26-year-old said the calls and messages started pouring in after "advertisements" bearing her pictures and handphone number were circulated on social networks and Internet blogs early this month.
"I get unwanted calls and messages day and night, even in the early hours of the morning. I am emotionally and mentally traumatised," she said during a press conference at the MCA Public Services and Complaints Department office here yesterday.
Cheah, who is from Penang, said one of the advertisements stated that she "likes to have sex with men who pay her good money".
"My mother is also very stressed out and worried," said Cheah, who is an only child.
She said that she was also afraid that such advertisements would damage her reputation and ruin her modelling career.
Although both the managements of Facebook and Twitter have shut down the pages with the advertisements after she reported the abuse, Cheah said she was still being hounded by calls and messages from those who visit social escort service blogs and websites.
She said she believed that whoever put up the advertisements, which also contained vulgarities and crude words, had taken her pictures from her Facebook fan page, adding that it could be someone who was "jealous" of her.
Department head Datuk Seri Michael Chong said he would help Cheah obtain legal advice and lodge a police report.
"Anyone who sees these advertisements should immediately know that this woman has been framed.
"So, please do not call her. We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of the matter and nab the culprit," he said, adding that Cheah's case was the first of its kind this year.
