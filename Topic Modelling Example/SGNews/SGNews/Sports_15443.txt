SYDNEY - A 51-year-old mother said Wednesday she felt "fantastic" but tired after becoming the first woman to run across Australia's Simpson Desert, enduring searing temperatures on the 660 kilometre journey.
Intensive care nurse Jane Trumper had attempted the 410-mile run last year, only to be stopped at 352 kilometres (220 miles) by bushfires.
Trumper said the relentless desert heat had been difficult on the run which began at the geographical centre of Australia in the Northern Territory, detoured through South Australia and ended in Birdsville, southwest Queensland.
"It was 45 degrees (Celsius, 113 degrees Fahrenheit) on the first day and I really had doubts about whether I would absolutely get this thing done," she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"No female has ever done it, so I think that was in the back of my mind that it would be good to do something that no one has ever done."
Sydney-based Trumper had to run 750 kilometres in total because of a detour caused by recent heavy rains. According to her blog, she completed the run on Tuesday after 10 days.
The ultramarathon runner, who was raising money for a Sydney children's hospital charity, said she was happy with how she felt after the run.
"It was the heat, the flies and the last couple of days I had a headwind, so the running was very, very slow," Trumper told the ABC.
"I actually feel fantastic. I am a bit croaky, with all the dust from the last couple of days, with the wind.
"My calves are tight, there's a couple of blisters on my feet - but pretty good really."
Trumper was accompanied by two vehicles, with two supporters in each, on the journey during which she knew she would be facing snakes and extreme heat.
"It will be hot. There will be some treacherous, slippery and slow areas of muddy clay pans after the rain. Will let you know if mud is more fun than the fires that stopped me in September," she blogged last month.
