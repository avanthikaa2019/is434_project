TAIPEI - Taiwan's leading smartphone maker HTC on Thursday denied reports that it would be excluded by Microsoft from adopting the new operating system Windows 8 in its products.
"HTC has sold more than 40 million Windows Phones over the last 10 years and we are committed to future versions of Microsoft's Windows Phone platform more than ever," a company statement said.
Windows 8 is touted as Microsoft's long-awaited riposte to the rise of Apple and mobile devices powered by Google's Android operating system. There is no official release date but reports have predicted an October launch.
HTC touts its own brand of smartphones and also makes handsets for a number of leading US companies, including Google's Nexus One.
The company faces stiff competition from rivals Apple and Samsung and has revised down its earning forecast for the 2012 second quarter citing delay in shipments to the US market.
Last month, US mobile carrier Sprint said it was delaying the introduction of an Android smartphone from HTC after the devices were blocked by US customs.
HTC said Thursday that the US Customs office "has reviewed and approved HTC devices for import into the US, as they are in compliance with the ruling" by the US International Trade Commission.
Apple won an order last December from ITC, which issued a "limited exclusion order" directing that HTC stop bringing offending smartphones into the United States effective on April 19.
Apple has accused HTC and other smartphone makers using Google's Android mobile operating system of infringing on Apple-held patents. A separate case is pending against Samsung.
