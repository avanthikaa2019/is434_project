SENDAI - The owner of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle found on a beach on Graham Island in Canada's British Columbia, has been identified as a resident of Yamamoto, Miyagi Prefecture, a town devastated by the March 11, 2011, tsunami.
The bike owned by 29-year-old Ikuo Yokoyama, an official of the Yamamoto municipal government, was found inside a trucking container on the island last month. Yokoyama confirmed that the numbers on the bike's license plate, seen in newspaper photos and TV news, matched his bike's numbers on Wednesday. "I hope there will be a way for the bike to be returned home--at least the license plate," he said.
Harley-Davidson Motor Co. is willing to grant Yokoyama's wish, a public relations official of Harley-Davidson Japan said. The Wisconsin-based company is considering sending the bike to Japan and repairing it there, all at the company's cost, the spokesman said.
