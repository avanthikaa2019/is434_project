GEORGE TOWN - Police have arrested four members of a syndicate that cheated people of their money by warning them they are targeted for investigation by Bank Negara and the Home Ministry.
The four, including a woman, were picked up after three months of investigations by the police commercial crimes division. Investigators also seized 22 bank account passbooks, 53 debit cards, 33 automated teller machine cards, 27 bank-in slips, 33 prepaid mobile packs, RM658, three books containing a database of account holders and a Perodua Myvi.
Penang commercial crime chief Assistant Commissioner Roslee Chik said they were still looking for the syndicate's mastermind. Roslee said members of the syndicate would call people and tell them that Hong Kong police had caught a man who was suspected to have used the victim's account for money laundering purposes.
"They would then ask the person to transfer whatever is left in his account to another account for 'safekeeping' as his account would be frozen," he said.
Roslee warned the public to be wary of these callers who pretended to be Bank Negara or Home Ministry officials. Police had received a report from a man in Permatang Pauh, who had fallen into the fraudsters' trap by following their order to deposit RM70,000 into two bank accounts.
