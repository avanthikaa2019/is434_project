KLANG, Malaysia - A video has emerged showing a burly, long-haired man attacking a small-sized woman at a used-car dealership here.
The five-minute clip that surfaced on YouTube on Wednesday also shows several men ransacking the place and carrying away some of the loot.
A news portal has reported that the ugly attack happened at the premises of the shop.
While the man in the jacket and woman were involved in a heated exchange of words in the office, another woman walked aimlessly by and at least three others sat quietly behind their workstations.
Another man with what looks like a metal rod can also be seen standing by while two men with cameras shoot the dramatic scenes.
The woman was seen trying to escape several times and was, at one time, pushed against a pillar by the man.
He also grabbed, pushed and kicked her each time she tried to get away or ward off his blows.
The man also grabbed a file from the office table, which the woman is seen trying to pull back from him.
When she eventually sat, the bully and the man with the iron rod are seen talking to her in an unruly manner.
North Klang OCPD Supt Shukor Sulong said police were aware about the incident.
"It took place on April 7 and we are still investigating the case," Supt Shukor said.
On reports that the unruly visitors were unhappy customers who felt they had been cheated by the car dealer, Supt Shukor said: "There are several fraud cases in such businesses and thorough checks must be conducted."
Netizens who commented on the YouTube posting said complaints had previously been lodged against the dealer, accused of cheating car buyers.
A news portal alleged that the attack was carried out by a mob of disgruntled customers from an underworld gang.
They reportedly took away five cars, two laptops, wallets and belongings of some staff members, as well as nearly RM70,000 (S$28,658) in cash.
