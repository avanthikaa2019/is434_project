The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has arrested 97 people, including eight for drug trafficking and 89 for drug use, in a two-day operation across Singapore.
In a statement released on Wednesday, CNB said drugs of nearly $170,000 in value were found during the multiple raids conducted from June 25 to June 27.
Approximately 625 grammes of heroin, 235 grammes of Ice and varying amounts of cannabis, ketamine, Erimin-5 and Ecstasy were seized.
Of the total amount seized, an estimated $144,000 worth of drugs, including heroin, Ice, Erimin-5 and others, were found on three men arrested at Outram on June 25.
Two of the men, a 44-year-old and a 46-year-old, are believed to have obtained the drugs from a 22-year-old Malaysian man, who was also arrested in the vicinity.
All three have been charged for drug trafficking and may face the death penalty if found guilty.
A raid in Simei also resulted in the arrest of two suspected drug suppliers and an alleged drug user.
Two of the men, a 25-year-old and a 39-year-old, were found to be in possession of illegal drugs and drug packing utensils.
They could be charged for drug trafficking and face a minimum of five years imprisonment and five strokes of the cane if convicted.
