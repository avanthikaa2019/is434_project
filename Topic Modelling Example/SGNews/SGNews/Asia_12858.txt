BEIJING - More than 150 people were rescued from a stricken Taiwanese passenger ship near China's coast on Tuesday, officials said, after the vessel started taking in water.
The "Golden Dragon" boat - with 153 people on board, including five crew members - was on its way from Taiwan's Matsu island to China's southeastern province of Fujian when it ran into difficulties.
The island's county government said in a statement that the leak likely happened when the ship hit a large chunk of wood under water.
A spokesman for Fujian's maritime affairs bureau, surnamed Wang, told AFP that the passengers and crew were rescued late on Tuesday morning and had been safely taken to land.
"Currently, the body of the ship is ok, but it needs to be towed to a ship factory for repairs."
The accident comes just over four months after the Costa Concordia cruise liner ran aground off northwest Italy with some 3,200 passengers aboard, killing 32 people.
