KUALA LUMPUR - In what appears to be a heated lovers' quarrel, a 22-year-old woman was torched at a flat she shared with her boyfriend in Cheras.
Firemen who rushed to the Taman Segar flat on receiving an emergency call found Chan Yee Mun motionless with 90 per cent burns on her body in the 2.30am incident yesterday.
She was rushed to the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Hospital.
Police sources said her condition is critical.
Her 33-year-old boyfriend, a stall owner, was treated for injuries on his hands and arms at the same hospital.
A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said he was awakened by a loud noise coming from the pair's flat.
The taxi driver said he rushed to the unit and was shocked to see flames. He immediately called the Fire and Rescue Department and the police.
"The two were always fighting. But this is the first time such a horrible incident has happened," he said.
Cheras OCPD Asst Comm Mohan Singh said police are questioning the boyfriend over the incident, which is being investigated under Section 307 of the Penal Code as attempted murder.
