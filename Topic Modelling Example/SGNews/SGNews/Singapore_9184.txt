More than 750 households staying in Blocks 134 to 139 in Bedok North Street 2 will be among the first few to be offered items such as ramps and grab bars for greater accessibility and mobility.
This is the Household Board's latest bid to make life easier for elderly residents under the Enhancement for Active Seniors (Ease) plan which was announced in March.
Most of the $2,000 cost for these enhancements will be paid by the Government and residents will need to pay between $100 and $250, depending on the flat type.
For this amount, residents can get up to 10 grab bars installed in their home, have slip-resistant treatment done to bathroom tiles and install ramps at the entrance and within the flat where feasible.
The Ease programme is expected to vost about $260 million and benefit 130,000 Housing Board residents.
Minister of State for National Development Lee Yi Shyan made the announcement this morning and explained how it works.
From Sunday, Ease will be packaged under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), which is aimed at fixing problems associated with older flats, such as reparing of spalling concrete and structural cracks, replacement of laundry pipe sockets with easier-to-use clothes drying racks, as well as replacement of waste pipes.
Under HIP, these essential improvements are done for free.
Optional upgrades such as upgrading the toilet or replacing the main door, come at a subsidised price.
Residents will need to pay between five to 12.5 per cent, depending on the size of the flat.
However, before the projects can start, majority of eligible residents, or about 75 per cent, must first vote in favour of the programme.
Elderly residents staying in two mature estates, Kallang-Whampoa and Bukit Merah, will be the first to be able to send their applications for Ease directly to HDB starting tomorrow.
HDB will provide more details soon and will study the response and feedback from these two towns before offering direct applications for Ease to more estates.
