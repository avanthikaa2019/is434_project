Only serious photographers need consider Canon's latest DSLR camera.
The EOS-1D X is being touted as the ultimate solution for professional photographers by combining high image quality with high continuous shooting speeds. It uses an 18.1-megapixel CMOS sensor that promises to faithfully capture a scene with minimal noise, thanks to its larger pixel and sensor size.
For sports photographers looking to catch the right moment, minimum shutter-release lag for the EOS-1D X has been reduced to 36 milliseconds and it has an optional super high-speed continuous shooting mode of 14 frames per second.
