In addition to her bowling accolades, Jazreel Tan received her third consecutive Academic All-American award earlier this year.
It is given to student-athletes with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher on all course work. But it certainly hasn't been easy getting there.
Asked to describe her typical day, Tan said: "I am usually up getting ready for school at 7am, with classes between 8am and 2pm.
"If I have short breaks in between classes, I would study or work out a bit, and my training is between 2pm and 5.30pm.
"After training, I would go home, which is about 10 minutes' drive from campus, if there are no more classes and rest a while before starting on my schoolwork."
The self-professed night owl feels she is most productive after midnight, and sleeps in the wee hours of the morning when she's done.
She'd go for a run or work out whenever she's stressed or feeling frustrated, but prefers "slacking at home" otherwise.
The avid Liverpool fan sometimes would catch 'live' Reds games, even if they are broadcast at 6am in the United States.
She said: "I started liking them when Michael Owen was at his hottest, both in terms of looks and form.
"My dad hates Liverpool, he is an Arsenal fan. My brother supports Liverpool though, and I was influenced by him."
The influence also extends to literature, as her elder brother Andrew's love for Nicholas Sparks novels has rubbed off on her.
"I have all of his books. He started liking the author first, after watching The Notebook. Then I was influenced and started buying the novels," said the Jay Chou fan.
Outside of bowling, Tan enjoys playing football and ultimate frisbee, and picked up the latter about five years ago.
Asked to reveal something that not many people might know about Tan or "Jazzy", long-time friend and national teammate Jasmine Yeong-Nathan said: "She never sleeps without Milo!"
