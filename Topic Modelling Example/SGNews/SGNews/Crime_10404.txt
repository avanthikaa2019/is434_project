SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia - Four armed men wearing ski masks broke into a Chinese school here and fled with RM30,000 (S$12,282) from a safe and several vehicles after tying up 11 people in an early morning robbery here.
Subang Jaya Deputy OCPD Supt Tan Ah Chua said the four entered the school at about 2am.
One had what looked like a gun while another held a parang to two of the security guards.
The guards were then tied up.
In the next four hours, the robbers also held up four school canteen staff, a maintenance worker, the canteen owner as well as three newspaper vendors.
The robbers stole a lorry used by the newspaper vendor and a Toyota Camry which belonged to the school canteen owner.
The four fled at about 6am. Other staff members who arrived at the school shortly afterwards discovered the tied-up victims and alerted the police.
"It is indeed puzzling why the robbers were at the crime scene for almost four hours," said Supt Tan.
All the victims were tied up and were unharmed while the robber with the parang kept an eye on them.
Supt Tan said the safe which contained the cash was hidden within a closet in the teacher's room, adding that it was likely the robbers had prior knowledge of the whereabouts of the safe.
"We will definitely investigate all angles and do not rule out the possibility of an inside job," he said.
Supt Tan said the school was equipped with numerous closed circuit cameras and hoped the footage could help shed light on the identity of the robbers.
