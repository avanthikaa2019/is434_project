Singapore's aspiring young actresses will have the opportunity to audition for the roles of the orphans in the forthcoming UK production of the musical Annie.
The musical opens at the Sands Theater, Marina Bay Sands, on July 10, 2012.
Auditions will take place on June 2 and 3.
The producers are looking for girls aged six to 14 who can sing, dance and act to register their interest by downloading the form from www.baseentertainmentasia.com/annie and emailing Anniethemusical@srt.com.sg by May 27.
The show's director and choreographer Roger Hannah, will be flying from the UK to Singapore for the auditions, and will be looking for three sets of nine orphans - the small and cute Molly, the 'Tom-boy' characters Pepper and July, as well as Kate, Duffy, Violet, Eleanor, Rosie and Becky.
Each character must be no taller than than 5'2" or 157cm.
The role of Annie will be played in rotation by three UK-based children who will tour with the production.
Annie has become one of the best-loved family musicals of all time.
The show boasts one of Broadway's most memorable scores, with the orphans performing some of the best tunes including It's The Hard Knock Life, You're Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile and A New Deal for Christmas.
