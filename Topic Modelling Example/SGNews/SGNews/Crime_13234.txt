Ko Young-wook has denied allegations that he intentionally got an 18-year-old female entertainer-aspirant drunk to rape her at his home.
The former member of K-pop group Roo'Ra was under police investigation on Wednesday morning, after the alleged victim sued Ko for rape.
"I am wondering why the accuser sued me, even though she knows the entire truth," Ko said in a statement on his management agency's website.
"I cannot reveal every detail of the situation to the public but I want to make it clear that I'm not as immoral as depicted in the media," he said.
According to the police, Ko obtained the victim's contact number through a cable TV program official after he saw her on a pre-recorded video of the program and thought she was his type.
He enticed her by saying in the phone call that he would help her become a celebrity. Then, he picked her up in his car, drove home, encouraged her to drink and raped her, the police said.
Ko reportedly admitted having sexual intercourse but said it was done under mutual consent without knowing that she was a minor.
The police sought an arrest warrant for Ko, on charges of rape of a minor.
