Given the difficult political atmosphere, perhaps Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda feels he can relate to Britain's "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher.
In an interview with The Washington Post published Thursday, Noda said he loved watching movies and is a fan of Meryl Streep, who recently won an Academy Award for her portrayal of the former British prime minister in "The Iron Lady."
The movie, released last month in Japan, follows Thatcher's life and career as she pushed through a series of economic and administrative reforms despite opposition from her countrymen.
Noda also said one of his favorite movies is the 1939 film "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," which tells the story of a US senator who single-handedly fights against political corruption.
Noda's remarks were in response to a question about his hobbies after the paper's reporter commented that many Americans did not know much about him aside from his humble nature.
During the interview, Noda spoke about his controversial policy initiatives, such as raising the consumption tax rate and restarting idled nuclear reactors. "We are at the point to make tough decisions," he said. In talking about his difficulties, Noda appears to have likened himself to Thatcher.
