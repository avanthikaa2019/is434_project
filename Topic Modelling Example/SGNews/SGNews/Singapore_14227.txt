In recent years, the flow of blue collar workers from the Malaysian tap has slowed to a drip, due to a booming economy across the Causeway combined with the rising cost of living here.
Companies across various sectors like retail, food and beverage and manufacturing told The Business Times they are having trouble finding workers from Malaysia, a traditional source country, to fill low-end positions.
In construction, Malaysian unskilled labour stopped coming five to 10 years ago. But in recent years it has been harder to find Thai, mainland Chinese and Indian workers. Low wages, the high cost of living here and better prospects in the workers' home countries have all played a part in this trend.
National University of Singapore labour economist Shandre Thangavelu said Singapore can look for alternative sources of low-wage labour from countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
