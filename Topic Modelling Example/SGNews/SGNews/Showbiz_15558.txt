AMY Winehouse's best friend and former lover, Tyler James, appeared on the British version of The Voice last Saturday. He sang Otis Redding's Dock Of The Bay during the blind auditions, winning judge Will.i.am's vote.
James said in an interview with British newspaper The Daily Mirror that "I think she'd be surprised I'm on something like this, but I think she'd be pleased".
