A British man effectively 'ratted on' himself after he wrote a Facebook message during a trial that he may 'get away with' his assault crime, according to news reports.
Michael Ruse, 21-year-old charged for attacking a friend's father, posted a status update as the jury were preparing their verdict, saying "Yeah, I think I get away with it tbh (to be honest) x."
Unfortunately for the over-confident Ruse, the exchange was printed and delivered anonymously to the Portsmouth Crown Court where he was being tried.
"You were stupid enough to put on Facebook what amounted to a full confession," judge said to Ruse.
In the light of the 'new-found evidence', the accused admitted the charges and received a 46-week suspended prison sentence.
Russell Pyne, who was representing Ruse, said his client "needs help with regards to thinking skills."
