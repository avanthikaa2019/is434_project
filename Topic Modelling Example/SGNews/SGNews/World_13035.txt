WELLINGTON - Three American students from Boston University were killed when their van crashed near Tongariro National Park in New Zealand's central North Island, police said Sunday.
Another three were in hospital with one in a serious condition.
The students, who were taking courses at Auckland University, were among a group of 16 who had gone away in two vans for a hiking weekend.
They were near the start of the popular Tongariro Crossing walk when one van rolled over on Saturday.
Road policing manager Kevin Taylor said the cause of the accident was under investigation.
Another five American students had to be rescued from the Tongariro Crossing when they became trapped in icy conditions on the side of a mountain.
A rescue helicopter crew found the group huddled together near the mountain summit at dusk on Saturday.
