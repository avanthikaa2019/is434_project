MANCHESTER - Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson left controversial winger Ashley Young on the bench for the Premier League leaders' match against Everton at Old Trafford here on Sunday.
He was replaced by Nani, the Portuguese winger making his first start since early March, in the only change to the team that beat Aston Villa 4-0 last week in a match where Young won a hotly debated penalty that led to the opening goal.
It followed a similarly debatable penalty decision won by Young in a win over QPR a week earlier and the United player's ability to stay on his feet - or not - in the opposition penalty area has become a subject of national debate.
"I've had a word with Ashley," Ferguson said Friday. "He understands where we come from and hopefully it makes a difference.
"The first thing you have to say about last week's incident is that if the player doesn't bring him down he's going to score.
"It's a clear goal-scoring opportunity. He caught him, though he did overdo the attempt to get a penalty kick.
"I'm not sure he actually tried to get a penalty kick but he certainly went down quickly."
Victory for United would mean they could retain their Premier League title at arch local rivals Manchester City a week on Monday.
Second-placed City, currently five points behind United, are in action later Sunday away to bottom of the table Wolves.
