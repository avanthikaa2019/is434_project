WASHINGTON - Two Taiwanese citizens have been charged with trying to export sensitive US military technology to China, the FBI said.
The two suspects, Hui Sheng Shen, 45, and Huan Ling Chang, 41, were arrested in February and initially charged with trying to smuggle methamphetamine through a New Jersey port. The arms smuggling charges were added Wednesday.
The two are accused of asking undercover FBI agents to help them obtain military hardware to send to China, including drones, E-2C Hawkeye surveillance planes and stealth technology used for F-22 fighters.
Undercover agents posing as arms smugglers gathered evidence against Shen and Chang during meetings and recorded phone conversations.
In some of the conversations, Shen and Chang allegedly said their associates worked for a Chinese intelligence agency and would use government money to make the purchases, the FBI said.
The drug charges carry a minimum mandatory penalty of 10 years in jail and a maximum potential penalty of life in prison. The arms smuggling violations would carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
