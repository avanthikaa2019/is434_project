English-language weekly tabla! is setting out to engage the Indian community on several new platforms.
The weekly for the Indian community in Singapore plans to promote greater integration among various segments of Singapore's Indian community, and also play a bigger part in community festivals such as Deepavali.
As a start, tabla! is presenting the Taj Express, a Bollywood musical that is making its world premiere here in Singapore, on June 7.
Said Mr S. Chandra Das, chairman of Tamil Murasu, which publishes tabla!: "This association with Taj Express signals the start of the next phase for tabla!.
"Having firmly established itself in the community, it's time for the newspaper to engage its readers in new ways. Presenting a top quality musical like Taj Express is just one of them."
The Taj Express is a musical journey through kaleidoscopic India.
tabla!, is read by over 120,000 people every week.It marked its third anniversary last October with the launch of the tabla! Community Champion Award.
