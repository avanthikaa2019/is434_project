SEOUL - The very mention of the name Jason Mraz whips his fans up into a frenzy.
There's good news for those heading to Gardens By The Bay for his June 29 concert - the man will be performing new songs with his new band.
The singer played concerts in Busan and on Nami Island last weekend. He said at a press conference in Seoul last Friday that "we brought new songs, meaningful melodies and messages just to continue to spread the love for music".
And Mraz is earthier than ever.
At his press conference in Seoul, he turned up barefoot, clad in a pair of plain jeans and a T-shirt with a print of a poem about what he loves about himself.
He recently appeared in last month's issue of Yoga Journal, speaking on how yoga and a down-to-earth lifestyle have influenced his recent work.
Mraz will be in Singapore in support of his latest album, Love Is A Four Letter Word, released in April.
And, today, he's more confident than ever of his music.
"I would like to think that I'm a more seasoned performer. I came with a new band, new songs and big sound," he said.
He added that he believes that music can change one's life - that is what keeps him singing and writing music.
He said: "When someone says something, or speaks a word or a phrase that is intended to change or inspire, it might possibly be forgotten, whereas when that phrase or word is applied to music or melody, it is not only heard, but also felt.
"And, when something is felt, I believe that it changes your DNA and your attitude in life.
"When I was a young man, I used music as my companion. Whenever I was sad, I listened to sad songs and I knew that I wasn't alone.
"I knew that in those experiences, I was being changed. Music can change you."
All tickets to Jason Mraz - Tour Is A Four Letter Word at The Meadow, Gardens By The Bay are sold out.
