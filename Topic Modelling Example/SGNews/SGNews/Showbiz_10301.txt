Indian superstar Rajnikanth's blockbuster movie Robot was released to overwhelming response in Japan recently.
Makkal Osai reported that Japanese movie-goers love Rajnikanth's films and he is well known there through his earlier film Muthu.
Robot is a dubbed version of the Tamil movie titled Endhiran. It was simultaneously released in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil last year.
In the movie, Rajnikanth plays two roles a scientist and the robot that he develops.
To suit the Japanese market, the film was edited to two hours, but due to the unexpected response, the original three-hour film is now being screened at over 1,300 cinemas in the country.
It is competing with the mainstream Japanese films and its songs Irumbile and Naina Miley have become a huge hit among young Japanese despite the language divide.
