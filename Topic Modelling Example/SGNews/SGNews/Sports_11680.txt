Manchester United, with a following of 659 million fans, has been named the world's most popular club.
The club ranked number one in a survey carried out by leading market research agency, Kantar, with 54,000 respondents from 39 countries.
Forbes recently named Manchester United the most valuable football team in world, ahead of Real Madrid and Barcelona.
The Red Devils, worth US$2.24 billion (S$2.87 billion) according to Forbes, has been at the top of the list every year since Forbes began calculating valuations for the world sport.
With 1.6 billion followers globally, Kantar also found that football remains the world's most popular sport, a finding that is congruous with the results of a recent FIFA survey.
Richard Arnold, the Club's Commercial Director, explained the reason behind the club's popularity:
"Manchester United has built on a tradition of iconic players, iconic teams and iconic achievements - Beckham, Busby, Benfica '68. Now our games are broadcast to 1.15 billion households globally, to an audience of over four billion a year. Manchester United resonates with followers all over the world, and it's their passion and support that means year after year we can continue doing what matters most to everyone at the Club: playing attacking football and competing for trophies."
