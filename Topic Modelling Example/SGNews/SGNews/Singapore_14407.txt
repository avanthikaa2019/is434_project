A former prisoner has made good in the restaurant business in Singapore and is now helping other former convicts as well.
China Press reported that Benny Se Teo has been hiring former convicts to work at his three Eighteen Chefs restaurants in the island republic.
Se Teo, 52, was once a drug addict who had been jailed four times for drug-related offences.
He decided to work on his own after being rejected six times in job applications after his last release from prison in 1993.
He also wanted to give former prisoners a new lease in life.
So he started the Eighteen Chefs in 2007, providing them jobs and training them to become chefs and waiters.
About 35% of his staff members are for- mer convicts.
One of his workers. who was previously jailed for drunk-driving, was hired as a waiter four years ago after his release, with a monthly pay of S$1,200 (RM2,880).
He was later promoted to be a supervisor with a pay of S$2,500 (RM6,000). Eventually, he became its regional general manager, earning S$6,000 (RM14,400) a month.
