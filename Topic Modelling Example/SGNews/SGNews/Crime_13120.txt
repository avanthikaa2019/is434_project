The last of four men, who arranged for 54 stolen Malaysian-registered cars to be shipped to Batam in 2003, was sentenced to 4 1/2-years jail on Friday.
Ng Chong How, 47, had worked with three accomplices to move the mostly top-end Japanese cars from Malaysia between Aug and Nov 2003, reported The Straits Times.
Ng pleaded guilty on Wednesday to five charges of receiving and disposing of stolen property, reported The Straits Times.
The district court was told that Ng had been previously charged, but due to insufficient evidence, he was subsequently discharged in March 2004.
In June 2004, his accomplices were prosecuted and sentenced with jail terms.
The Straits Times reported that police had gathered sufficient evidence then and charges against Ng were resurrected. However, he had already moved Batam to start a computer business and had married an Indonesian woman.
Ng's defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary said that Ng was living in Batam due to the lower cost of living, and was not avoiding the authorities. Mr Tiwary also added that his client returned to Singapore when he found out late last year that the police were looking for him.
Court documents state that Ng and the three men had worked together to receive 54 containers, each carrying a car, and move them to the island of Batam in Indonesia.
Singapore police had checked a container at PSA Port after receiving information from their Malaysian counterparts in Nov 2003. They later arrested the four men.
