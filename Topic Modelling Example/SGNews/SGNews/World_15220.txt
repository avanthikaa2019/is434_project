WASHINGTON - The United States issued a travel warning Friday for Guinea-Bissau after a coup in the African nation, urging American citizens "to shelter in place and avoid the downtown area of Bissau."
A statement from the State Department said it "has received reports of explosions and heavy weapons fire in Guinea-Bissau's capital city" and cited a "threat of continued violence and an increased potential for political instability and civil or military unrest."
