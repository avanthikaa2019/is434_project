A secondary school teacher who had pleaded guilty to caning her maid three times was given two years' probation on Monday.
54-year-old Lee Meng Choo, a teacher at Junyuan Secondary School, had pleaded guilty in April to abusing her maid.
The Straits Times reported that she had caned her Indonesian maid, Ms Sri Maryati, 24, on the buttocks, back and hands for not checking on Lee's 11-year-old son's homework and setting the alarm clock wrongly.
She also pulled the maid's ear until it bled for clogging up the kitchen sink, said the paper.
Ms Sri sought help from a neighbour's maid, and the neighbour subsequently brought her to the police.
Lee, who suffers from a form of chronic depression called dysthymia, was found suitable for probation by the district court.
Apart from probation, Lee was ordered to pay Ms Sri $10,950 as loss of earnings since August 2009.
She also agreed to go for follow-up psychiatric and psychological treatment.
Lee's husband signed a $5,000 bond to ensure her good behaviour in the next two years. She is currently on leave and will return to work after a psychological examination finds her fit for duty.
