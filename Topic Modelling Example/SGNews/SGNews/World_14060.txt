LONDON - British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday paid tribute to the kidnapped British Red Cross worker found dead in Pakistan, calling his murder a "shocking and merciless act".
Cameron said he "was deeply saddened" to hear about the death of Khalil Dale, and accused the attackers of having "no respect for human life and the rule of law."
"This was a shocking and merciless act," added the leader.
"Khalil Dale has dedicated many years of his life to helping some of the most vulnerable people in the world and my thoughts today are with his friends and family," he said in a statement.
London had tried tirelessly to secure the release of the 60-year-old since his kidnapping in Baluchistan province in January, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in an earlier statement.
"This was a senseless and cruel act, targeting someone whose role was to help the people of Pakistan, and causing immeasurable pain to those who knew Mr Dale," said Hague.
The Red Cross announced earlier Sunday that Dale, a health programme manager, had been found dead in Quetta, Pakistan, four months after he was abducted by armed men.
