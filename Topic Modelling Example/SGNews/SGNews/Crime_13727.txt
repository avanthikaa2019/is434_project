Two Traffic Police officers rejected a bribe offered by a 31-year-old man who is suspected of drink driving.
When Sgt Fadli Shaifuddin Bin Mohamed Sani and Cpl Ng Ching Heng responded to a call yesterday at about 6am, they found a white car parked in the middle lane of the slip road exiting the Pan Island Expressway, towards Bukit Batok Road.
Upon arrival, the police officers found the male driver sleeping in the driver's seat of the car.
After waking the driver up, the officers proceeded to conduct a breathalyser test on him as he reeked of alcohol.
While the test was being administered, the driver offered $80 cash to the officers and pleaded with them to let him off.
Both officers immediately rejected the bribe and arrested him for suspected drink driving and attempted bribery.
