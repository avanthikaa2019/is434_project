When American glam-rock band Scissor Sisters disco-danced their way onto the mainstream scene with their eponymous second album in 2004, they set millions a-boogieing.
Making hits of songs - like their electro version of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb and Take Your Mama - the New York outfit's music was extremely dancefloor-worthy.
Soon after, indie British electronic band Hot Chip remixed the latter tune, and made it even more infectious. (Seriously, if you've yet to hear it, YouTube is your friend.)
Years later, neither act has lost that inimitable knack for getting people moving.
The Sisters' fourth full length effort, Magic Hour, which comes after 2010's Night Works, does not by any means purport to be a perfect record - it's a mixed bag that isn't all danceable.
Indeed, ballads like 1980s throwback Year Of Living Dangerously may not appeal to everyone, as unapologetically melodramatic as they are.
Perhaps the addition of "It" producers like Calvin Harris has distracted the band - comprising ever-fabulous vocalists Ana Matronic and Jake Shears; multi- instrumentalist Babydaddy; guitarist/bassist Del Marquis; and drummer Randy Real - from their original sound.
But, when they do get back to business, the irresistible pop hooks are aplenty.
Perky opening jam Baby Come Home, for instance, recalls the Bee Gees, while Let's Have A Kiki is a hedonistic, glittery electroclash gem.
Unlike the Scissor Sisters' album, In Our Heads - the self-produced fifth album by Hot Chip, which will play a show at Avalon next Tuesday - doesn't stray too far from home.
This record maintains the groovy synthesiser beats and hypnotic percussion that gained them critical acclaim and keep the danceability factor high on tracks like How Do You Do?
There are clear echoes of I Feel Better (from 2010) on Let Me Be Him, for example - but hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Now, let's get boogie-ing!
