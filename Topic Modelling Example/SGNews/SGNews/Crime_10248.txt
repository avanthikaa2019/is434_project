Five teenagers were arrested yesterday for theft of bicycles.
The teens, aged between 14 to 17 years old, were spotted behaving suspiciously by two off-duty police officers at a little past 1am on June 15 in the void deck of Blk 656 Woodlands Ring Road.
When the on-duty officers from Jurong Police Division responded to their call for back-up, they conducted a check on the suspects and found three bicycles, believed to be stolen, in their possession. They were subsequently arrested for theft.
Investigations into the case are ongoing. Anyone convicted of Theft with Common Intention under Section 379 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 shall be liable for a fine, imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or both.
