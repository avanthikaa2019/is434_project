You can now have someone whip out a handphone, film and edit an entire music video of you and send it to MTV&hellip;. especially if you're Yuna.
Yuna's latest music video, Sparkle, was shot and edited on a humble handphone - a Samsung Galaxy note, to be precise.
An SLR camera may have been used for framing purposes but still, it was all done on Samsung's new baby.
"It took a day to shoot the video and a couple of months to edit it, to get the animation right," says the music-video director Quek Shia Chuan.
The animation was created using digital illustrations submitted by the fans via the www.sparkle.my website.
"A total of 3,500 illustrations were received but we chose the best 60," adds Quek.
Yuna says, "I'm very happy with the results. The best thing about creating this video was I got to interact with my fans. It just goes to show how creative people out there are."
The piece-de-resistance, which the director claims will be shown on MTV, can be seen here.
The Sparkle project was a creative partnership between Yuna and Samsung Malaysia Electronics.
The premiere of the video was held at the Delicious restaurant in Kuala Lumpur.
