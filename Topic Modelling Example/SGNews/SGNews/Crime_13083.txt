JOHOR BARU - Police caught two robbers who were high on drugs after an 8km car chase.
They nabbed the duo at 3.30pm on Thursday and recovered several stolen items from the suspects.
The drama unfolded in Taman Nusa Bestari when the duo, who operated using a one-tonne lorry, attempted to break into a house in the area.
Nusajaya OCPD Supt Noor Hashim Mohamed said they received a police report from the houseowner and alerted all nearby police units.
"In half an hour, a police MPV managed to locate the lorry along Jalan Bakti, Taman Mutiara Rini and gave chase," he said here yesterday.
He said that they found a 32" LCD television, a can containing drug-sniffing paraphernalia, a laptop, parang, cleaver, wire cutters and crowbars.
"Initial investigations revealed the duo were also involved in a robbery in another house before attempting to break into the second house," he said, adding that the suspects tested positive for heroin.
"We believe that both men were from a gang that has been active in the Nusajaya area for four months, and were linked to nine cases so far.
"Their modus operandi was to target empty houses and cut the auto gate wire while an accomplice would wait outside and load the loot into the lorry," added Supt Noor Hashim.
He said the suspects were being investigated under Section 457 of the Penal Code for housebreaking and Section 448 of the Penal Code for trespassing.
