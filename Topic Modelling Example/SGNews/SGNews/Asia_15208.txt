Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra kicked off Songkran celebrations in her home province of Chiang Mai yesterday by presiding over a special ceremony at Tha Phae Gate at 7am.
In her speech, Yingluck cited Buddha's teachings and the nobility of Their Majesties the King and Queen as she wished everybody a happy Songkran. She also called on Thai people to unite, forgive and love one another.
"May this year be full of love, forgiveness and reconciliation in Thailand," she said.
Later, Yingluck and her older sister, Yaowapa Wongsawat, then headed for their home district of San Kamphaeng to pay respects to their ancestors at the Rong Tham Samakkhit Temple, where they were greeted by many red-shirt supporters.
Opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, meanwhile, wished everybody a very happy Songkran and urged one and all to be mindful and safe.
