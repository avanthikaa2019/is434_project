CANNES, France - Brad Pitt on Tuesday scotched rumours that his wedding to the other half of Hollywood's hottest couple, Angelina Jolie, would take place in August.
Pitt also said his partner would not join him on the red carpet in Cannes later Tuesday for the premiere of the blood-drenched drama "Killing Them Softly" in which he stars as a hit man.
"She's not here right now. She's prepping for a movie that starts pretty soon," the 48-year-old actor, sporting shaggy blond-tinted hair and a goatee, told reporters after a press screening of Andrew Dominik's movie.
Asked if he planned to act in another film alongside 36-year-old Jolie, he replied: "Actually, I'd love to." "We actually really, truly have no date" for the wedding that the couple announced in April and which will come after six children and years of unwedded coupledom, he said.
Pitt and Jolie became close on the set of 2005 film "Mr. and Mrs. Smith." They have three biological children together and adopted three others.
Pitt's new film features him as a contract killer working for a mob syndicate run like any major US corporation, complete with brutal cost-cutting to cope with the recession.
"Killing Them Softly" is one of 22 films vying for the festival's coveted Palme d'Or top prize, to be awarded on Sunday.
