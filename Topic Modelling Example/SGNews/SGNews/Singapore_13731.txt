A university student, Natasha Wan Xue Wen attacked four police officers after going to the Zouk dance club.
Wan, 24, pleaded guilty to using criminal force and abusive words on public servants, and behaving in disorderly manner.
At about 4am on October 26 last year, two policemen saw a bouncer escorting Wan, her boyfriend Lim Zhao Ming, and another man out of Zouk.
Mr Lim had a cut, and bloodstains on his shirt. The two officers asked if he had been assaulted, and if he needed medical treatment.
Mr Lim shouted at the policemen, and Wan suddenly punched an officer in the face and began hurling vulgarities.
When two female police officers arrived to arrest Wan, she put up a struggle.
On the way to the police station, Wan head-butted one of the female officers and bit the other on the wrist and hand.
The officer who was bitten had to be warded in hospital for six days and given 13 days' medical leave.
Wan's lawyer said she was suffering from stress when she committed the offences. A test showed that her blood-alcohol level was 172mg per 100ml of blood - more than twice the 80mg level for drink driving.
The next hearing will be on June 7.
