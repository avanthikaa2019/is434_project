The 2.30pm incident on Sunday occurred in Semenyih when the victim was on her way home from a sundry shop with another girl.
The man, who was riding a motorcycle with a friend, asked if she knew where one of her neighbours stayed.
After the girl had pointed out where, they went to the house but the neighbour was not in.
The girl offered to ride with the man and look for the neighbour while his friend stayed with the other girl.
The man then took her to an empty house and raped her.
She complained to her father, who lodged a police report.
Kajang OCPD ACP Abdul Rashid Abdul Wahab said the man, who was acquainted with the victim's father, was arrested.
