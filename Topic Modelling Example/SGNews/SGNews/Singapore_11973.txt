SINGAPORE - A heavy thunderstorm last night toppled trees and flooded roads all over Singapore.
According to an AsiaOne reader, the wind was so strong that the roads were littered with dangerous debris such as branches and the rain was coming down at an angle.
Stomp contributor Stanley wrote in to say that his car was next to an unfortunate cab that got dented by a falling tree.
"When I woke up this morning, I was shocked to see the back of the taxi was seriously damaged," he said, adding that the tree had been removed by the time he noticed the destruction.
He said the back screen of the taxi was shattered, but nobody was injured.
"I count myself fortunate as my car was just next to the taxi," he said.
Toppled trees were also spotted at Clementi and Hillview Road, where the tree at Clementi Avenue 2 fell on a parked car.
Stomp contributor Christinee who spotted the fallen tree at Hillview Road expressed surprise that such a "heavy big tree can actually fall so easily just because of the wind."
"It's lucky that no accidents were caused or anyone injured," she said.
The brief but heavy half-hour downpour also caused flood water to pool at the junction of Admiralty Road and Marsiling Drive early this morning.
According to an eye-witness, the water was at almost knee-level.
At about 6am this morning, the National Environmental Agency issued a warning of heavy rain ahead.
