A tour coach driver has been arrested for drink driving after driving a bus onto the pedestrian walkway at Changi Airport's Terminal 3.
The driver is believed to have dozed off at the wheel.
The bus was empty, and did not hit anyone when the incident occurred at 7am yesterday.
According to The Straits Times, a police spokesman said the 48-year-old Singaporean driver mounted a kerb outside the departure hall.
An eyewitness said that the bus mounted the pavement and drove on it for a distance without slowing down.
Airport security guards shouted, and banged on the side of the bus to attract the driver's attention.
The driver appeared agitated after he pulled to a stop, and was seen shouting at the security guards and chain-smoking.
Police investigations are ongoing.
