DONETSK, Ukraine - France coach Laurent Blanc said Saturday he was not worried by a thigh niggle that had forced him to take off impressive midfielder Yohan Cabaye during the 2-0 win over co-hosts Ukraine in their Euro 2012 clash on Friday.
Cabaye, who has maintained his excellent club form for English Premier League side Newcastle at the championship, scored the second of France's goals and also hit a post as the French took a big step towards the last eight.
However, Cabaye, a Ligue 1 winner with Lille in 2011 before moving to Newcastle, was taken off in the 68th minute after he felt the same twinge he had done prior to the game.
"I am not worried but we have to be aware of it," said Blanc at a press conference.
"He had felt a little twinge behind his thigh in training, and he felt it again during the match. He then thought it best not to push his luck."
Cabaye's goal - which prompted him to think immediately of his young daughter - and one from the equally impressive winger Jeremy Menez saw France leapfrog Ukraine in the table onto four points.
They were later joined by England after they beat Sweden 3-2, ending the Scandinavian side's chances of reaching the quarter-finals.
France round off their group games against the Swedes on Tuesday while England play Ukraine.
