A successful initiative to promote healthy living among low-income families in the Admiralty area will see the programme expand to more constituencies in the next three years.
The "Healthy Head Start" programme of the Health Promotion Board (HPB), run in partnership with grassroots organisations and self-help groups, aims to equip disadvantaged families with young children with the skills to create a sustainable health promoting environment at home.
The pilot, which involved 17 families initially, will now reach out to 250 in Admiralty, and about 5,000 low-income homes island-wide by 2015.
