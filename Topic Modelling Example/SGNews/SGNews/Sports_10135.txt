Footballer Muhamad Nazmi Faiz Mansor, who recently signed a lucrative contract with Portuguese Division One club SC Biera-Mar, said he was not a playboy.
His statement came following several Internet postings that linked him to several young girls.
"I do not want to entertain any gossip or controversy implicating me. People can say anything they want but only I know the truth," Metro Ahad reported him as saying.
The tabloid conducted a search and two names Tengku F and N kept popping up on a social networking site.
Another girl, who posted her name only as T, is said to be madly in love with the footballer.
Not denying that he knew some of the girls who had posed with him, Muhamad Nazmi refuted suggestions that he had any romantic links with any of them.
Met by the paper at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya, the 17-year-old, who is known to his fans as Nami, said he need not explain his status with the girls as it was personal.
"I do not know why their pictures with me are circulating on the Internet and what the objective is," said the young star from Lembah Keramat, Kuala Lumpur.
In a related development, actress Noor Neelofa Mohd Noor also refuted gossip that Tengku F is related to her.
In defence of his son, Muhamad Nazmi's father Mansor Mustapha said the boy was going through adolescence.
