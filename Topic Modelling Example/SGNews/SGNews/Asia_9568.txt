HA NOI - National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Sinh Hung yesterday proposed that Viet Nam and Myanmar strengthen links in economics, trade, investment, socio-cultural affairs and legislative activities. Hung held talks with the visiting Speaker of Myanmar's Upper House, and the President of Myanmar's Parliament, Khin Aung Myint, in Ha Noi.
Hung highlighted the achievements recorded by the Myanmar people in socio-political stability and economic development, as well as the country's role in the region and international arena.
Myanmar's top legislator said his visit also aimed to further relations between Myanmar's Upper House and Viet Nam's National Assembly.
Myint said he hoped both NAs would work closely together on external relations.
The two sides agreed to increase exchanges at all levels, especially senior-level delegations. They will also set up a parliamentary friendship group and increase co-operation between the offices of both legislative bodies.
They also agreed to continue supporting each other at multilateral forums to lay a firm foundation for other links.
Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and President Truong Tan Sang also welcomed the top Myanmar lawmaker yesterday.
Trong said he hoped Myanmar would gain more achievements in its democratisation, open-door policy and reforms.
President Sang also spoke highly of the achievements the Myanmar people had made, especially in organising the parliamentary by-elections in April.
He also suggested that both states step up co-operation at regional and international forums.
Sang said he believed that Myanmar would successfully carry out its duties when it takes over the ASEAN Chair in 2014.
Khin Aung Myint praised the positive changes in Viet Nam in recent years, saying he was sure Viet Nam would maintain a healthy macro economy and social welfare.
