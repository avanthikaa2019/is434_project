SINGAPORE - Tension was high outside the Subordinate Courts today as supporters of the City Harvest Church leaders formed a human wall to shield them from the media.
More than 200 people turned up to support City Harvest founder Kong Hee and four other church members as they faced charges for the alleged misuse of church funds.
According to Lianhe Wanbao, media personnel complained of being pushed and obstructed aggressively when they tried to take pictures of the accused walking out of court.
The paper reported that 20 people formed a human wall around the accused members as they walked out of court.
A female photojournalist was overheard yelling, "Why did you push me? I am a woman!".
Shin Min Daily News reported that many supporters were agitated, some were even seen crying outside of court.
Another videographer was also seen arguing with a supporter when the supporter relentlessly waved his hand in front of the camera to prevent him from capturing scenes of Kong Hee walking out of court.
The cameraman told Lianhe Wanbao that the argument started when he asked the man not to block his camera. The supporter then retorted that there was nothing wrong in putting his hands up.
"Even if he wanted to protect the leaders, he should not prevent us from doing our jobs," the cameraman said.
