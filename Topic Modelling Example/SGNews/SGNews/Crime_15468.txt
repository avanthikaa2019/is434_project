KUALA LUMPUR - Seven people are upset with a trickster woman who allegedly cheated them of several thousand ringgit and one of them is her own daughter.
Also claiming to be a victim is the woman's second husband, who joined his stepdaughter at a press conference to expose the rip-offs.
The 19-year-old daughter claimed her mother cheated others by posing as a bomoh who could eliminate bad luck.
She spoke at a press conference organised by the MCA Public Services and Complaints Department at Wisma MCA yesterday.
She was among the seven who had lost a total of about RM30,000 (S$12,318) in cash and jewellery to her mother.
The daughter said her mother told the victims she could ward off evil if they surrendered their valuables to be used in a cleansing ritual.
"My relationship with her turned sour after my husband refused to become a guarantor when she wanted to apply for a RM50,000 loan.
"She also cheated my in-laws of RM5,000," she said.
The woman's husband, meanwhile, said he had filed for divorce after finding out about the cheating cases.
"We were together for seven years and she has stolen RM9,000 from me. She has taken my passport as well," said the Pakistani national.
Bank officer Suzana Mohamad, 31, claimed she was also cheated of RM9,000 and related how the woman distressed her by predicting that terrible tragedies would befall her family.
"She said I needed to hand her all my valuables so that she could conduct a ritual. She also told me not to tell anyone," said Suzana.
Department head Datuk Seri Michael Chong said many people still fell for the trick.
"This is because Malaysians are too superstitious. Last year, we had five similar cases involving RM160,000 while in 2009 we had 12 cases involving RM800,000," he said, adding that four people had lodged police reports against the woman.
