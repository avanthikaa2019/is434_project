Faymond Huang Zhiming, former events manager of 101 Hair Consultants, was fined $25,000 in total on Monday for corruption.
The 38-year-old was ordered to pay $10,200 in penalty, equivalent to the total amount of bribes he accepted from two people to rent commercial spaces from them, reported The Straits Times.
He was given two charges for receiving $1,300 and $1,500 from Mr Teo Kah Siong, who owns JR Concept Enterprise.
He also received two other charges for getting $3,500 and $1,400 from Ms Seah Sok Hong, a director of Hemus Pacific, as rewards to rent commercial space from the companies for 101 Hair Consultants.
Huang pleaded guilty to all four charges.
Both firms were in the business of renting open commercial spaces at shopping centres and letting them to companies to do roadshows.
The court heard that Huang's job was to source for commercial spaces at shopping mall, MRT stations and intercharges to stage roadshows.
He was also in-charge of handling the logistics for such shows for 101 Hair Consultants and its related companies.
In 2008, an agreement between Huang and Ms Seah and Mr Teo was made. In which, he would accept a fee of $100 a day for each day that 101 Hair Consultants rented commercial spaces through their companies.
Taken into consideration during his sentencing were five other similar charges.
Huang, now a marketing manager of a local company, could have been fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed up to five years on each charge for bribery.
