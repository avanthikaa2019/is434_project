Members and supporters of the Workers' Party (WP) were not the only ones in a celebratory mood after the results of last Saturday's by-election were announced.
Mr Yeo Kok Peng, 46, manager of YSL Coffee House, situated in Block 322, Hougang Avenue 5, was just as ecstatic.
This was after business at the 24-hour eatery surged last Saturday, thanks to the hundreds of WP supporters who made it their "base". Mr Yeo said: "I think (the crowds came) because we're across the road which leads to Holy Innocents' Primary School." The school was one of two counting centres in the by-election.
He said that drink sales over the past few days increased by an estimated 5 to 10 per cent.
Sales peaked last Saturday, increasing by 20 to 30 per cent, compared to regular days. It accounted for an increase of about $400 in earnings that day.
