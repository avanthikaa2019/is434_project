Last year, David Letterman put Harry Potter actress Emma Watson on the spot about her drinking habits. Now, it's Justin Bieber's turn to be in the hot seat.
The Canadian pop star, 18, was showing off his new tattoo to the veteran TV host.
After a series of terse questions about the need for body art, Letterman grabbed Bieber and tried to scrub the ink from his arm.
Letterman later apologised to the teen idol for being "snappish".
To which the teenager graciously replied: "Everything's great. It's all good. You're fine. Don't worry."
