PHNOM PENH - Mounting cyber security threats need immediate attention from Asean countries, said Defence Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi here yesterday.
"Studies show that losses incurred from cyber security crimes amounted to a staggering RM388 billion (S$158 million) worldwide last year.
"Thus, it is crucial for us to work together in restraining threats like these, for the sake of peace and stability of our region," he said at the 6th Asean Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM). here yesterday.
While acknowledging that recent developments in the South China Sea were cause for concern, Zahid said the parties concerned should abide by the Declaration of Conduct when dealing with the matter.
"It is important for all parties to practise restraint to avoid escalating the tension.
"The highest level of diplomacy is paramount here," he added.
Among the outcomes achieved at the 6th ADMM were the Cambodian initiative on the establishment of the Asean Civil War Free Zone and the possibility of developing an Asean Master Plan of Security Connectivity.
