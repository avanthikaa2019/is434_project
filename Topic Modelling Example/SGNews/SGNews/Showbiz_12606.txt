MANILA - At a rally calling for Lady Gaga to cancel her shows in Manila next week, about 70 Christian youths in the Philippines chanted "Stop the Lady Gaga concerts".
On Friday, members of the group called Biblemode Youth Philippines said that they are offended by Lady Gaga's music and videos. They say that she mocks Jesus Christ in her song "Judas", reported the Associated Press.
Ben Abante, former Philippine Congressman, led the protest, saying his group will file a case against the singer as well as concert organisers if she sings Judas next week.
For offending race and religion, the singer and organisers can be punished, added Former Manila Mayor Jose Atienza.
Prior to this, Lady Gaga had cancelled a concert in Jakarta following protests from conservative Muslims.
