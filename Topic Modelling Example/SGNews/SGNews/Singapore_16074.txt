A new online guide is now available for gamblers who have mild addiction problems, and those with more severe problems but are not willing to seek treatment.
The guide, which will be targeted at problem gamblers and their family members, was launched by the Institute of Mental Health's National Addictions Management Service (NAMS). An interactive workbook will help gamblers recognise problem behaviours such as the triggers for gambling and their distorted beliefs. It will also include information on how to develop strategies to say 'no' to gambling opportunities.
The NAMS saw a 27 per cent jump in the number of gambling addiction cases in from 2010 to March 31, 2011. Gambling is the third most common addiction after drug and alcohol addiction.
Another outreach programme, called Families in Recovery through Education and Empowerment (FREE), started in May 2010, also families of problem gamblers by trying to intervene in the gambler's addiction problems. Sessions are conducted in English and Mandarin by a trained counsellor.
195 participants attended the sessions so far, which ended in January 2012.
