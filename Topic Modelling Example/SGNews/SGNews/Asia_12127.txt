TAIPEI - Taiwan's unmarried women were up in arms Thursday over the education ministry's online dictionary, which defines a &ldquo;good woman&rdquo; as one who focuses on her family life and adores her husband.
Several women lawmakers slammed the ministry for being biased against unwed women and promoting chauvinistic attitudes.
&ldquo;The characteristic of a new good woman is to focus her life on her family, adore her husband, look after her children and do her best to maintain a happy and harmonious marriage,&rdquo; the dictionary states.
Lawmaker Lo Shu-lei, who is single, said the ministry &ldquo;doesn't know which year we are&rdquo; and &ldquo;discriminates against unmarried women", adding that a good woman should be defined as &ldquo;confident, hard-working and independent&rdquo;.
Unmarried lawmaker Chen Ting-fei said: &ldquo;This is male chauvinism and feudalistic thinking. I am in a bad mood, because I have become a bad woman since I don't have a husband to adore and children to take care of.&rdquo;
The ministry promised to respect gender quality and seek advice of relevant rights groups when updating the dictionary.
