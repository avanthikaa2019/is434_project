Brooklyn genre-bender Santi White has always attracted comparisons with controversial British-Sri Lankan rapper, M.I.A.
No wonder, for the two have the same warrior-princess, sex-kitten vibe. On White's second album - which comes after her well-received 2008 self-titled debut - she teams up with a slew of esteemed producers, including Diplo and Switch.
She tears through songs at record speed and with unmistakable conviction, no matter the genre, sounding perky on album opener Go! and slinky R&amp;Binfluenced Freak Like Me.
