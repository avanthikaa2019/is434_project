SINGAPORE - Those interested in attending National Day Parade (NDP) 2012 still have four more days before applications close.
Applications can be done via SMS to 9156-1557; official NDP 2012 website, SAM or AXS stations; or the 'NDPOnTheGo" mobile application.
Applicants may ballot for two, four or six tickets to attend either the NDP preview on Aug 4 or the actual NDP on Aug 9. Applying for fewer tickets will grant you a higher chance when balloting.
Applications submitted after May 20 will not qualify for balloting. Ballot results are final and no appeals will be entertained.
Additionally, each ticket strictly admits only one spectator. Children and infants must also hold a valid ticket to be admitted to the parade.
Successful applicants who provided a mobile number in their applications will be notified via SMS from June 1 to June 5. A failure to reply in confirmation may result in the tickets being forfeited. Those who submitted landline numbers instead will be notified by phone.
Tickets can be collected between June 8 to June 17 from 10am to 10pm daily at The Float@Marina Bay at 20 Raffles Avenue.
The organisers remind the public that NDP and Preview tickets are strictly not for sale.
