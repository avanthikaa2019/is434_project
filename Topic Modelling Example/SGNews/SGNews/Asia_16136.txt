MANILA - Police arrested five South Koreans just outside the Philippine capital on Monday after they were caught allegedly badly beating two of their countrymen with a baseball bat.
The five and their Filipino driver could face charges of kidnapping and attempted murder after a police patrol spotted them attacking their compatriots early in the morning in a field, said Senior Superintendent Rolando Anduyan.
"They were really caught in the act, in the process of hitting them with a baseball bat. If we hadn't arrived, then we would have dead foreigners on our hands," said Anduyan, the regional police chief.
The incident stemmed from the victims allegedly cheating the suspects in setting up an online gaming business in the northern Philippines, the police chief said.
It was the second notable arrest of South Koreans in the Philippines in just a few days.
On Friday, seven South Koreans were detained over an illegal online dog-fighting syndicate. Authorities said 300 badly injured pitbulls were rescued in a raid.
South Koreans have been flocking to the Philippines in recent years, attracted by the warm weather and affordable English-language lessons.
Almost a quarter of all foreign tourists who arrived in the Philippines in January were South Korean, the tourism department said.
