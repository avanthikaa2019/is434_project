WELLINGTON - A New Zealand teenager was Thursday named winner of a global youth contest to address June's United Nations Rio summit on sustainable development, saying she was "honoured" to speak at the event.
Brittany Trilford, 17, was announced winner of the global "Date With History" video speech contest on sustainability action, which was open to anyone across the world aged between 13 and 30 years of age.
Currently in her last year of school in Wellington, Trilford was chosen from 22 finalists to travel to the UN's Rio+20 summit to deliver her vision at the high-level gathering of global leaders and decision makers on June 20-22.
Actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Don Cheadle and musicians Linkin Park were on the panel of judges who voted for Trilford's speech, which was uploaded by video from New Zealand and selected as a finalist by a public online vote.
Contest organisers said it "is hoped that Brittany Trilford will receive a high-profile speaking opportunity" at the summit.
"I entered 'Date With History' to show solidarity with youth around the world, demanding that our leaders remember we are all their children and they owe us a fighting chance at a future we want to inherit," Trilford said.
"They need to act now so that we have a bright future, free from fear. I feel honoured to take up my obligation to stand up and be counted as one of my generation and the wisdom of youth at Rio+20."
Around 100 heads of state or government are expected for the Rio conference, which marks the 20th anniversary of the Earth Summit that declared the environment a priority, according to Brazilian sources.
