The official Songkran period is Friday, April 13 to Monday, April 16, inclusive.
PM's Office deputy spokesman Pakdihan Himathongkam said they had received a number of inquiries from officials at various agencies seeking clarification on whether the Cabinet would include April 17 as part of the Songkran break. But the issue was not raised during the Cabinet meeting today, he said.
Under the law, civil servants are entitled to a consecutive four-day holiday. Therefore, they will have only four days off for the Thai New Year, and will resume work on April 17, Pakdihan said.
