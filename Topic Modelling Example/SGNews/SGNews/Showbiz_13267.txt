LOS ANGELES - After vehemently denying a first claim, actor John Travolta has been hit by another accusation of sexual assault.
A second unidentified masseur is seeking US$2 million (S$2.5 million) in damages against Travolta, claiming the actor sexually assaulted him during a private massage, according to amended court documents filed on Tuesday.
The unnamed man, a resident of Georgia who is referred to as John Doe No. 2 in court papers, claimed that Travolta rubbed his legs, touched his genitals and tried to initiate sex at a private appointment in the actor's room inside an Atlantan hotel on Jan 28.
The allegations echo those of John Doe No. 1, a resident of Texas, who filed the initial complaint last week and accused Travolta of sexually assaulting him during a private massage at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Jan 16. He is also seeking US$2 million in damages.
"This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one," said attorney Martin Singer, who represents the Hollywood actor.
"Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims." Travolta's spokesman has called the lawsuit a "complete fiction and fabrication".
The plaintiff's attorney, Pasadena, California-based Okorie Okorocha, said that since the initial complaint was filed last week, he has had many more potential victims come forward with similar complaints.
Mr Okorocha said: "I will file for every single victim. Mr Travolta has been able to evade justice and he's going to challenge it with me, but I'm not afraid... I'll stand up to him."
