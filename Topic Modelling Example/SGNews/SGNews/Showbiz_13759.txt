MALAYSIA - Top Malaysian funnyman Bob Kuman, who died Thursday afternoon, has left big shoes to be filled.

He succumbed to his multiple illnesses at 4.40pm at his home in Kota Damansara, Kuala Lumpur.
His nephew performed CPR for 20 minutes before the paramedics arrived, but it couldn't save him.
Bob's wife Norma Ibrahim and his close friends were by his bedside.
The star will be buried in his hometown of Kampung Sawah in Negeri Sembilan on Friday morning.
