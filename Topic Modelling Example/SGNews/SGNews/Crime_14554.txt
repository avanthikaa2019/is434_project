JOHOR BARU - It was supposed to be the happiest time of her life, but for a 26-year-old factory worker tragedy struck when her husband-to-be was stabbed to death right in front of her a day before their wedding.
The woman, who wanted to be known only as Sharina, watched helplessly as her lover was savagely attacked by their three former housemates, all foreigners, over an incident when one of the men walked into the bathroom when she was taking her shower.
The victim, Indra Asrul (inset), 29, was fatally stabbed in front of a double-storey shophouse in Jalan Dedap 23 at 11.30pm on Saturday.
His grieving bride-to-be claimed that it was their Myanmar housemates, including a couple, who attacked Indra.
According to Sharina, one of the men walked into the bathroom while she was showering a week ago.
"The bathroom door was faulty and could not be locked properly.
"Indra confronted him over this but after the first incident, I suspected that the man took a peep whenever I showered," she said at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital mortuary here yesterday.
She then reported the matter to their landlord who advised them to move out to prevent any trouble.
"We moved out and stayed with my relative temporarily while we looked for a new place to stay as newly-weds.
"We returned to the shophouse on Saturday to get some of our things but before we could do so, the three rushed downstairs and attacked my fiance," she said.
One of the men used a metal rod and repeatedly stabbed Indra in the abdomen, Sharina said, adding that all three then fled.
"I could only hold him while waiting for the ambulance but he died 15 minutes later," she said.
The two were supposed to marry yesterday after planning their wedding for more than a year.
Seri Alam OCPD Supt Roslan Zainuddin said the police were still identifying the suspects.
