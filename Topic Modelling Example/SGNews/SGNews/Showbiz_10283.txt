Jamiroquai, one of the world's most famous acid jazz bands, is returning to dazzle Korean fans. For the first time in four years, the band will hold a concert on Aug. 22 at the Jamsil Gymnasium in Seoul, its Korean promoter said in a press release.
The band had tremendous success in the previous concert in Seoul with tickets sold out in just five minutes.
With the release of its seventh album "Rock Dust Light Star" in 2010, Jamiroquai began its world tour holding 83 concerts around the world.
For its Korean stopover, the "Audi Live 2012 ? Jamiroquai Korea Concert," the band will perform with instruments such as brass, percussion and keyboard to create a perfect dance floor during the hot summer, which would entice the fans, the band's promoter Access Entertainment said.
Known for its stylistic blend of funky and groovy melodies, the band has built up a strong fan base not only in the United States and England, but also in Korea.
Many people might think Jamiroquai is a solo artist, but the project band actually currently consists of six members.
The band was formed by vocalist Jay Kay in 1992 and quickly became the emblem of modern acid jazz with other renowned bands such as Incognito. The band experimented with different genres including electronic, disco, pop, trip hop, funk and dance, releasing seven regular albums and a number of single and live albums, four of them topping Britain's album charts. The band sold more than 25 million copies and has won the Grammy award for best pop group in 1997.
The band's name Jamiroquai, a mix of "jam" and the Native American tribe name "Iroquois," reflects its respect for Native Americans and their unique style of music.
