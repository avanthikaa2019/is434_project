TAIWAN - Incarcerated former President Chen Shui-bian should be immediately granted a medical transfer, said Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) interim Chairwoman Chen Chu late yesterday.
Earlier, the ex-president's son Chen Chih-chung said he suspects his father is suffering from a collapsed lung.
Citing humanitarian grounds and a prisoner's right to medical care, the chairwoman demanded that Chen Shui-bian be released immediately for care outside Taipei Prison.
Her statement was relayed to press by DPP spokesperson Lin Chun-hsien.
Chen Chu will direct the three heads and other members of the DPP's legislative caucus to call on the former president, said Lin.
Lung Collapse
Chen Chih-chung also asked the Ministry of Justice to transfer his father to an outside medical facility, saying he suspects his father has a collapsed lung..
In a press conference early yesterday, Chen furnished a recent five-page letter penned by his father to his mother, Wu Shu-chen.
The former president said he found it difficult to breathe and that he is in a critical physical condition, according to Chen Chih-chung.
"Last Saturday afternoon, I was standing before the lavatory and suddenly could not catch my breath. I almost passed out. It was a good thing I had been holding on. To fall would have been extremely troublesome," read Chen from his father's letter.
The ex-leader wrote that he reported the incident to the superintendent, who arranged for a physician to see him on Friday.
The letter continued: "My chest tightness, chest pain, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing all have not seen improvement. Even now as I write this letter on my stomach, I am gasping for air."
