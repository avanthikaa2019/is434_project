SINGAPORE - Two men and a woman have been arrested for suspected involvement in loansharking activites.
Police officers on anti-loanshark patrols along Towner Road came across a Chinese man behaving suspiciously on April 12.
Upon a check, officers discovered loanshark-related paraphernalia such as ATM cards, mobile phones and loanshark records on the 48-year-old.
They also found seven cartons of pamphlets advertising "easy loan" services in the suspect's taxi.
Preliminary investigations showed that the suspect had assisted loansharks in their businesses through carrying out ATM transfers. He also distributed pamphlets.
Following the arrest, the officers immediately mounted another operation where they arrested a 37-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman at St George's Road and Ang Mo Kio respectively.
These two suspects are believed to be assisting the first suspect in distributing the 'easy loan' pamphlets around Singapore. Investigations against the two suspects are ongoing.
The first suspect will be charged in court on April 14 for an offence under the Moneylenders Act (Revised Edition 2010).
First-time offenders found guilty of assisting in the carrying on of the business of an unlicensed moneylender may be fined not less than $30,000 and not more than $300,000, be imprisoned for a term of up to four years. The offender will also be liable to be punished with caning of up to six strokes.
