It has been less than a week since the start of the Euro 2012 football tournament and the Malaysian police have busted three betting syndicates with the arrest of 11 people in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Eight of the men nabbed were believed to be members of two illegal online syndicates, which were masterminded by two Malaysians, aged 26 and 75.
They allegedly collected bets of as much as RM200,000 (S$80,500) each, reported The Star. The police seized mobile phones, laptops, match schedules and betting receipts in the raid.
Bukit Aman CID director Mohd Bakri Zinin said more arrests were expected to be made and added that the police are not ruling out the possibility of the syndicates being masterminded by the same people involved in illegal betting during the 2010 World Cup.
On Sunday night, officers in Georgetown, Penang, raided a cafe and busted a betting syndicate.
Secret Societies, Gambling and Vice staff officer Zailani Amit said three men, including a 79-year-old, were detained in the 7.45pm raid.
He said the men would arrange bets on matches and received wagers of up to RM100,000 for eachmatch. "The police found gambling equipment, 49 pieces of paper suspected of holding betting information, some cash, two mobile phones and two Euro 2012 match schedules," he said.
