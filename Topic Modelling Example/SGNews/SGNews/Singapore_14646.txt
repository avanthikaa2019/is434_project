SINGAPORE - Twenty-three individuals were officially appointed as Fathers@Schools Ambassadors by the Fathers Action Network (FAN), the people-sector led consultative network which drives the Dads for Life movement.
The ambassadors will aim to more deeply engage fathers in the schools community by strengthening the involvement of those already on the programme and by assisting new schools in setting up and running their fathers groups and activities.
The appointment of the ambassadors was announced at the 2nd Anniversary Celebrations of the Fathers@Schools Programme, held at Paya Lebar Methodist Girls School (Secondary) this morning.
Membership numbers for the programme have more than doubled since its launch, growing from 55 schools in April 2010 to a current total of 162, including special education schools and preschools, in addition to mainstream primary and secondary schools.
New initiatives, especially within the schools community have been emerging in the past months, signalling significant shifts in the perceptions of the importance of fathers' roles and the ground up efforts to encourage involved fatherhood for the overall benefit of children.
The Fathers Action Network hopes that the 23 newly appointed ambassadors, all of whom have been active in the Fathers@Schools community for at least one year and have willingly committed their time to helping other fathers, will spread their passion to others and grow the community of active fathers in Singapore.
Mathew Pereira, Member of the Fathers Action Network said: &ldquo;Their appointment does not mark the start of their hard work. Instead, it will simply be a continuation of the positive change they have been making so far and an acknowledgement of the role that they play within the school community. It is our hope that with their dedication and support, we can reach even more fathers and bring Fathers@Schools to greater heights.&rdquo;
