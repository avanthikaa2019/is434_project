JAKARTA - An aviation observer says that it is unlikely that cell phones used in flight brought down the Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner that crashed on Wednesday.
"Even if there were phone calls made from the airplane, there would unlikely be a factor in the accident," former Garuda Indonesia pilots' union chief Shadrach Nababan told The Jakarta Post.
The pilot was responding to an article published on kompasiana.com that said the active mobile phones used by passengers during the flight might have led to the crash.
Shadrach, who currently flies Airbus-330s for Garuda Airlines, said that phone calls did not create large disruptions of airplane communication systems.
"There are other possible factors, such as human error, an obsolete database or the broken warning systems. However, creating assumptions in times like these will only create grief for the victims' families. Just wait for the official investigation's results," he added.
The Russian Superjet lost contact with air traffic controllers on Wednesday before searchers found the crashed plan in the foothills near Mt. Salak on Thursday morning.
Bad weather and rough terrain have hindered searchers as they attempt to recover the 12 bodies currently found amid the plane's wreckage.
