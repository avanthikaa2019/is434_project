Guang Ming Daily reported that Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau followed Hong Kong traditions of holding a 100-day party for his daughter Heung Wai, instead of a full-moon celebration.
He organised a five-table banquet for relatives and friends. But only five people from showbiz were invited to the event. They were Deanie Ip, Michael Miu Kiu-wai, Felix Wong Yat-wah, Sammi Cheng and Gordon Lam Ka-tung.
Earlier, Lau was spotted applying for a birth certificate for his daughter with Malaysian wife Carol Chu. A copy of the document was leaked to the media.
