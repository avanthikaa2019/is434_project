BAMAKO, MALI - The leader of putschists who ousted Mali's president in March will retain the title of former head of state and all privileges coming with it, interim authorities and the West African ECOWAS bloc said Sunday.
"Captain Amadou Sanogo has the status of former head of state. He will have all the benefits coming with his rank," Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Djibrill Bassole, one of the mediators in the post-coup crisis, said on state radio.
The Malian authorities and ECOWAS mediators also agreed on a transition period to full democratic rule of one year.
The agreement was signed by Sanogo, Mali's interim President Dioncounda Traore, his Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra and Bassole, sources close to Sanogo and the mediators said.
Bassole and the foreign ministers of Ivory Coast and Nigeria, Adama Bictogo and Mohamed Nourredine, have been on their mediation mission in Bamako since Saturday when they reached an agreement in principle for Traore to head the transition period until elections can be held.
No timeline was given.
