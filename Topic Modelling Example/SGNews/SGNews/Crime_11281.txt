Police have arrested a 25-year-old woman who is believed to have vandalised several roads in Singapore.
Between May 17 to 21 this year, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) saw that the words "MY GRANDFATHER ROAD" were painted along Robinson Road and Maxwell Road and reported the matter to the Police.
It also reported that circular stickers printed with captions were pasted on a pavement around Lau Pa Sat and on a road traffic sign along Robinson Road.
The female suspect was arrested at her residence in the eastern part of Singapore on June 3. The officers also found several paint-stained stencils and several pieces of stickers printed with captions. These items were seized for investigation.
Investigation is ongoing. The police are also working with LTA on earlier reports of round stickers found affixed on other pedestrian crossings at various places.
The case is classified as Vandalism under Section 3 of the Vandalism Act, Chapter 341. A person who is convicted for the offence shall be punished with a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding to 3 years and shall be liable to caning subjected to the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.
The police warned that it takes a serious view of such irresponsible actions and offenders will be dealt with severely.
Netizens have reacted to the arrest by calling for the release of the woman, whom they have dubbed 'sticker lady.'
The petition, started by Facebook user Stephenie Choy, is collecting 20,000 signatures to ask the Government to ease their restrictions on public 'art' and reduce the arrested woman's charge from Vandalism to Miscellaneous Offences.
"If you agree that the arrest of this particular artist is unwarranted and that there should be less restriction in public art, please join this event, and leave your name on the wall," the aspiring future arts educator wrote.
