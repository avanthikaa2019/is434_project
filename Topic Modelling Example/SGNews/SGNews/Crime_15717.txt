SEPANG, Malaysia - An Indian national who was trying to smuggle in 12kg of ketamine hidden in 12 wall mirrors was apprehended at the Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT) here.
KLIA Customs deputy director Siti Baya Berahan said they found a suspicious image on the scanner when they examined the mirrors, each the size of an A3 paper.
"We conducted a thorough inspection and we found a layer of plastic sandwiched between the mirror and its back frame," she said here yesterday.
"The plastic contained white powder, which was later confirmed to be ketamine, worth an estimated RM480,000 (S$197,424)."
The 26-year-old man had arrived at the LCCT from Bangalore at 2.30am on Thursday.
In an unrelated case, Siti Baya said they had raided a high-end condominium in Jalan Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur, on the same day.
She said they found 5.4kg of syabu, 99g of ketamin, 140 eramin 5 pills, 575 ecstasy pills and 12g of ganja worth RM1.43 million.
"Two men from Hong Kong, who were in the house, have been arrested," she said, adding that the men were aged 56 and 60.
