SINGAPORE - A former part-time customer service assistant with the United Overseas Bank has been charged under the Computer Misuse Act for using the debit card of her ex-lover to make purchases.
Sheena Seng Wang Ru, 28, was fined $25,200 on Friday for her acts, The Straits Times reported.
According to the report in 2010, Seng used the debit card of Lee Hwa Chai to make purchases worth $2,115. She also made ATM withdraws totalling $571.
Mr Lee, 31, lodged a complaint with the bank on Jan 27, 2010. His debit card was subsequently blocked but Seng forged his signatures on cash withdrawal forms and was able to withdraw $6,350 in February and March 2010.
Mr Lee filed another complaint with the bank but later withdrew it. Checks had revealed that Seng carried out the transactions.
They also revealed that she had checked his bank balance before spending and withdrawing an amount over $9,000.
The report quoted Assistant Public Prosecutor Charlene Yang as saying that Seng had broke the law by abusing her teller position to access Mr Lee's bank account when she was not authorised to do so.
The court was informed that when Seng and Mr Lee were still in a relationship, Seng was privy to his bank details with his knowledge. She also used his debit card to make purchases when he was away.
When their relationship failed, Seng felt it was justifiable for her to continue accessing his bank account as she was very upset. Seng thought she had been made use of.
The report added that while the district judge noted the special circumstances, he was not in favour of too light a fine.
