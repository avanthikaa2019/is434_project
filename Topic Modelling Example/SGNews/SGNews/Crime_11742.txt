A third man has been charged in court for attempting to fix the football game between the LionsXIII and the Sarawk FA that was played on May 22.
Selvarajan Letchuman was charged with two offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
On May 19, the 49-year-old met Shokri Bin Nor, a part-time soccer referee under the Football Association of Malaysia, at a hotel room in Cititel Hotel, Penang.
He allegedly gave the referee RM500 (S$200) to fix the result of the match, played at the Jalan Besar Stadium.
His second charge is for agreeing to give the same referee, Shokri bin Nor, a sum of up to RM15,000, also to fix the result of the match.
Selvarajan's lawyer said his client was claiming trial.
A pre-trial conference has been scheduled for June 28
