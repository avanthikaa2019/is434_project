ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on early hours of Thursday nominated Makhdoom Shahabuddin for the post of prime minister, while, Raja Pervez Ashraf will be a covering candidate, DawnNews reported.
The president, after consulting the coalition parties and Pakistan People's Party's (PPP) Parliamentary Party members, has nominated Shahabuddin for the post which became vacant after disqualification of Yousuf Raza Gilani by the Supreme Court.
Both, Shahabuddin and Ashraf will submit their nomination papers today.
Earlier, addressing the meeting of the PPP's Parliamentary Party members at the Presidency, the president said that the decision to nominate a new leader of the House would be taken in consultation with the coalition partners and in the larger national interest.
Zardari said that the PPP did not want confrontation among state institutions, and that it would ensure that the democratic process continues without any disruption.
Presently a member of the National Assembly (February 2008 onwards) and textiles minister, Shahabuddin has earlier held the portfolios of federal minister for finance and health in the Gilani-led government.
Coming from Southern part of Punjab province's Rahim Yar Khan city, Shahabuddin has been politically affiliated to the PPP.
Meanwhile, some media outlets had reported on Wednesday that Shahabuddin could face arrest anytime by the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) for his alleged involvement in Ephedrine case.
The apex court on Tuesday had declared Yousuf Raza Gilani disqualified from holding a seat in the parliament for refusing to reopen graft cases against President Zardari.
