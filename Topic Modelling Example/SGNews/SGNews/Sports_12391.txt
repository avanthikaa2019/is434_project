LONDON - Former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas insisted Monday that he won't be rushed into a decision on his future.
The 34-year-old, whose former club Chelsea won the Champions League at the weekend, has been linked with the Liverpool job since Kenny Dalglish's departure.
Villas-Boas was quoted by The Independent as saying: "I'm still choosing the right project and that decision will take the necessary time."
The Portuguese also congratulated his successor at Chelsea, Roberto Di Matteo, on the English club's European victory over Bayern Munich.
"The biggest award is to win the Champions League," said Villas-Boas.
"Congratulations to Di Matteo and the players."
