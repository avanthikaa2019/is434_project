SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has written to construction companies here to ask them to 'take immediate steps to rectify practices' that subject foreign workers to one-sided, unfair contracts.
The circular educates and warns employers on illegal practices that are not in accordance to Singapore's employment laws, The Straits Times reported.
This includes cutting an employee's salary if he or she is absent from work, breaks safety rules, for medical fees or repatriation costs, or as a penalty against terminating a contract early.
Employers were also warned that it's illegal to retain a worker's salary as a means to ensure good behaviour or to enforce personal savings.
While employment-related complaints filed by foreign workers to MOM has decreased by 1,450 cases since 2009, the ministry said it is upping its efforts to target errant employers.
In 2011, 26 employers were convicted of employment related offences, and were fined between $1,000 and $31,500.
