LUXEMBOURG - The European Union agreed Monday to slap new sanctions on the Syrian regime, banning luxury goods exports and further restricting the sale of items used to repress dissidents, a diplomat said.
"These sanctions will be put in place against Syria," the diplomat told AFP after EU ambassadors endorsed measures ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
The extent of the luxury ban has yet to be defined but the aim is to deliver a symbolic blow against the posh lifestyle of President Bashar al-Assad and his glamorous British-born wife Asma, another diplomat said.
The EU also decided to expand the blacklist of dual-use goods which can be used for internal repression or for the manufacturing of equipment used for internal repression.
The 14th round of EU sanctions comes as violences continues in Syria despite the presence of UN truce observers in the country.
