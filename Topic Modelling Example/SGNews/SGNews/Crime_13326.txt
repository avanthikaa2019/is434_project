SHERDALI Mohd Ali, a man convicted at the Intermediate Court last year for human trafficking, had his appeal against the sentence dismissed by the Court of Appeal yesterday.
The Intermediate Court on January 27, 2011 sentenced the Malaysian national to serve four years and six months in prison after he was found guilty.
The appellant was also fined US$5,000 (S$6,279) in default of 10 months in jail for obtaining a forged travel document, a Malaysian passport registered under Majeid Khalad from Afghanistan for the purpose of facilitating human trafficking.
He was also fined US$1,000 in default of two months in jail for possession of a forged Malaysian passport bearing the name of Mohammad Yonas Khan Abdul Kahar in order for him to enter and remain in Brunei at the Labu Immigration Control Post, Temburong on June 10, 2010.
Sherdali was the first person convicted under human trafficking in Brunei.
During the appeal session before President of the Court of Appeal Justice John Barry Mortimer and Judicial Commissioners of the Supreme Court Justice Geofrey Lance Davies and Justice David John Leonard yesterday, Sherdali put forward his grounds for appeal citing his age and his health as a factor as well as his responsibilities towards his family who are facing difficulties without his support.
The court however, in delivering their verdict yesterday, dismissed the appeal as it was not manifestly excessive.
