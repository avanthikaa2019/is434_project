KUALA LUMPUR - A local vice syndicate is actively using Twitter to offer "high-class social escorts" to foreign visitors with the same pool of call girls sent to spas and private clubs.
These pimps cash in on major tourism events in the country, like the recent Formula 1 Grand Prix with tweets such as: "Malaysia escorts for F1 GP race in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Hotel escorts."
They entice prospective clients with suggestive messages like: "Chinese office girl escorts in Kuala Lumpur" or "Russian escorts services in #KL incall and outcall".
A probe by The Star showed that the syndicate charged foreign clients up to three or four times higher than the usual prices for sexual services in the Klang Valley.
