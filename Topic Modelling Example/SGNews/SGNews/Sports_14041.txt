Former Manchester United defensive stalwarts Denis Irwin and Paul Parker completed a whirlwind three days of promotional activities in Singapore last Saturday.
In town since last Thursday to kick off the Singapore leg of Man United's Champions Trophy Tour, organised by express and logistics company DHL, the duo also helped conduct a football clinic and launch a talent search.
Last Saturday morning, they teamed up with coaches from the Manchester United Soccer School to conduct the Epson United Spirit Soccer Clinic, which is a coaching session for 30 youths from the Singapore Children's Society.
After the coaching clinic, they turned guest scouts for Nike's The Chance talent-searchtrials at the Ministry of Education's Physical and Sports Education Branch in Evans Road.
Irwin picked out three youngsters to go for The Chance Boot Camp next month, where the top 30 players will be selected for the Country Finals, the first step towards the global finals.
Meanwhile, to tie in with tomorrow morning's Barclays Premier League clash between Man United and Man City, the Man United Concept Shop in Singapore is holding a storewide 20 per cent discount at its two shops in Marina Bay Sands and CityLink Mall today and tomorrow.
