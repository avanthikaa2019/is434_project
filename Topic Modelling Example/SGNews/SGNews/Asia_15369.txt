It would be wise to carry your own pen when asking people to sign important documents in the future.
Pens with ink that fades away after a few days have become hot items on the market place, Guangzhou Daily reported Monday.
The pens, mostly used in textile and handicraft industries for temporary marking, are now also being deployed to commit economic fraud, the paper claims.
According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, a man surnamed Wang swindled 250,000 yuan (S$40,000) from his creditor after signing a debt document with the special pen in January.
Characters can fade away within 10 days, according to the description at an online shop.
The pens have also been used for signing private lending agreements, contracts and checks, local police said.
