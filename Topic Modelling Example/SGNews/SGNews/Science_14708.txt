SAN FRANCISCO - Google co-founder Larry Page stuck to his guns in a San Francisco court on Wednesday, testifying that the Internet giant did nothing wrong when it built the Android platform for mobile gadgets.
Mr Page returned to the stand to field questions in a trial over accusations by business software titan Oracle that Google opted to infringe on Java programme copyright and patents instead of licensing code from Sun Microsystems.
"We did nothing wrong," Mr Page said.
"We are very careful about what information we use and do not use."
Mr Page held firm even when confronted with a key piece of evidence - an e-mail from Android team engineers saying that Google should license Java technology from Sun Microsystems.
Google's efforts to incorporate Java into a smartphone platform failed and Google went its own way with Android, according to Mr Page.
"I think Sun, and now Oracle, needed something that actually worked," Mr Page said.
"We had a closet full of Java phones that didn't work."
"Things like the iPhone didn't have Java at all and somehow magically got in consumers' hands," Mr Page said.
"I don't think it mattered."
