KUALA LUMPUR - Police have identified the culprits behind the assault and robbery of a woman at a shopping mall car park in the city recently.
City deputy CID chief Asst Comm Khairy Ahrasa said police were looking for six suspects who were believed to be behind several robberies in Brickfields recently.
"We know who they are and we are looking for them," he said during a press conference at the city police headquarters yesterday.
He said that the suspects, aged between 20 and 40 years old, had been active since March this year after being released from the Simpang Renggam detention centre.
The attack on Saturday resulted in the victim being slashed on her head as she tried to prevent a man from stealing her handbag at the car park of Midvalley Megamall.
About 32 hours later, a woman nearly had her finger severed by an armed robber as she stopped in front of her friend's house along Jalan Datuk Sulaiman at Taman Tun Dr Ismail.
