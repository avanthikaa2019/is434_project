40 per cent of all work fatalities were caused by falls from heights in 2011, according to the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSH).
To reduce such fatalities, new initiatives to address falls from heights were revealed by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and WSH National Work at Heights Taskforce this afternoon.
Some of the new initiatives include a set of guidelines highlighting safe practices when working on roofs, and a handbook and stickers on using ladders safely.
Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Manpower Hawazi Daipi shared that efforts are focused on four critical areas: roof works, work on ladders, work on structures, and work on scaffolds and mobile elevated work platforms.
The new initiative also looks at enhancing the Work at Heights regulatory framework to improve compliance through enforcement. MOM is currently exploring the introduction of a dedicated set of regulations for working at heights.
"This includes mandating Fall Prevention Plans for all workplaces and extending the Permit-to-work system, which already exists for scaffold operations," said Mr Daipi at the Programme-Based Engagement Plus (ProBE Plus) forum this afternoon.
MOM will also work closely with industry stakeholders and initiate public consultations to better understand industry practises and work environments.
"Stakeholders must immediately take proactive actions and put preventative measures in place to prevent fatal falls at work," said Mr Wong Weng Sun, Chairman of the National Work at Heights Taskforce
The ProBE programme was launched in 2006 by the Ministry of Manpower to raise standards of work place safety by engaging industries and by training workers to manage safety risks at work.
