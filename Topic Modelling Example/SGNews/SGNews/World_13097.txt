PANAMA CITY - Panama's ex-dictator Manuel Noriega will remain hospitalized over the weekend, even though his health has improved after a bout with bronchitis, officials said Friday.
Noriega is "in stable medical condition and without fever," but on the recommendation of specialists will remain in a Panama City hospital "for three more days to rule out any complication," the government said in a statement.
The 78-year-old was transferred to a hospital Wednesday from the prison where he is serving three consecutive 20-year sentences for the disappearance of opponents during his years in power, from 1983 to 1989.
A one-time CIA informant who was overthrown in a US invasion, Noriega has been in and out of the hospital three times since his return home in December.
"It should be clarified that the problems for which the inmate Noriega was hospitalized has nothing to do with the hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebral problems" that he suffers from, the government statement said.
Noriega has suffered two strokes, and has heart disease and a benign brain tumor diagnosed as meningioma.
His doctors and lawyers have been seeking permission for him to serve out his prison term in a hospital or under house arrest because of his health.
