KUALA LUMPUR - Only three days into Euro 2012 and police have crippled three betting syndicates with the arrest of 11 people here and Penang.
Eight of the men who were picked up here were believed to be members of two illegal online syndicates.
The two syndicates were master-minded by two Malaysians, aged 26 and 75. They were said to have collected bets as much as RM200,000 (S$80,700) each.
In the raids, police seized handphones, laptops, match schedules and betting receipts.
Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Seri Mohd Bakri Zinin told reporters that more arrests were expected to be made.
He said police also did not rule out the possibility of the syndicates being master-minded by the same people involved in illegal betting during the World Cup 2010.
During the World Cup season, police conducted 270 raids on syndicates involved in bets worth RM419mil. A total of 227 people, including 17 women, were detained nationwide.
In George Town, police raided a cafe in Jalan Datuk Keramat and crippled a syndicate which took bets as much as RM100,000 on Sunday night.
Secret Societies, Gambling and Vice staff officer DSP Zailani Amit said three men, including a 79-year-old, were detained in the 7.45pm raid.
He said the men would arrange bets on matches and received wagers of up to RM100,000 (S$40,400) for each match.
Police found several gambling hardware and equipment, 49 pieces of paper suspected of holding betting information, some cash, two mobile phones and two Euro 2012 match schedules," he said.
Also in George Town, police raided a coffee shop in Datuk Keramat for illegal betting activities where they saw the familiar face of a 79-year-old who was caught for a similar offence during the World Cup 2010 two years ago.
He was among the three people nabbed during an operation on Sunday to crack down on illegal bookmaking activities.
Sources said the members could have received about RM400,000 (S$161, 500) in bets before their arrest at about 7.45pm.
The operation was led by state police headquarters anti-vice, gambling and secret societies (D7) officer Deputy Supt Zailani Amit.
