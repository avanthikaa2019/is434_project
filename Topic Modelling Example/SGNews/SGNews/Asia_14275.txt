ISLAMABAD - Pakistan's main opposition leader Nawaz Sharif Thursday demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani after he was convicted of contempt of court.
"Prime Minister should immediately resign. He should step down without causing further crisis," Sharif said live on the private television station Geo.
Sharif, who has twice served as prime minister and leads the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), also called for fresh elections.
"The court verdict is based on truth and reality. It must have punished the prime minister with a heavy heart, but the prime minister himself is to be blamed," he said.
"The Prime Minister himself invited this situation," he added.
The Supreme Court convicted Gilani of contempt on Thursday over his refusal to write to authorities in Switzerland asking them to reopen corruption investigations into President Asif Ali Zardari.
He was given only a nominal sentence, detained for a few minutes until the court adjourned, but could still be forced out of office.
