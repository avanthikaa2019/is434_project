SINGAPORE - An American hotel guest at the Swissotel The Stamford died from a fall from a height of at least 60 storeys in the wee hours of the morning on Sunday.
The 40-year-old, whose identity is withheld by the hotel to respect her family's privacy, landed on an inaccessible metal parapet three storeys from the ground level, said The Straits Times (ST).
On Sunday at about 4.10am, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) received a call for assistance at Raffles City along Stamford Road.
The woman was found by paramedics to have suffered multiple injuries.
According to ST, the woman was thought unlikely to survive the impact of her fall, which delivered a 'severe blunt force trauma', damaging also the parapet.
When they got to the scene, they could not reach her where she landed on the parapet near the 24-hour Starbucks coffee joint at Raffles City.
They had to access a staircase to get to her and retrieve her body using safety harnesses and rescue lines.
As they approached her, parts of the parapet gave way and her body fell to the ground, landing outside Starbucks.
No customers or employees were standing outside, at the spot where the body landed, at the time.
Police are still investigating and have classified the case as an unnatural death.
A hotel spokesman said the hotel extended its deepest condolences to her family and friends. It is also helping the police with investigations.
The Swissotel The Stamford is the tallest hotel here at 73 stories and one of South-east Asia's tallest.
Starbucks said the woman's fall had damaged the roof of its outdoor seating area and caused water leakage.
However, it is business as usual for the cafe, although the outdoor area is currently closed for repairs.
A Raffles City spokesman told ST that retail operations were as usual at the mall.
