Nakhon Si Thammarat native Surasak Suwannachote, 26, and Samut Sakhon native Surin Thatthong, 37, were taken to the crime scene on Kata Noi Road in Phuket's Muang district to re-enact the crime, in which they allegedly murdered Australian travel agent Michelle Elizabeth Smith, 59, and severely wounded her companion, Tammee Lee Lynn, 42.
As national police chief Priewpan Damapong and local police watched the 30-minute re-enactment, a crowd of Phuket residents and tourists showed up and began scolding the duo.
Some carried signs saying they didn't welcome outsiders committing crimes in their neighbourhood. Police had to speedily escort the duo from the scene immediately after the re-enactment.
National police deputy chief Pansiri Prapawat told a press conference police were now looking for the murder weapon.
Pansiri said police have focused on beefing up security at this popular holiday resort island by installing more security cameras, as well as tackling other issues such as illegal taxis and jet-ski operators taking advantage of tourists.
