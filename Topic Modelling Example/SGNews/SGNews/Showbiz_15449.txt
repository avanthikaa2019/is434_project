ACTRESS Lindsay Lohan, on the comeback trail after being released from formal probation last month, on Monday strongly denied a claim that she had shoved a woman in a West Hollywood nightclub.
Lohan's spokesman said the 25-year-old was never at the nightclub in question and called the allegations "malicious and unfounded".
