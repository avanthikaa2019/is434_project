TAIPEI - Taiwan's agricultural losses have surpassed NT$700 million after days of heavy rainfall around the island, according to the latest government statistics released yesterday.
As a result of recent heavy precipitation brought by an air current from the southwest and Tropical Storm Talim, the agricultural losses have reached NT$744.39 million (S$32.5 million), the Council of Agriculture said.
Noting the impact of the heavy rain, Premier Sean Chen has asked the council to keep a close eye on the losses in the agricultural industry and provide timely assistance to farmers, Cabinet spokesman Hu Yu-wei said at a news briefing early in the day.
Measures to be taken include granting subsidies to farmers whose farmland has been affected by the rain, Hu said, adding that the council will purchase ruined grain.
According to the council, rice is the most seriously damaged crop. Affected crops also include watermelons, persimmons, papayas, grapes and leaf vegetables.
