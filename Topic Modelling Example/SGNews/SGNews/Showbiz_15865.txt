LONDON - Jim Marshall, who pioneered guitar amplifiers used by some of the greatest names in rock earning him the nickname "Lord of Loud", has died aged 88.
"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of our beloved founder and leader for the past 50 years, Jim Marshall," said a statement on the company's website.
"While mourning the Guv'nor though, we also salute a legendary man who led a full and truly remarkable life."
Tributes poured in for a man credited with helping to shape the sound of guitar rock.
"The news of Jim Marshall passing is deeply saddening,"former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said in a message on Twitter. "R &amp; R will never be the same w/out him. But, his amps will live on FOREVER!"
His company said in a written tribute: "Your memory, the music and joy your amps have brought to countless millions for the past five decades and that world-famous, omnipresent script logo that proudly bears your name will always live on."
Born in London in 1923, Marshall started out as a drummer before going into business and founding Marshall Amplification in 1962.
He began making guitar amplifiers in Britain as a cheaper alternative to U.S. imports, and soon after legendary musicians including Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton were using his equipment.
He is revered as one of the four forefathers of rock music equipment along with Leo Fender, Les Paul and Seth Lover.
