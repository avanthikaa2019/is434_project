A law graduate who, with her boyfriend, stole $448 worth of drinks, rice, and power and extension plugs was on Friday placed on 15 months' probation.
Ong Shi Han, 23, was with Jeremy Kuek Beng Kiat, also 23, on Nov 12 last year near midnight when they left Kuek's Blue Horizon condominium unit.
As they walked past a carpark at the West Coast condominium, she spotted drinks in a storage room of a convenience store.
When they returned to Kuek's home an hour later and realised there were no drinks in the refrigerator, Ong suggested stealing drinks from the storage room.
She tried in vain several times to reach the drinks through a hole in the storage room gate, then resorted to using a bolt cutter to cut the padlock securing the gate.
They made away with items that included three boxes of 12 1.5-litre bottles and five boxes of 24 500ml bottles of drinks.
Kuek, an Imperial College aeronautical engineering student, was jailed one day on May 11.
