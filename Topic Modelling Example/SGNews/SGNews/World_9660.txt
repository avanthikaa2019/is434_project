DAMASCUS - The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday condemned the killing of a Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer, in the fourth such incident in the country's deadly unrest.
Bashar al-Youssef, 23, was shot and fatally wounded on Friday in Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, the two organisations said in a joint statement.
"The Syrian Arab Red Crescent and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) strongly condemn the shooting" as "further evidence of an extremely disturbing disregard for life-saving medical services in Syria," they said.
"This comes at a time when the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are virtually the only organisations able to work in areas affected by the violence in Syria," said Alexandre Equey, deputy head of the ICRC's delegation in the country.
Since the start of 2012, "the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent have assisted some 400,000 people in dire need of life-saving aid, in some of the most hard-hit areas in Syria," the statement reads.
"All their activities have been entirely impartial and neutral. This humanitarian work must be respected by everyone and at all times."
The organisations said Youssef was shot while on first-aid duty, although he was wearing a uniform clearly marked with the Red Crescent emblem, and died of his wounds a few hours later.
"This is the fourth killing of this kind since September 2011," it said.
The ICRC said "health-care personnel, particularly Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers, must be able to provide aid unhindered and in safety. The Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems must be respected by all sides."
