BERLIN - Luka Rocco Magnotta, a porn actor dubbed the "Canadian Psycho" for allegedly killing and chopping up his lover, is due to appear before a judge in Berlin after his arrest on Monday.
"The suspect will be presented today to the judge who will confirm his detention," Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the Berlin public prosecutor, told AFP, adding it could take several days to arrange his extradition to Canada.
Police in Berlin picked up Magnotta, 29, at an Internet cafe Monday after a days-long global hunt for the man believed to have murdered his Chinese lover with an ice pick, dismembered his body and filmed the grisly killing.
Canadian authorities have said they are working on documents needed to secure Magnotta's extradition from Germany, after the manhunt that started in Montreal and shifted to Paris before ending in Berlin.
Magnotta, dubbed the "Butcher of Montreal" and the "Canadian Psycho," has been wanted since last week when body parts from Chinese student Lin Jun were mailed to political party offices in Ottawa.
Lin's torso was found in a suitcase left for garbage collection outside Magnotta's Montreal apartment.
