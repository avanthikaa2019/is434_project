Old flames are a pesky lot.
I don't know about anyone else but, to me, they fall into the category of "dead and buried".
The Taiwanese drama Ex-Boyfriend poses this question: What would you do when a cheating ex resurfaces as (drum roll) your subordinate?
There is one answer - take revenge.
That is what project manager Lin Chun Jiao (played by the cutesy Gina Li) gleefully decides to do, when her philandering but essentially good-hearted former boyfriend Lai Zhi Ming (Tony Yang, right) is hired to be her assistant.
What follows is a myriad of hilarity ensuing from malicious spite (on her part) to bewildered fumbling (on his part) as he tries to please her.
If you want to enjoy an hour- long ride with either Li, Yang or fellow co-star Jerry Huang on the Singapore Flyer, here's how.
