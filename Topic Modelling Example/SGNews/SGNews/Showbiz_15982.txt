Pop singer Katy Perry will be performing at this year's Formula One Grand Prix.
Perry is the latest addition to the line-up of artistes performing this year - she will join Maroon 5 and Taiwanese singer Jay Chou at the Padang stage over the Singapore Grand Prix race weekend.
The global superstar, who just concluded her sold-out "California Dreams" tour, is slated to take the stage on Sunday, Sep 23, a day after Chou's performance on Friday (Sep 21), and Maroon 5 on Saturday (Sep 22).
Fans will be able to watch the multi-platinum artiste perform her chart-topping hits up-close at a specially demarcated fan zone right in front of the Padang stage.
Up to 2,000 fan zone wristbands, which provide guaranteed access to the zone, will be up for grabs. The number of wristbands given to each registered patron will be equivalent to the number of tickets purchased.
Fans can access the Padang concert as well as all entertainment offerings in Zone 4 with any ticket to the night race, which is priced from $178 for a three-day Zone 4 Walkabout ticket.
