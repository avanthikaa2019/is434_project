SINGAPORE - Local Duet Free representatives Crystal Yap and Stephanie Chen mesmerised the home crowd with a sterling performance of their own on the final day of synchronised swimming competition at the SEA Swimming Championships 2012.
However, they fell just short to Malaysia by a mere 0.51 points to take silver position. Malaysia's Katrina Ann Abdul Hadi and Zyanne Lee won the gold medal with 74.73 points.
"It's a pity that we lost out by just 0.51 points but I am really proud of our performance and we will do our best next time to better Malaysia," said 17-year-old Stephanie Chen.
The pair just lost out on overall artistic impression scores from the judges.
Malaysian coach Long Yan said: "This is Katrina and Zyanne's first competition together and I am happy that they are able to better their partnership, in terms of their synchronisation and coordination in their routines. This is a great collaborative effort by all SEA countries and I am happy to see the participation by many nations."
In the Team Combination event, Singapore's choreography and technical execution trumped Vietnam of the gold medal to win with 73.78 points.
This was the team that set the record as the first SEA nation to qualify for the team combination final event at the 2011 FINA Swimming Championships in Shanghai. The Malaysian team will fly home as the best performing country, topping the medal tally with four gold medals.
Singapore comes a close second with three gold and four silver - with a total of seven medals - and Vietnam rounds up the medal tally in third with three silver and four bronze.
Myanmar is fourth with one bronze, concluding the end of the SEA Swimming Championships 2012.
