SINGAPORE - The police are looking for the woman shown in the picture (above) to assist with investigations into a series of cheating scams reported islandwide.
Between Feb 20 and April 6 2012, the police have received several reports pertaining to a woman suspect soliciting monies from victims on the pretext that her husband was hospitalised and needed money urgently.
Out of sympathy, the victims had handed monies ranging from $50 to $450 as loans to the suspect who promised to repay on the following day. After collecting the money, the suspect became evasive and remained uncontactable.
The suspect is described as a Malay woman in her 30s, between 1.55m and 1.6m tall, of medium built and has short or shoulder length hair.
Anyone with information can call the Police Hotline at 1800 255 0000. All Information will be kept strictly confidential.
Members of the public are reminded to be wary when they encounter such cases of similar nature. They should not hesitate to call the police if they sense something is amiss.
