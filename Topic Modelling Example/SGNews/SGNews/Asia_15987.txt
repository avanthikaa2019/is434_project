SINGAPORE - Senior officials from the ASEAN member states came together yesterday to strengthen ties in the fight against regional human trafficking.
The 22nd Heads of Specialist Units (HSU) for Trafficking in Persons Meeting (TIP) was hosted by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) this year.
SPF is the current Chair of the regional multi-agency discussion platform.
Initiated in 2004, the regular meetings among the ASEAN countries facilitate the law enforcement agencies, and in particular, the respective specialist Anti-Trafficking Units to work together so as to improve their communications and cooperation.
Such crimes are often transnational in nature and require international cooperation between law enforcement agencies and Governments, said SPF.
Singapore's National Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons for 2012 to 2015 was released on March 21 this year.
In line with one of the four strategies to increase partnerships with other countries, SPF said it has been stepping up efforts to enhance regional cooperation to combat TIP.
