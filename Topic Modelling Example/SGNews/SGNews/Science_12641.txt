If a greenshoe option for underwriters is exercised, as expected, the stake sold increases to 18 per cent, raising north of S$20 billion.
More than half of the proceeds of the IPO will go to existing shareholders, including early backers such as Accel Partners and Russia's DST Global.
The more bullish had expected Facebook to price at $40 per share. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell by more than 2 per cent on Thursday, quelling such optimism.
"I expect it to open at a nice premium, but I don't expect a LinkedIn-type performance because of the sheer size of this IPO," said Scott Sweet of research firm IPO Boutique.
Shares of professional networking company LinkedIn Corp doubled on their first day of trading.
Lee Simmons, industry specialist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet, forecast a 10 per cent to 20 per cent gain for Facebook on Friday.
"You've got a large offering at an increased price, so a huge pop may be difficult to achieve," Simmons said. "When you're talking about doubling or a pop the size of LinkedIn..., the others were smaller floats, under 10 per cent, so you had this artificial feeding frenzy."
Facebook has 33 underwriters for the IPO, led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
