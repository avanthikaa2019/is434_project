JAKARTA - The Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) Jakarta branch turned down Monday the government's plan to develop cheap housing for journalists, deeming the program as a soft bribe.
"AJI Jakarta rejects the cheap housing for journalists program initiated by the Public Housing Ministry because it is contradictory to point 13 of the AJI ethics, stipulating that journalists don't use their position and information they have for profiting themselves," AJI Jakarta chairman Umar Idris said in a press statement sent to The Jakarta Post.
It also contradicts journalistic ethics that says that journalists do not accept bribes, he continued.
Umar noted that the scheme that would be used by the government to fund the program, the housing loan liquidity facility (FLPP), was designed to fund programs for citizen with income lower than Rp 3.5 million (S$479.50) per month and don't have a house yet.
"The facts that the [cheap housing for journalists] program is designed based on profession instead of income and that the government doesn't apply equal treatment for other professions like teachers or nurses means that the government has abused the facility," Umar said.
He added that such facilities could also influence journalists in doing their journalistic work.
The Public Housing Ministry announced recently that it was developing 1,000 houses for journalists in Citayam, Depok, just south of Jakarta, with each house to be sold for Rp 45 million, with a 10 per cent down payment and up to Rp 400,000 in monthly installments.
Public Housing Minister Djan Faridz said that there was no political motive behind the program and that the program was merely a form of the government's appreciation for journalists.
Umar pointed out that programs to develop housing for journalists should be arranged by media companies working with financial institutions or cooperatives.
