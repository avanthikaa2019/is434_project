Considering her long-time reputation as an uber-b****, one assumes that Shannen Doherty would make one heck of a Bridezilla.
Yet, the American actress, most famous for her turn on Gen-X hit show Beverly Hills 90210, had no qualms about letting the cameras chronicle her journey to the altar on her latest reality project.
Shannen Says, which premiered on the small screen here late last month, charts the seven weeks leading up to Doherty's third wedding. Its fourth episode will air tomorrow.
Quite refreshingly, it does not force rose-tinted glasses on its viewers. The 41-year-old married photographer Kurt Iswarienko last October.
Indeed, Doherty can come across as abrasive and bossy (read: bitchy), such as when she browbeats the guy into admitting he should not have picked playing football with friends over spending a Sunday morning with her, but she's also extremely honest.
So, sit back and enjoy the various dramas that come with planning so lavish a soiree.
We're pretty sure the "determined" Doherty would simply insist on it.
