Don't ignore me because I'm beautiful.
Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli, who recently shot to the top of Maxim's Hot 100 list, told the men's magazine that she was "shocked that among all these beautiful ladies, I'm No. 1".
She bested the likes of US actresses Olivia Munn and Mila Kunis, who came in second and third respectively.
But the 26-year-old, who used to date Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, told US talk show host Conan O' Brien recently: "Let's put it out there; no one hits on me. No one flirts with me. It's very sad, actually.
"A guy who comes up to me (directly) works. I hope that will happen every now and again."
On her ideal guy, Refaeli said: "I want him to be sweet and kind, with good values and morals.
"But the first thing I notice is his teeth. I have a fetish. He has to have a great smile and really white, bright teeth."
