SAN FRANCISCO - Classic films from iconic US studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on Monday were added to the library of works available for online rental at YouTube and Google Play. MGM became the fifth major movie studio to make films available for viewing at the Google-owned Internet venues, according to a blog post by YouTube content partnerships manager Jonathan Zepp.
'If there's one consistent opening image movie-goers around the world know and equate with great cinema, it's Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's roaring lion,' Mr Zepp said.
'You can now discover, share and watch MGM's classic films on YouTube and Google Play.'
The more than 600 titles being added to YouTube and Google Play rental libraries in Canada and the United States include The Terminator and Rocky along with Rain Man and Moonstruck.
Online movie viewing in the United States is expected to double this year and become the primary method for viewers to watch films, according to IHS Screen Study digest projections cited by Google.
