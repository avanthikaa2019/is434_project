Mozilla Marketplace is currently live, offering users more than 100 applications to install on their desktops with the Firefox 16 Nightly build.
Apps from the store can run on Mac or Windows machines, said technology-news website Engadget. The apps will show up in the user's list of installed programs and can be launched from the Windows Start Menu.
