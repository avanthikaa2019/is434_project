Two Indonesians were brought before a court in Adelaide, South Australia, on Friday for alleged involvement in people smuggling.
During Friday's hearing, Yanto Mulik (37) and Mus Lete (45), were represented by video link from their detention center, kompas.com reported on Saturday.
According to documents that were presented to the court, the pair had smuggled four to five people from Indonesian waters into Australian territory in September. They were remanded for trial in May.
Through their lawyer, both defendants claimed to be innocent.
The trial was moved to Adelaide since the Western Australia court is overwhelmed by people smuggling cases, most of which involve Indonesians.
Almost 500 Indonesians have already been implicated in people smuggling.
