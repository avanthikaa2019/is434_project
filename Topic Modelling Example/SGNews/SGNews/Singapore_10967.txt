SINGAPORE - All outstanding tenders involving former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) commissioner Peter Lim Sin Pang and the persons involved in the alleged corruption scandal have been suspended, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
In a statement to the press, MHA said it took "immediate action" once it was known that Lim was under investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).
MHA said that the companies and the people believed to be involved in the case are no longer servicing the SCDF accounts.
In addition, two contracts that SCDF signed which Lim had been directly involved in the tender process are currently under review.
Lim, 52, has been charged for his alleged sexual trysts with three women in return for giving preferential treatment in the awarding of contracts to their companies.
He faces 10 charges in total. Each charge carries a maximum jail term of five years and a $100,000 fine.
MHA also said that it is doing a review on how to strengthen the integrity of MHA's procurement and tender processes.
This involves the reorganisation of its procurement function as well as the roles and functions of officers involved in the process.
