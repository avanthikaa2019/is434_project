A man apparently high on drugs yesterday held his wife hostage at knifepoint in a sixhour standoff with police. After negotiations had failed, an officer used his Tasergun to stun and arrest the man, whose wife walked away with just minor cut wounds to her neck.
The hostage drama on Rama III Road in Bangkok caused heavy traffic congestion on the road and in nearby areas. Police said the arrested man, Sakdawuth Ngamsiri, 30, went berserk after accusing his wife, Thaywee Naiyanit, 38, of lodging a complaint with police that led to his arrest on Wednesday for allegedly assaulting her in a drunken brawl.
Sakdawuth grabbed a knife and demanded to return to his home province in Si Sa Ket.
After hours of failed negotiation yesterday, police negotiators confronted Sukdawuth, who was holding Thaywee hostage near a traffic island, in order to draw his attention. A SWAT officer then shot him with a Tasergun while he was sitting, causing him to drop the knife and allowing officers to charge in and overpower him.
Sakdawuth, who has a previous arrest for possessing ammunition without a licence, later apologised to his wife and for causing traffic congestion. He has been charged with holding a person against their will with restraint, and (after he tested positive) using drugs.
