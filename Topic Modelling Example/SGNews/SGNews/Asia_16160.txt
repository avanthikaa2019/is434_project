TAIPEI - Taiwan said Monday it was keeping an eye on North Korea's planned rocket launch amid reports the island was deploying air defence systems to shoot down any wreckage that might endanger its people.
"We've ordered the responsible units to collect information on North Korea's plan and to take proper countermeasures so as to ensure the safety of our compatriots," defence ministry spokesman David Lo said.
Several local media have reported in recent days a decision by the ministry to mobilise US-made PAC III anti-missile batteries and home-made Tien Kung (Sky Bow) III air defences for possible emergencies.
A local military expert, who requested anonymity, told AFP the batteries, which are designed to ward off low-altitude threats, would mainly be useful if the North Korean launch fails and debris from the rocket starts raining down from the sky.
Lo declined to comment on the reports, citing a ministry policy of refraining from commenting on military deployments.
Pyongyang announced last month it would launch a rocket between April 12-16 to place a peaceful satellite in orbit, sparking alarm in the region.
The United States and other nations say the planned launch is a disguised ballistic missile test, and would breach a UN ban on North Korean missile launches.
The Philippines said earlier Monday North Korea's planned rocket launch is "unacceptable" and it expected Southeast Asian nations to support its protest against Pyongyang.
In a letter to the UN's International Maritime Organisation, North Korea said the second stage of its latest rocket was expected to splash down 190 kilometres (118 miles) east of the northern Philippines.
The first stage of the rocket would fall about 140 kilometres off South Korea's west coast, in international waters between China and the South, the letter said.
