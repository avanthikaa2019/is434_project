SINGAPORE - After five days of the SEA (Southeast Asia) Swimming Championships, Singapore has emerged as the top-performing country with a total of 32 medals - 16 gold, 11 silver and 13 bronze.
Singapore's top male performer was 15-year-old Quah Zheng Wen who won three gold medals. He also recorded a third-place finish in the men's 50m backstroke. Local sportsgirl of the year Amanda Lim also did well. She won the 50m freestyle with an OGB (Olympic "B") and personal best timing of 25.71 seconds.
The 18-year-old swimmer said: "I'm happy and satisfied as long as there is improvement. I know I've been stagnant for some time, and haven't reached my best timings."
Overall top winners were Vietnam's Nguyen Thi Anh Vien, who came out on top with five golds to her name, and Indonesia's I Gede Siman, who was the competition's top male performer with four first-place finishes.
Nguyen notched her fifth gold medal tonight in the women's 400m individual medley with an OGB timing of 4 minutes and 50.27 seconds. In a competition where she was competing against women much older than her, the 15-year-old won and breached the OGB timing in every event that she swam in - the 200m backstroke, 200m individual medley, 100m backstroke, 50m backstroke, and 400m individual medley.
Speaking through a translator, she said: "My target was to meet the OGB timings for each event, and I'm happy that I did it. Furthermore, before the meet, my only OGB timing was in the 200m backstroke."
Indonesia's Siman, fast cementing his reputation as Southeast Asia's backstroke king, won the 50m backstroke tonight with a timing of 25.67 and recorded a personal best timing in the 100m backstroke (55.32s).
In Day 5's other events, Indonesia's Monaliza Arieswate Lorenza won the women's 200m butterfly, while Christina Loh of Malaysia won the 50m breaststroke. Singapore's Danny Yeo clinched the men's 200m freestyle, and team Indonesia rounded off the championships with a victory in the men's 400m medley relay.
