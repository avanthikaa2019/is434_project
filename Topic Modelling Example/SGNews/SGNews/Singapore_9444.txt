Under the guise of donations, at least $2.1 million was given to City Harvest Church Kuala Lumpur (KL) between December 2007 and May 2010, said the Commissioner of Charities. The funds were transferred by the KL church to support a "Crossover Project" in the United States.
Donations and tithes the church received were transferred to a "multi-purpose account", also used to fund the Crossover Project. Between April 2007 and March 2010, about $600,000 and $3 million from the account was used for Mr Kong Hee and wife Ho Yeow Sun's expenses, respectively. The account was unknown to most church members.
Donations for the church's building fund amounting to $600,000 were transferred to the multi-purpose account for the Crossover Project. To aid in the project, US$100,000 (S$128,000) was used to finance publicity for Ho's music career in the US.
Between 2006 and 2008, Mr Kong's firm sold merchandise worth over $3 million to the church. In 2008, Mr Kong "refunded" $770,000 to the church, concealed as a "sales discount" to the church. The refunds were later reimbursed to him from the multi-purpose account and the KL church.
