SINGAPORE - Twenty young footballers from S-League club Balestier Khalsa got to meet Manchester United icons, Denis Irwin and Paul Parker, at the Hotel Intercontinental on Saturday.
They were the special guests at the official launch of the Maybank Manchester United Platinum Visa Card, an exclusive event for invited card-members.
The children, who are recipients of the Central Singapore Community Development Council's (CDC) Free Kicks programme, mingled with the stars, and had a candid session of table football.
It was a unique opportunity which the children fully enjoyed.
Mohd Shahrulnizam, 15, said: "It's a really interesting event. We don't get to meet these players often, so I really enjoyed it."
Mohd Haikal, 10, said: "I watched them on TV before, so I think it's really cool."
Altogether, it was a vibrant affair attended by United fans of all ages.
Murali Muralitharan, a managing executive of Central Singapore CDC, was also thrilled.
The 33-year-old, who was looking after the children at the event, said: "You can see the joy and fun in the faces of the boys and girls. They love United and they've really got a passion for football as well."
Meanwhile, the Manchester United Concept Shop in Singapore is having a store-wide 20 per cent discount on Monday and Tuesday.
The discount is applicable only for the outlets at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and Citylink Mall.
