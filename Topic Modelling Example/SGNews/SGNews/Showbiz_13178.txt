K-pop group Wonder Girls will release their Japanese debut album "Nobody for Everybody" on July 25, Japan's Oricon said Thursday.
The Japanese version of their hit song "Nobody" is expected to be a highlight of the record.
"In Korea, the Wonder Girls have reached their peak, and now we are ready for a bigger challenge," said Park Jin-young, their record producer.
"We are very excited to meet our Japanese fans," said So-hee, a member of the group. "We are working very hard to show Japan our best."
The Wonder Girls bedazzled Korea in 2007 with the catchy melody and dance moves of their hit "Tell Me." "Tell Me Syndrome" swept over the country, with their addictive music video gaining over a hundred million views on Youtube.
Since then, the girl group has steadily made efforts to enter the international market, starting out with their debut in the United States in 2008.
The girls managed to rank 76th on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest ranking for a Korean artist at the time.
