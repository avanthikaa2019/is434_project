The chief executive of the Esplanade and the National Arts Council (NAC) has been diagnosed with lymphoma.
A joint statement from both organisations yesterday said that Mr Benson Puah, 55, was diagnosed last Thursday with the form of cancer which begins in the immune system cells or lymphocytes.
He began a 16-week treatment for the condition yesterday. Mr Puah, who is married with no children, will continue with his duties at the Esplanade and the NAC as "normally as his condition will allow him to do so".
The statement added: "Operations at Esplanade and NAC will continue...as usual." Mr Puah has headed the NAC, Singapore's statutory board for promoting and developing the arts, since 2009. He was appointed chief executive of the Esplanade in 1998.
Prior to that, he had been chief executive of Sentosa Development Corporation from 1995 to 1997. He was executive assistant manager of The Oriental, Singapore from 1984 to 1988, and became the first general manager of Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort in 1992.
