Using meteorological radar to track insects and spiders carried by wind, a team of researchers has observed the formation of thunderclouds, it has been learned.
The findings by the researchers, including some from the Meteorological Agency's Meteorological Research Institute (MRI), may lead to technology that will allow meteorologists to predict the generation of cumulonimbus clouds, the researchers said.
Cumulonimbus clouds produce thunder- storms, and sometimes tornadoes.
Thunderclouds are spawned when an ascending current is generated at a place where cool air meets warmer air carried in winds blowing from different directions.
Using a meteorological radar system installed at Haneda Airport, the research group observed insects and other tiny creatures floating about 500 meters above the ground in western Tokyo on the afternoon of Aug. 7, 2011.
The bugs, which the researchers said probably included Mymaridae bees and spiders, were believed to be buoyed by winds at a place where cool wind from Tokyo Bay converged with warm wind on land.
The study group subsequently confirmed the formation of thunderclouds directly above the site while tracking the bugs, mostly about one millimeter across, as they were carried into the sky on columns of air, the team said.
