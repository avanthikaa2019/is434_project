US - Secret diaries of an Australian woman who was one of young United States President Barack Obama's girlfriends, show the warmth and trust of the future leader in love, but also hint at his reserve and "coolness".
Accounts of the 1980s romance between Ms Genevieve Cook and a twenty-something Obama in New York were excerpted in Vanity Fair magazine from a forthcoming book, titled Barack Obama: The Story, by author David Maraniss.
Ms Cook, daughter of an Australian diplomat, remembered how "on Sundays Obama would lounge around, drinking coffee and solving the New York Times crossword puzzle, bare-chested, wearing a blue-and-white sarong", Maraniss wrote.
The book also includes accounts from Ms Cook's diaries, which show how the romance grew and then cooled when the couple moved in together, according to excerpts published in Vanity Fair.
"The sexual warmth is definitely there - but the rest of it has sharp edges and I'm finding it all unsettling and finding myself wanting to withdraw from it all," Ms Cook wrote.
The account by Maraniss shows the young Obama trying to make sense of the different cultural and racial strands of his life, as the son of a white American woman and a Kenyan father who spent boyhood years in Indonesia.
He comes across as cerebral, searching, perhaps pretentious, brooding but earnest.
"His warmth can be deceptive," Ms Cook wrote. "He speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness."
