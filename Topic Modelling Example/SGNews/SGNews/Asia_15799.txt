BEIJING - United States ambassador to China Gary Locke, who has repeatedly won the praise of Chinese for his frugal travelling habits, has again impressed after refusing to stay in a five-star hotel.
In a country where officials keenly show off their wealth, Locke's simple habits, like carrying his own luggage or flying economy class, are regularly reported by a media increasingly critical of their leaders' extravagance.
During a stay at China's resort island of Hainan last week, Locke, dubbed &ldquo;the backpacker&rdquo; by Chinese web users, turned down the five-star rooms of the Sofitel Hotel for less posh accommodations, the Global Times said.
Locke's move to a four-star hotel came as world leaders and policy-makers opted for the plush Sofitel during the Boao Forum, an elite conference which discusses global economic issues.
Locke's choice won immediate plaudits on Chinese microblogs.
This case &ldquo;illustrates the lack of regulatory supervision of our officials when they travel on business trips which leads to a waste of public money,&rdquo; said Chuanyude Angle on Sina's Weibo microblog.
Sung Zude, a television presenter known for being particularly outspoken raised the possibility that Locke's choice of hotel was nothing but a marketing stunt.
But he added on his blog that Locke's behaviour, &ldquo;so unique in China,&rdquo; was &ldquo;giving officials a headache.&rdquo;
Last summer Locke, a former US commerce secretary, seduced the Chinese public with his &ldquo;guy next door&rdquo; attitude when he was photographed with his daughter carrying a backpack and queuing for coffee.
The picture was seen by millions of Chinese Internet users.
