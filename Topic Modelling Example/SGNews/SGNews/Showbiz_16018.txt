V3 Melodi hostess Khaidhirah Abu Zahar, popularly known as Dira, has denied that she was the celebrity who stepped on a woman's face at an entertainment outlet, reported Utusan Malaysia.
Claiming that she had absolutely no knowledge of such an incident, Dira said the rumours were false.
"I don't know why my name has been linked to this case. I was shopping with my family on the night of the incident, so it is impossible that I am the celebrity involved," said the 28-year-old.
It was reported that a popular gossip programme hostess had allegedly attacked a woman during a birthday party at the outlet by stepping on her face with her high heels.
Several groups had since accused Dira as the one responsible.
However, Dira, who is the wife of the programme's photography director, claimed that she did not even like to wear high heels.
"A few of my friends called me to ask about the incident. They were unsure about my involvement because they know that I do not like to wear high heels," she said.
