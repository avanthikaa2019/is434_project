WASHINGTON - The United States on Thursday released 17 documents found at Osama Bin Laden's Pakistani compound in the raid that killed the Al-Qaeda chief a year ago.
The White House allowed the declassified documents to be published online by the Combating Terrorism Center at the West Point military academy. The papers include letters or draft letters dated from September 2006 to April 2011, a total of 175 pages in the original Arabic.
The documents reveal internal correspondence inside the Al-Qaeda network, including letters authored by Bin Laden and leaders of the group's affiliate in Yemen and fellow militants in Somalia and Pakistan.
The release of the documents were part of a nearly week-long commemoration of the anniversary of the bin Laden killing, with President Barack Obama and his deputies recounting in interviews the secret nighttime raid by US Navy SEALS that killed the Al-Qaeda mastermind.
