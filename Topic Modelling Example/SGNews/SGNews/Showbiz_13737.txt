TRAIN
California 37 (Sony)
THE American roots-rock band which brought you hit song Drops Of Jupiter have found a new lease of life lately, especially since comeback single Hey, Soul Sister blew up in 2010.
On their sixth album, the trio attempt a younger, fresher sound (and almost dance floor-ready beats), with varying results. Subdued soft-rock numbers like Feels Good At First work infinitely better.
