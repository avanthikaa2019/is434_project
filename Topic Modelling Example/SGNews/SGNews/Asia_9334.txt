Giant panda Shin Shin at the Ueno Zoo may be pregnant, the Tokyo zoological park said Tuesday.
"There is a high chance of pregnancy," Yutaka Fukuda, deputy head of the zoo, said.
As the 6-year-old female has started to show signs of being pregnant, such as hormonal and physical changes, the zoo decided to suspend the public viewing of the animal from July 3.
If Shin Shin is confirmed to be pregnant, her baby is expected to be born in July or August.
According to the zoo, Shin Shin lost her appetite in early June. A blood test conducted June 19 showed rises in hormonal levels, a sign of pregnancy.
If a baby panda is born, it will be the first in 24 years at the zoo.
Giant pandas have a 45 per cent chance of giving birth to twins. But in many cases, only one of the two babies can survive unless there is human intervention.
The zoo will prepare for the birth of twins with new cages and incubators.
