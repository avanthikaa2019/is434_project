Howard Shaw recently appeared on the cover of a high-society magazine with his wife in an article about enduring love stories.
Yesterday, the grandson of Shaw founder Runme Shaw was in court with his wife, Jessie Xue, to be charged for paying for sex with an underage girl.
According to The Straits Times, Shaw and his wife were married in November 2011 after a six year courtship.
They met during a Miss Earth pageant where he was training and judging contestants.
The New Paper said he was attracted to her intelligent replies during the question-and-answer segment. In turn, she was struck by his gentle nature.
Madam Xue, 26, appeared to be a source of comfort to Shaw while he was in court, tapping his hand gently and lovingly with her fingers.
He also rested his head on her shoulder before the court proceedings.
She left quietly by herself after Shaw was charged.
He faces one charge of paying the underage prostitute $500 for sex on Oct 30, 2010 at Hotel 81 Bencoolen on Bencoolen Street. His case will be heard on June 18.
She told The Straits Times she was "very sad" about the whole affair but declined to comment further.
