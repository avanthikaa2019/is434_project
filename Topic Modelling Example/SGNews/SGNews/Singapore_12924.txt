A pimp who brought in Thai women for vice activities and lived off their earnings was jailed 35 months on Monday.
Tan Meng Chee, 50, received the women at Golden Mile Complex and also managed a contact point for prostitution in 2010 and 2011.
He was arrested in April this year at Lorong 20 Geylang. Vice agents in Thailand arranged for the women to come to Singapore to work as prostitutes, and Tan lived on their earnings.
The women were to serve 20 to 80 clients without payment. Subsequently, they would earn $15 out of $26 for sexual services with clients.
