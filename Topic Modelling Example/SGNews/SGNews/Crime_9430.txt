PETALING JAYA - Former beauty queen Dawn Jeremiah almost became a victim of a snatch thief outside a shopping mall in Mutiara Damansara.
According to her Facebook posting, she had just finished watching a movie on Monday night and was walking back to her car.
"The alleyway that we had to walk past wasn't dark and it hardly looked menacing. But it was deserted," she wrote. A man appeared and grabbed the strap of her handbag.
"I screamed at the top of my lungs and yanked my handbag back."
The thief then ran away, she said.
Petaling Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Arjunaidi Mohamed confirmed that a police report had been lodged.
