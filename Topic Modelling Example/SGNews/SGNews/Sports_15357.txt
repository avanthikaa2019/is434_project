CHESTER - English Premier League club Chelsea will take on Major League Soccer's All-Stars in the US league's annual exhibition on July 25, MLS announced Wednesday.
The match comes six years after a select side of MLS stars shocked Chelsea 1-0 in the 2006 All-Star game at Chicago.
This time around, the match will be held at PPL Park, home of the Philadelphia Union.
It will be the second stop on Chelsea's US visit, following the announcement last month that they will play the Sounders in Seattle on July 18.
The MLS All-Stars will be coached by Peter Nowak, current coach of the Union. Nowak was at the helm when Dwayne De Rosario's goal gave MLS the victory over Chelsea in 2006.
Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said the English club were excited to have a chance at a re-match.
Chelsea have played in Philadelphia before, taking on AC Milan there in 2004.
