BUKIT MERTAJAM, Malaysia - The case of a couple charged with murdering their Cambodian maid will be mentioned at the magistrate's court here on July 5.
Magistrate Chan Kian Hong yesterday fixed the new mention date as the chemist reports were not ready.
Hardware trader Soh Chew Tong, 43, and his wife, Chin Chui Ling, 41, are charged with murdering Mey Sichan, 24, at their house in Taman Asas Murni here between Jan 1 and April 1.
Sichan had been working for the couple for several months when she was found dead on March 31, allegedly due to prolonged starvation.
It was reported that she weighed 26kg, which was almost half a healthy woman's weight, and had injuries on her body, leading police to believe that she was also abused.
Deputy public prosecutor Nurdeenie Abdul Rashid prosecuted while counsel R. Rajendran represented the couple.
About 10 people, believed to be the couple's family members, were seen in the court's public gallery.
When Soh and Chin arrived in court earlier, a man tried to block pressmen who were trying to take pictures of the couple by waving his arms in the air.
