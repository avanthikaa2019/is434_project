SINGAPORE - Police have arrested a 59-year-old Chinese male and three Chinese youths aged between 15 and 16 for operating an illegal gaming stall.
The group was operating a make-shift stall playing a game of chance at the back lane of Desker Road when they were discovered by the police around 8pm on Sunday.
Gaming paraphernalia which included the dice holder, make-shift table and cash amounting to $380 were seized as evidence.
Preliminary investigations revealed that one of the youths was the game operator, while the second posed as a player to attract the attention of passersby to place bets on the game. The third youth and the 59-year-old acted as look-outs.
The game involves using a dice holder to toss a dice with three of its sides painted blue and the other three in red. Players will place bets on either one of the colours. In most of such cases however, the dice is often modified to allow the illegal gaming operator to determine the outcome of the game at his will to maximise the winnings.
All four suspects have been released on Police bail pending investigations. If found guilty, they face a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and imprisonment for a term of up to 5 years. As for the players, any person convicted of gaming in public shall be liable to a fine of up to $5,000, or imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both.
Commander of Central Police Division, Assistant Commissioner of Police (AC) Tan Hung Hooi said that the police takes a serious view of illegal gaming activities and will continue to conduct strict enforcement against such illicit activities. AC Tan also reminded parents to be mindful of their children's activities to ensure that they do not fall prey to unscrupulous criminals.
