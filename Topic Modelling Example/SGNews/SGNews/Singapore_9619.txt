A record total of 1,927 NSmen and their families participated in the third edition of SAFRA Sprint Kids this year.
This year's event also saw twice as many father-and-child pairs joining the non-competitive Dads For Life Hand-In-Hand Sprint category as compared to the year before.
A total of 560 pairs turned up at Parkway Parade on Sunday, June 24, to sprint along a specially created 40-meter lane.
Organised by SAFRA Jurong, this is the second time that the event has featured a special category for fathers and their children to participate together as part of SAFRA's partnership with the Dads for Life Movement to promote active fathering among NSmen.
They sprinted together with finalists of the event's four other competitive categories from six to nine years old.
This event is part of SAFRA's eight-month long 40th Anniversary celebrations aimed at strengthening bonds among NSmen as well as their families.
The event was graced by Guest-of-Honour Dr Maliki Osman, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and Deputy President of SAFRA, who presented the prizes to the winners of the competitive categories.
Mr Lim Chong Lee, Club Manager of SAFRA Jurong, commented, "We are very encouraged to see more NSman fathers making the effort to spend quality time with their kids at SAFRA Sprint Kids."
