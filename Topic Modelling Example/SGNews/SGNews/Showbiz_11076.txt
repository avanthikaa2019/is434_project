Yuichi Takaso, the ex-husband of former actress Noriko Sakai, has been arrested on suspicion of drug possession after his father tipped off police, it was learned Wednesday.
According to a senior Metropolitan Police Department officer, Takaso, 44, possessed about 11.7 milliliters of liquid containing the narcotic AMT at his home in Minato Ward, Tokyo, on April 9.
Takaso's father, who lives with him, contacted the police that day after a package delivered to his son aroused his suspicions.
"A strange parcel was sent to our house, and I suspect my son might be using drugs again," he reportedly told the police.
The MPD analyzed a small bottle of the liquid in the parcel and detected narcotic ingredients in it. Police arrested Takaso at a friend's condominium in Onjuku, Chiba Prefecture, on Monday. He is suspected of violating the Narcotic Control Law.
