SINGAPORE - The registration for Primary One (P1) admission in 2013 will open from July 3, 2012.
The Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the cohort size for 2013 is comparable to that of 2012, assuring parents that "there will be sufficient school places for all eligible P1 students on a regional and nationwide basis".
From this year's registration exercise, MOE also said that when balloting is necessary, Singapore Citizens will be given absolute priority over Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs), before home-school distance is considered.
When picking their school of choice, parents can consider one of the seven new primary schools - namely Palm View Primary, Punggol Green Primary, Punggol View Primary, Sengkang Green Primary, Springdale Primary, Riverside Primary and Westwood Primary - which will be taking in students from 2013 and open for P1 registration this year.
Parents also should note that six primary schools will be relocating to and operating from their temporary locations in 2013. These include Canossa Convent Primary School, CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh), Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, Nanyang Primary School, St. Anthony's Primary School and St. Hilda's Primary School.
This year, the MOE will also introduce the Primary One Internet System (P1-IS) in 42 Primary Schools to to facilitate the process of registration during Phase 2C and 2C Supplementary.
During the registration period, all primary schools will open for registration from 8 am to 11 am and from 2.30 pm to 4.30 pm from Mondays to Fridays.
Registration closes on August 31, 2012.
International students, who were born between January 2, 2006, and January 1, 2007, may apply to the school of choice during Phase 3 of the registration exercise.
Parents can go online to register using their SingPass accounts to access the 24-hour P1-IS service.
Registration for Phase 2C starts from 9am on July 27 to 4.30pm on July 31.
For Phase 2C Supplementary, application begins from 9am on August 10 to 4.30pm on August 14.
Parents who do not wish to make an online registration for these 42 schools can still have the option of going to their school of choice to register personally.
