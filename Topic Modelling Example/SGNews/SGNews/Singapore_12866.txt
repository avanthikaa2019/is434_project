iFly Singapore has announced that it will host the first indoor skydiving world championships in the Asia Pacific region.
It will be held in the world's largest wind tunnel facility on Sentosa Island.
This will be the first time that a competition on this scale is held in the Asia Pacific region.
Up to 400 flyers worldwide are expected to compete in professional and amateur categories during the four-day event which will take place from December 13 to December 16 this year.
Team Firefly will be one of Singapore's representatives in the professional category. 10-year-old Kyra Poh and 11-year-old Choo Yixuan have been training at iFly Singapore for over a year and can even execute tough manoeuvres, such as flying in the head-down position.
Cash and prizes worth $150,000 will be up for grabs at the competition. Registration for the event will open in the second half of this year.
