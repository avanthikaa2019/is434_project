KLANG, Malaysia - A 26-year-old woman has claimed that she was repeatedly abused by her husband during their four-year marriage.
The woman, who only wanted to be known as Ching, alleged that she was beaten up by her 30-year-old husband with a baseball bat almost every time they got into heated arguments.
"He was nice when we first got married but as time went by, he changed. There were times when he tried to strangle me with a blanket and use a pillow to suffocate me.
"He once threatened to kill me and my family if I mentioned the beatings to others," she said at the Klang MCA office yesterday.
She added that she had lodged three police reports against him.
Ching said she moved into her mother's house, also in Klang, last September after she could no longer take her husband's torture.
"We argued over petty issues like other couples. But our fights became very physical until I had to seek treatment at the hospital several times," she said.
Showing photographs of bruises that she suffered on her face, hands and legs, Ching said she hoped MCA would help her.
Klang MCA Youth chief Ching Eu Boon said he had spoken to the husband, but the latter told him to deal with his lawyer instead.
The division Youth chief said he would also follow up with the police regarding the reports, as well as contact the Women, Family and Community Development Ministry to seek a suitable course of action.
He also advised abuse victims to contact the Talian Nur hotline at 15999.
