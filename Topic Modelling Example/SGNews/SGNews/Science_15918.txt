Sin Chew Daily reported about a Taiwanese man who "lost" the use of his index finger after playing games on his touch-screen smartphone for up to six hours each day.
The paper said the finger had stiffened because the cartilage between the joints had weakened.
He said he would feel excruciating pain each time he tried to bend the finger.
Five months of physiotherapy had also failed to improve his condition.
He is facing difficulty in writing, holding objects and carrying out chores.
The man has vowed never to play games on his mobile phone again.
