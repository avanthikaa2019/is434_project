Coffee shops and retailers selling tobacco products in the Marsiling constituency in Woodlands will soon get a visit from students from neighbouring secondary schools.
The 50 students are health ambassadors recruited by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), and they will bear the message: Do not sell cigarettes to underage smokers - anyone under the age of 18.
They are part of a new HPB programme called "What Youth Can Do", aimed at encouraging students to reach out to the community to spread the message.
These students will also volunteer their time at the Marsiling Community Centre, taking part in exercise sessions with residents or helping out at health check-ups, such as by measuring height and weight.
The initiative was launched at Marsiling Community Club yesterday, with the student volunteers coming from four secondary schools in the Marsiling constituency - Fuchun, Marsiling, Siling and Woodlands.
There are plans to roll out the programme to all secondary schools by 2015, recruiting 1,000 student ambassadors.
Said Mr Hawazi Daipi, MP for Sembawang GRC's Marsiling division and adviser to Marsiling grassroots organisations: "One of the goals is to tap the energy and passion of youth...living in Marsiling to inspire the Marsiling community to live healthily."
Beyond promoting healthier living in the community, the programme is also about grooming the youth and getting them involved in community work at a young age.
