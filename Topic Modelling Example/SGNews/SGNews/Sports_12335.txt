A comical video clip of a seemingly old man taking on young basketball players is entertaining hundreds of thousands online.
In this video, "uncle Drew," is asked by his "nephew" to play in place of an injured player during a pick-up basketball game.
After air-balling first couple of shots, uncle Drew starts draining threes, crossing over opponents before finally throwing an alley-oop pass to himself and throwing it down.
"Too easy out here against these young buds," boasts uncle Drew.
Spectators can only gape in disbelief.
But near the end of the video, it turns out that uncle Drew is actually a disguised form of Kyrie Irving, a 20-year-old rookie prodigy in the NBA.
The video was produced by Pepsi as part of its promotion of "a zero-calorie cola in disguise" slogan.
