BRITNEY Spears' fiance, Jason Trawick, has filed papers asking to be added as one of the singer's conservators. If approved, Trawick, 40, will have "control over her well-being", said Us Magazine.
Her father, Jamie, will retain full control over her finances, the magazine added. He has held legal control over his daughter, 30, and her finances since 2008.
