WASHINGTON - Twenty-two per cent of Americans think veteran rocker Bruce Springsteen should compose a new US national anthem to replace "The Star-Spangled Banner," suggests an online poll released Monday.
That's more than the 19 per cent who think country legend Dolly Parton is up to the task, or the 18 per cent who favor soulman Stevie Wonder, according to the poll for the CBS current affairs show "60 Minutes" and Vanity Fair magazine.
Eleven per cent named venerable singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, 10 per cent favor movie soundtrack composer John Williams, eight per cent voted for rapper Jay-Z and five per cent named pop diva Madonna.
Pollsters telephoned a random sample of 1,026 adults nationwide between April 27 and 30 for the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Based on a poem by Francis Scott Key describing the British naval bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland during the War of 1812, "The Star-Spangled Banner" has been the official US national anthem since 1931.
