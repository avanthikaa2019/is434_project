KOTA KINABALU - Seven construction workers took a risk and climbed a tower crane to escape from Immigration officers at a construction site, near Jalan Tanjung Lipat here, yesterday.
They stayed at the top of the crane, which is about 12 stories high, for four hours before climbing down and eluding arrest after the officers got fed up and left the scene.
The workers, with no travel documents, scaled up the crane in a state of panic at 10.30am during Ops Mahir, conducted by the state Immigration Department.
It is learnt that several Immigration officers had tried to persuade them to climb down the crane, but to no avail.
The officers then left the construction site at 2.30pm and the seven took the opportunity to descend and flee the site.
During the raid, three workers jumped into a river, which connects to the sea nearby, in an attempt to escape.
However, the trio were nabbed by marine police who rushed to the scene upon being alerted by the Immigration.
According to state Immigration director Mohammad Mentek, the team picked up 47 people, aged between 4 and 60, for failing to produce valid travel documents.
The operation involved 25 Immigration officers and was assisted by 41 People's Volunteer Corps (Rela) personnel.
"We inspected 104 construction workers and found 34 of them without documents.
"All detainees will be remanded at the Immigration Department for further investigations," Mohammad said.
