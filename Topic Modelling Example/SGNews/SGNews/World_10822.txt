BEIRUT - At least 14,115 people, the majority civilians, have been killed in Syria since the start of the revolt against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday.
They comprised 9,862 civilians, 3,470 soldiers and 783 army deserters, the Britain-based watchdog said.
The Observatory counts rebel fighters who are not deserters from the army as civilians.
The violence has intensified in Syria despite the presence of 300 United Nations observers charged with monitoring a truce that was supposed to take effect from April 12.
On Saturday, at least 111 people - 83 civilians and 28 soldiers - were killed, according to revised figures from the Observatory, representing one of the heaviest single-day death tolls since the nominal start of the ceasefire.
