KOTA KINABALU - It was the best gift that Ricardo Stanley Faurillo could receive as he watched his eldest daughter being crowned the new Miss Earth Sabah.
Joanna Marie Faurillo, 20, charmed the audience with her beauty and intelligence during the pageant's grand final yesterday.
The petite beauty also grabbed three subsidiary titles -- Miss Sutera Facebook Favourite, Miss Talent and Miss Natural Beauty. Faurillo, 53, described his daughter's victory as the perfect Fathers Day gift.
"Watching her on stage was amazing. I could not stop smiling and we are so proud of her.
"Her involvement in this pageant has helped us to understand something about the environment and we will support her in her fight against environmental destruction."
During the question-and-answer session, the 1.6m tall Joanna confidently described her views on reducing the use of plastic bags and her vision to expand the "No plastic campaign".
Joanna, who did not expect to win, said she would strive to be a good "green ambassador" and role model to society. She added that she would foster the "love for the environment" in her family.
Deidre Ann Walker, 18, was the first runner-up while the second runner-up was Grace Chang Siew Ling, who also won two subsidiary titles (Miss Eco Giant and Miss Creative Eco Costume).
Pageant organising director and Miss Earth Malaysia 2009 Madelyne M. Nandu was happy with the results, adding that all finalists were winners in the competition.
"Those who did not win, I hope they won't give up and make this opportunity and knowledge gained as their platform and starting point to get involved in serving society."
