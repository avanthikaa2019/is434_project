Veteran soul singer Lionel Richie knocked Nicki Minaj off the top spot on the Billboard chart on Wednesday as his country album Tuskegee made the rare climb to No. 1, three weeks after its release.
It is uncommon for albums to climb to the top position in weeks following their release.
Most chart-toppers tend to debut at No. 1, but sales for Tuskegee remained steady since it entered the chart late last month at No. 2.
