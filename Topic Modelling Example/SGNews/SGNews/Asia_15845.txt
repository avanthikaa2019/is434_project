A Taichung court yesterday upheld a ruling sentencing a man to 30 years in prison for raping and molesting 12 schools girls more than 1,000 times since 2006.
The man, the 46-year-old owner of an after-class cram school, allegedly raped one of the girls more than 100 times and molested another more than 300 times. The man, identified by his last name Wang, also doubled as the driver of the cram school's van to pick up and take home students.
According to investigators, Wang raped or molested the girls in the van, a classroom in the cram school's basement, or in the school's projection room during class breaks.
Frightened of him, the girls did not tell their parents or teachers what was happening in the school. According to investigators, the man also told the girls if they let their parents or teachers know, he would be sentenced to death and they would be tried in a juvenile court.
In 2010, one of the victims, feeling an excruciating pain after being raped, asked her mother questions about sex, whereupon the mother said promiscuity could lead to sexually transmitted diseases. Worried that she might catch such diseases, the girl informed one of her teachers everything, leading to the man's arrest.
Wang, found guilty of committing a total of 1,010 counts of juvenile rape and sexual molestation, would have been sentenced to more than 4,000 years behind bars if the law required he serve his sentences consecutively. The maximum sentence for people convicted of such heinous crimes is 30 years of imprisonment.
After his arrest, Wang confessed to some of his crimes. During his first trial, however, he denied others, claiming it was "the girls' imagination."
He was first tried by a lower court, which sentenced him to 30 years of imprisonment. Wang appealed to the Taichung Branch of the Taiwan High Court, which saw no reason to overturn the first trial's verdict.
