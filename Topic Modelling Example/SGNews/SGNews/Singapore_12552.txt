SINGAPORE - The Workers' Party (WP) held the first by-election rally on Saturaday, May 19, at the open field in front of Blk 837, bounded by Hougang Ave 4 and Hougang Central.
The rally started at 7pm and ended before 10pm. By 7.30pm, a crowd numbering about 10,000 people had gathered, Channel News Asia reported.
MP Faisal Manap told the crowd that the Workers' Party are not against the current immigration policies rather they believe in putting the interests of Singaporeans first.
WP's chairman and Aljunied MP Sylvia Lim then took to the stage to give a passionate speech reminding Hougang voters that since 1991 they have had no upgrading and bus routes to Hougang were cut.
In what seemed to be a reference to Yaw Shin Leong, MP Pritam Singh claimed that no amount of background checks can ensure a politician is fit for public service.
Party chief Low Thia Khiang, the last to speak at the rally, called on voters to support WP and vote for its candidate Png Eng Huat on May 26.
