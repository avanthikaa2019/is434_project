TOKYO - World silver medallist Ryosuie Irie from Japan booked his place in the London Olympics after winning the men's 200-metre backstroke at the National championships in Tokyo on Saturday.
The 22-year-old Irie, who will compete in his second Olympics, clocked one minute 54.03 seconds to beat Kazuki Watanaber, who came second in 1:56:83, and Yuki Shirai who took third spot in 1:57.60.
"I'm glad that I qualified for it, following to the 100m, but my time was so slow, I must improve it to 52.00 by this summer," said Irie.
"I really want to live up to the expectations and get the best result in the London Olympics," he added.
Kosuke Hagino and Ken Takakuwa in the men's 200m individual medley, and Satomi Suzuki and Kanato Watanabe in the women's 200m breaststroke also qualified for the 2012 Games taking place in London.
Hagino clocked 1:58.91 to beat Ken Talaliwa into second, while Suzuki timed 2:22.99 to beat Kanako Watanabe.
