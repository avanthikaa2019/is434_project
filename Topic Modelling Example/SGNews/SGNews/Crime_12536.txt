The police have arrested two 15-year-old boys over a suspected arson case.
On Sunday at about 6.30pm, the police were told that someone had set fire to discarded items along the common corridor of an HDB block at Kim Tian Road.
A styrofoam box on the 25th-storey common corridor had been set alight.
The fire was put out by residents before the police and Singapore Civil Defence Force officers arrived.
No damage was done and the suspects were described as two teenage boys who fled the scene soon after.
Officers from the Central Police Division identified the two suspects and arrested them about 45 minutes later.
The boys have been released on bail and investigations are ongoing.
Anyone convicted of mischief by fire can be jailed up to seven years, and can also be fined.
