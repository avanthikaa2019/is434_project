HDB said it is aware of the queues at the Changi Staging Ground (CSG) and has been taking measures to alleviate the situation.
For example, it lengthened CSG's operation hours in January last year, from 8am to 7.30pm previously, to 7.30am to 9.30pm from Mondays to Saturdays. Operating hours on Sundays are from 8am to 5pm.
It also added facilities such as a larger queue area, and increased the number of weighing bridges to improve traffic flow within CSG.
HDB said it will also notify users as soon as longer queues are observed, to ask them to spread out deliveries and to encourage more deliveries during the off-peak hours.
The CSG, which opened in 2001, receives excavated material from construction sites islandwide. This is to prevent illegal dumping, which are unsightly and may have an environmental impact.
Previously, the average time required for lorry drivers to deliver and unload their materials at CSG was about 45 minutes.
But with the increase in construction activity and volume of excavated materials, the turn-around time has increased to about 1 1/2 hours.
There have also been occasions where, due to bad weather and lorry bunching, the time taken to unload at CSG went up to about 2 1/2 hours, a HDB spokesman said.
But operations during the non-peak periods are generally smooth, he said, adding that they would continue to monitor the situation closely.
