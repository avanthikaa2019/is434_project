Actress Rita Rudaini, involved in a custody battle with national footballer Mohamad Aidil Zafuan Abdul Razak, said it does not tire her to keep going to court for the sake of her two sons.
"I am willing to go through long periods in and out of the court for my children. Allah gives me and my family that strength," she said outside the Lower Syariah Court in Petaling Jaya on Monday.
The Malay papers and tabloids reported yesterday that the 36-year-old actress had filed a preliminary objection at the court against her estranged husband's application last month ordering her to be loyal to him or be deemed nusyuz (recalcitrant).
Syarie judge Wan Mahyuddin Wan Muhammad fixed July 9 to mention Rita's application, after representatives from both sides sought to defer the case.
On May 15, Mohamad Aidil, 25, had filed an order to get the actress and their two sons Airit Rayyan Rizqin, four, and Airit Qaqa Arjuna, one to return and live at his home in USJ1, Subang Jaya.
He also retracted his filing for a divorce, on the grounds he wanted to reconcile.
Rita and Mohamad Aidil had married in Songkhla, Thailand, on Feb 28, 2008.
