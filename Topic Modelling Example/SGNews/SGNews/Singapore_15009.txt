The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is looking at introducing a dedicated set of regulations to improve on existing ones for ensuring the safety of those who work at heights.
This was revealed yesterday by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Manpower Hawazi Daipi at a forum organised by MOM and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council. It was held at Suntec City Convention Centre.
Mr Hawazi said that the possible new rules could include "mandating fall-prevention plans for all workplaces, and extending the permit-to-work system".
The system, which applies to scaffolding operations, is meant to ensure that hazardous work is allowed to commence only after the work environment and conditions have been assessed.
He added: "If every workplace takes steps to effectively address the risks of working at heights, we will be able to prevent needless accidents."
Public consultation on the regulations will begin within the next three months. Last year, 26 workers died from falls, accounting for about 40 per cent of all workplace fatalities.
Falls from heights killed 17. Of this 17, nine fell from either roofs or ladders.
The WSH Council said it will roll out a slew of initiatives, such as guidebooks which highlight safe practices, and training courses across all levels, for workers, supervisors and managers.
