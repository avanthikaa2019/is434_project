NEW YORK - Jermaine Paul of Team Blake won TV singing contest "The Voice" on Tuesday night, taking home a recording contract with Universal Republic Records, a US$100,000(S$125,000) cash prize and a shot at his dream of singing stardom.
Paul collapsed into a hug from his coach Blake Shelton and wiped away tears as he thanked his wife, children, and all of the people who voted for him, ending his speech by exclaiming"nobody but Jesus!"
He received embraces from his family as he sang "I Believe I Can Fly" to close out the show.
"The Voice" became one of the most-watched TV shows in the United States earlier this season, and was seen a challenge to Fox's top-rated singing show "American Idol."
