The best units across the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) were honoured today.
The Army's 1st Commando Battalion emerged as the Best Combat Unit.
This is the ninth consecutive year that the 1st Commando Battalion has bagged the Best Combat Unit award, and an impressive record 26 wins by the unit since the competition was introduced in 1969.
The Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF's) 145 Squadron won the Best Fighter Squadron.
This year marks 145 Squadron's first win since operating the F-16D BLK 52+ multi-role fighter aircraft in 2004.
The Best Ship award went to the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN's) RSS Valiant.
While RSS Valiant has won the Best Ship award twice in 1993 and 1998, this year marks the first time an upgraded Victory-Class Missile Corvette (MCV) has won the award.
The annual SAF Best Unit and Best NS Unit Competitions were introduced in 1969 and 1993 respectively to recognise units which have excelled in the areas of combat readiness, operational proficiency and administrative excellence.
The units are evaluated based on a rigorous and wide-ranging process over the past year.
The competitions also serve to strengthen key values such as mission excellence, professionalism and camaraderie among servicemen in SAF.
