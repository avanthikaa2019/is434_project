YANGON - A court in Myanmar on Tuesday sentenced a 33-year-old man to death over a series of bomb blasts in Yangon in April 2010 that killed 10 people and wounded dozens more, his lawyer said.
A special court inside Insein prison convicted Phyo Wai Aung on seven charges including plotting to kill, said Kyaw Hoe.
"We're not satisfied with the final verdict as it is not true. We will appeal for him," the lawyer told AFP. "His health condition is not so good as he has liver problems."
According to Amnesty International, no death row prisoner in Myanmar is known to have been executed since 1988.
A year ago, Myanmar's new quasi-civilian government commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment.
The 2010 attack - the worst in five years in Myanmar's main city - came as thousands of people gathered for water-throwing festivities to mark the Buddhist New Year.
Myanmar's police announced shortly afterwards they had arrested a suspect who they said was a member of a militant exile group called "the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors".
Myanmar has been hit by a string of bomb blasts in recent years which the junta has blamed on armed exile groups or ethnic rebels. In May 2005, blasts at two Yangon supermarkets and a convention centre killed 23 people.
