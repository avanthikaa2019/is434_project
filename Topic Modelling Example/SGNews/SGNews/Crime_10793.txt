KUALA LUMPUR - Police have arrested a man believed to be involved in the abduction and robbery of 51-year-old teacher Teoh Soo Kim, who remains in critical condition.
Serdang OCPD Supt Abdul Razak Elias said the special task force set up to investigate the case had picked up the 48-year-old man in Taman Mas Falim, Ipoh, at 11pm on Saturday.
"We are bringing him back here for questioning," he said, adding that the man would be placed under remand today.
Police had released photographs of two men behind the abduction.
They were identified through a CCTV footage retrieved from a petrol station near Puncak Jalil.
Teoh, who was seriously injured, is still in a medically-induced coma at Sungai Buloh Hospital.
She was brutally beaten up and dumped at the Talang oil palm estate in Kuala Selangor.
Her family said they were still praying for her recovery.
"We only want her to regain her strength sufficiently so we can take her home," said her husband, sales executive Tan Lee Ming, 48.
It was reported that police were on the hunt for two men believed to be part of a syndicate that was preying on women.
Teoh went missing after leaving her house in Bandar Kinrara 2 at 7am on Wednesday to pick up a student up for class.
She was found unconscious by passers-by at 11am the same day.
Those with information on the case are urged to contact 03-8074 2222 or the nearest police station.
