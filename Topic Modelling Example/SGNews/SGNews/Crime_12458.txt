HE CONSPIRED with a then-colleague to stage a break-in at their workplace to steal an office safe containing $45,000 in cash.
For committing the offence, Tan Tien Poh, 31, who was an assistant manager at the Asli Village Food Court at NTUC Downtown East in Pasir Ris, was jailed for nine months yesterday.
He pleaded guilty to one count of abetment to theft as a servant.
Another charge of providing false information to the police was taken into consideration during sentencing.
Between Jan 15 and 16, Tan suggested staging the break-in to Roszamri Ma'arof, who was working as an assistant cook at the food court.
The 27-year-old Malaysian agreed to be part of the plan.
The court heard that Tan received a call from Roszamri shortly before the pair staged the break-in. Tan then told him told to wait at Downtown East.
Not long afterwards, at about 4.30am on Jan 24, Tan counted the daily earnings at the food court and placed the $45,000 in the safe.
He later met Roszamri before hailing a taxi.
While inside the vehicle, Tan waited for Roszamri on the main road beside Downtown East.
In the meantime, the younger man entered the office and stole the safe before joining Tan in the taxi.
The pair made their way to Tan's flat at Rivervale Drive in Sengkang.
Tan, who knew the code, unlocked the safe, took out the money and shared it with Roszamri.
Later that day, at around 12.12pm, Tan called the police to inform them about the break-in and the missing safe.
But he was arrested at his home at about 4am two days later following investigations.
Roszamri was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoints on Jan 31 as he was returning from Malaysia.
Officers seized from him more than $1,000 in cash in different currencies, some gold jewellery and a silver pouch.
Roszamri was given six months' jail in February.
For abetment to theft as a servant, Tan could have been jailed up to seven years and fined.
