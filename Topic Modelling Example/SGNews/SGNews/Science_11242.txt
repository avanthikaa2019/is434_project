KUALA LUMPUR - Eager stargazers' hopes of viewing the partial lunar eclipse at the National Planetarium were crushed when a thick cloud persisted for hours.
The partial eclipse, which had been expected to be visible from 7.18pm to 8.07pm yesterday, was completely obscured.
Telescopes had been set up for visitors to join other Malaysians across the country, including at the Langkawi National Observatory, in observing the phenomenon.
They had also expected to see the planets Saturn and Mars.
However, as the clouds did not clear up, they were treated to a simulation of the event inside the space theatre instead.
Visitor Abu Hanipah Shariff, 44, said he had arrived at 6.30pm so his sons would not miss the eclipse.
He said he wanted his sons to witness the phenomenon first-hand.
His third son Mohd Amjad Zakwan, nine, was disappointed as he had never viewed an eclipse before.
"My favourite planet is Mars and it is red like my favourite football team, Liverpool. I'm also in the red sports team in school," he said.
Another young visitor, Heng Kang Lin, 12, said that despite the disappointment, he was looking forward to another astronomy event tomorrow, where the planet Venus will cross in front of the sun.
This is a rare event called the Venus Transit, which is set to occur next in December 2117.
National Space Agency (Angkasa) deputy director-general Dr Noordin Ahmad has invited the public to come and witness the historic event from 8am to 1pm tomorrow.
