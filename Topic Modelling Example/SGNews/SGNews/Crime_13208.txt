A man has been arrested at Serangoon Ave 2 on Wednesday for suspected involvement in loansharking activities.
The 23-year-old man is a debtor-turned-runner who had assisted loansharks in their business by performing electronic fund transactions using his own bank account.
An ATM card was found in his possession when he was arrested at about 4.25pm that day.
Investigations are ongoing.
Carrying on the business of moneylending by an unlicensed moneylender carries a penalty of a fine between $30,000 and $300,000, imprisonment of up to four years and up to six strokes of the cane.
