PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry (MDTCC) enforcement officers seized more than RM5 million (S$2.0) worth of imitation football jerseys in raids on two locations here yesterday.
In what was described as the biggest seizure in Selangor this year, 250,000 fake jerseys carrying premium brands were confiscated from the two premises in Sri Damansara 5 and Sri Damansara 13.
Both premises, which doubled up as storerooms for the goods, were believed to be run by a syndicate.
The officers also detained a woman, in her 20s, at the Sri Damansara 13 premise who was guarding the storeroom when the operation was mounted.
The raids, led by the ministry's director of enforcement, Othman Nawang, were conducted simultaneously at about 8am yesterday after two weeks of surveillance at both locations.
It was learnt that the jerseys were meant for sale at shops in the Klang Valley.
"We believe that they are going to sell each jersey for between RM15 and RM30," Othman said.
He added that the syndicate was believed to have been been active for the last six months.
