JAKARTA - Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Pandji Suko Hari Judho confirmed that an armed-man caught on camera hitting motorcyclist near a bus stop on Jl. Tentara Pelajar, Central Jakarta was indeed a soldier. He said the soldier had been detained by the Jakarta Military Police for questioning.
"We heavily regret the emotional stance that the soldier had taken during the incident. Right now, he is being questioned by the Jakarta Military Police," Panji told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday.
He said that the incident was started by a motorcyclist who was annoyed by a Toyota Avanza with military license plate that bumped into his motorbike.
"The motorcyclist then angrily asked the car to stop and asked the driver, who turned out to be a soldier, to step outside," he said.
Even further, he said that the motorcyclist provoked the soldier by saying that the latter had been arrogant while driving. Provoked by the motorcyclist, Panji added, the soldier then grabbed his gun and hit the motorcyclist several times before he was apprehended by military police personnel who happened to pass by that area.
"We have examined the gun and it turned out to be an air soft gun," he said, downplaying the seriousness of the allegations.
Panji added that the soldier, who works at the army headquarters, was on his way to pick up his sick mother at the airport.
