MALACCA - A Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) officer was arrested early on Monday for allegedly assaulting a policeman after his car was stopped in Bukit Beruang, here. Sources said the MACC officer, attached to the commission's state headquarters, was stopped by police at 2am when he was found to be driving recklessly.
"The police in a patrol car then approached the suspect, but the MACC officer did not cooperate and soon a heated argument broke out between the MACC officer and one of the policemen.
"The suspect hurled abusive words at the policeman.
"The man then punched the policeman, prompting his colleagues to come to his aid," a source said.
He said the man was then arrested and brought to the Ayer Keroh police station.
State police chief Datuk Chuah Ghee Lye confirmed the arrest, but declined to elaborate.
