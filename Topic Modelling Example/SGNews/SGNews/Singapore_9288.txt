The new Gardens by the Bay will transform Singapore's living environment, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the opening ceremony of the Bay South Garden yesterday.
"We have strived to build a world-class living environment through greenery," he said, adding that Singapore is "connecting communities and places through parks, gardens, streetscapes and sky-rise greenery".
PM Lee, who was the guest of honour at the official opening ceremony, toured the OCBC Skyway, the Heritage Gardens and the Cloud Forest cooled conservatory before delivering his speech at the Flower Dome event space.
He said that the garden will enhance the value of the land in Marina Bay as a new city centre which "all Singaporeans can be proud of, identify with, and think of".
Likening the garden to Central Park in New York, he added: "Gardens by the Bay will be an icon of the redeveloped Marina Bay, and a jewel on the skyline of the city."
The sprawling 54ha Bay South Garden is the largest and first of three gardens that will be part of Gardens by the Bay. It was finally opened after five years of construction.
At the end of his speech, PM Lee - together with Gardens' chairman, Mrs Theresa Foo, chief executive officer Kiat W.
Tan and Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan - unveiled the plaque for the official opening of Gardens by the Bay.
Bay South Garden will be open to the public from today, from 5am to 2am. Admission is free except for the cooled conservatories, which are open only from 9am to 9pm with ticket prices ranging from $15 for children to $20 for adults.
