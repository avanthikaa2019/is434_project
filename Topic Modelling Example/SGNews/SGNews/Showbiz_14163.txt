Mainland Chinese actress Hu Jing has revealed that she had a quarrel with her Malaysian husband, business tycoon Frank Choo.
Guang Ming Daily reported that Hu broke down at a press conference and made the confession.
The actress gave birth to a baby boy in 2009. The daily reported that her family was not happy because the actress had not been around much for her son due to work commitments.
The couple met at a dinner in 2004 and fell in love with each other before they tied the knot in 2008.
