Next year, the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) will see a new building for medical education and research on its premises.
Coined The Academia, the twin-tower facility - consisting of the Diagnostic and Discovery towers - will span 75,000 sq m and cost $360 million.
Public health group Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) held a topping-out ceremony for the facility at the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School yesterday, with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong as guest of honour.
When completed, the SGH's pathology department will move into the Diagnostic Tower, while SingHealth's research and education facilities will occupy the Discovery Tower.
Located close to the Duke- NUS school and national speciality centres like the National Cancer Centre, the new facility will help promote collaboration between medical students and industry experts.
For instance, SingHealth and Duke-NUS will be advancing their Academic Clinic Programs (ACP) that started last October, which brings together specialists across various institutions to share resources and develop ideas to improve medical education and research.
"We must accelerate collaborations like these, so we can truly realise our vision for academic medicine in the service of our patients," said Professor Ivy Ng, group chief executive of SingHealth.
