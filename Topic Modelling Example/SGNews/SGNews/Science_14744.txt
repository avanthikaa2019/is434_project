Social escorts are being recruited via the Internet, reported China Press.
Syndicates have set up websites and are recruiting women by asking them to fill up personal details on their online employment forms. Later, their half-nude pictures are also sought, the report added.
Applicants can choose to either work part-time or full-time, the report said, adding that the recruits were categorised as students, foreigners, housewives and office workers.
Depending on their eligibility and category, the women could charge their clients between RM100 and RM4,000 (S$40 and S$1,600) per hour, added the paper, saying the syndicates registered their websites outside Malaysia.
Their sites provide lists of hotels of various star ratings in the Klang Valley, stipulating that clients must foot the bills for all expenses as well as the taxi fares of the social escort.
Federal CID Secret Societies, Gambling and Vice (D7) chief assistant director Datuk Abdul Jalil Hassan said the police would investigate the matter with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).
