An 84-year-old artist in China is possibly the oldest man in the country wanting to change his gender, Sin Chew Daily reported.
Qian Jinfan is said to be born to a reputable family that has 14 generations of scholars in the Ming and Qing dynasties.
The literary theorist, collector and calligrapher was reported to be taking hormone pills for four years and has adopted a new name, Yiling.
His wife, whom he married when he was 54, does not know of his intention to change his gender.
It was only in December 2008 that Qian felt he was prepared for a sex-change and started to take hormone pills and donned female clothing.
Two years ago, he wrote to the Foshan Cultural, Radio, TV, Film, Press and Publication Bureau to express his intention, which did not meet with objection.
According to provisions, he has to live as a woman for two years before he can change his gender.
