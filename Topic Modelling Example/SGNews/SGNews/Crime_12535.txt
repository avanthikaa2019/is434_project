A general practitioner prescribed Subutex to patients without a proper management and record-keeping plan.
Dr Chai Chwan, 47, also levied a fee on those who returned for more Subutex earlier than planned, and provided incentives to patients to refer new business to him.
Yesterday, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) said he had been fined $8,000 after a disciplinary committee inquiry. He had faced 49 charges related to Subutex and 22 charges linked to the financial incentive programmes he implemented at his clinics in Tampines and Jalan Bukit Merah.
The SMC began investigations after complaints were filed by the Health Ministry in August 2007 and April 2008. The GP was then the licensee and owner of Little Cross Family Clinic at Block 915, Tampines Street 91, and My Little Family Clinic at Block 1, Jalan Bukit Merah.
Dr Chai was alleged to have failed to formulate or adhere to any management plan for patients he had prescribed Subutex to. Subutex was approved by the Health Ministry in 2000 to treat drug abusers. The lack of a proper management plan, however, can result in addiction.
The second group of charges involved his introduction and implementation of two financial schemes. One scheme provided discounts to existing patients who referred new patients. The other saw him imposing a fee on patients who returned to the clinic for Subutex earlier than scheduled.
Dr Chai was found guilty on 31 charges.
He was fined $5,000 for the Subutex charges and $3,000 for the financial schemes, and bore the costs of the proceedings.
