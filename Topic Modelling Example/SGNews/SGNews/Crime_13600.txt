KUALA LUMPUR - A 22-year-old university student was arrested after he presented himself to police for allegedly posting a comment on his Facebook page saying that all policemen should be killed.
The student came to the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters at 10.30am yesterday accompanied by a group that included his parents.
He was arrested shortly upon his arrival and held there before he was handed over to the Cheras district police headquarters.
Cheras OCPD Asst Comm Mohan Singh confirmed the arrest, adding that the student was brought there because the case investigating officer (IO) was from his police district.
"For the time being, he has been arrested. If the IO feels he needs more time to investigate, we may apply for a remand order, or the student will be released on police bail," he added.
Since Thursday, city police have released the photographs of 91 people to assist in investigations into the chaos during the Bersih 3.0 rally on April 28.
City police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Mohmad Salleh said since the photos were released, three people have been identified and detained, including a youth who allegedly struck a traffic policeman.
"We have also identified a few more people and are in the midst of tracking them down," he said in a statement yesterday.
It is learnt that more photos are expected to be released soon.
Police are also seeking information from people who witnessed police using excessive force against demonstrators near Jalan Tun Perak during the rally to assist their investigations.
