When singer-songwriter Charlie Lim first started knocking on the doors of bars and other music venues in Melbourne, Australia, he was just 15.
"I think people were definitely a bit suspicious. They were probably thinking, 'Who's this 15- or 16-year-old Chinese kid who wants to play music,'" he told The New Paper last week over the phone from his home in Melbourne.
Now, Lim, 23, is a regular in the Melbourne music scene, and has been to Singapore several times for events like the Mosaic Music Festival - packing with him his brand of neo-soul and R&amp;B - as well as Music Matters Live.
The Singapore-born Lim, who is now an Australian permanent resident, moved to Melbourne with his family when he was 14.
While there, he topped the state of Victoria in the subject of music performance in the VCE, the Australian equivalent of the Alevels.
It was coming back to Singapore when he was 18 to do national service, though, that taught him the tougher side of being a musician.
"When you're 14 or 15, you think being a musician is so amazing and glamorous," he said.
"It was only later, when I was in the music and drama company in NS, when I had to be a roadie and do all the behind-the-scenes stuff that I realised how much work goes into it."
Last year, he released a four-track EP on his Bandcamp Webpage.
Fans who are keen on new material may have to wait a little bit as Lim said he's a "slow songwriter".
"I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I do have more songs that I'm ready to record," he said.
He will be going on another Asian tour in August and September.
When he returns home after that, he'll begin plotting a short move to New York next year to try to make connections in the music scene there.
It all seems very daunting, but it's the same kind of persistence with which he first knocked on doors in Melbourne that should carry him through.
Said Lim: "I'm very afraid of failure, so I don't think I'd be doing this unless I knew I had some chance at succeeding at it."
