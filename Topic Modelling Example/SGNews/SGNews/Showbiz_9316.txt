Grammy-award winning artist Jason Mraz will stay green while in Singapore for his concert for the opening of Gardens by the Bay on June 29.
Mraz, being a green advocate, will be staying in eco-customised rooms at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) with his entourage.
To suit their "go-green" lifestyles, MBS will be providing current sustainability products and practices such as paperless check-in and check-out, reusable cloth tote bags, chemical free cleaning equipment and others.
Mraz also follows a raw vegan diet which focuses on all natural foods and his lifestyle centres around recycling and reusing. In addition, he keeps a close tab on his and his crew's carbon footprint as well.
Like MBS, Mraz has won several awards on sustainability.
Kevin Teng, Director of Sustainability at MBS said, "Our rooms are already greener than most to begin with - starting with sustainable products in the drywall, paint and even the carpeting."
To show its commitment to the green initiative, MBS invested in a 2 tonne organic waste decomposing compost machine which can convert food waste into clear water.
MBS is the largest hotel in Singapore to adopt such a system as part of the Sands Eco360 programme which is a global sustainability strategy spearheaded by the corporate headquarters Las Vegas Sands Corporation.
