SINGAPORE - Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel can now look forward to more opportunities to continue their education, after an agreement set between SAF and Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP).
Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant-General (LG) Neo Kian Hong and Principal &amp; CEO of NYP, Mr Chan Lee Mun signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on partnership in education at NYP this afternoon.
The 10-year MOU builds upon a standing partnership between NYP and SAF since 1995, and comprises two main areas of collaboration.
The first is the development of bridging certificate programmes which enables SAF personnel with &lsquo;O' Levels or National Institute of Technical Education Certificate (NITEC) to attain a formal diploma qualification through customised NYP diploma programmes.
The second area of collaboration allows servicemen to accumulate credits from SAF courses, which are recognised for academic courses at NYP. This will provide more academic upgrading opportunities to meet the servicemen's aspiration to continue their education.
One of those who has benefited from the collaboration is SAF Sergeant-Major, Senior Warrant Officer Joseph Koa. He said: &ldquo;I am thankful that the SAF has given me the opportunity to further my education. I joined the SAF with an &lsquo;O'-Levels certificate back in 1976 and now possess a Diploma which I obtained in 1999 from NYP thanks to the education partnership between the SAF and NYP.&rdquo;
Since 1995, NYP has conducted 41 different professional military and continuing education courses over a total of 250 times for close to 7,800 SAF servicemen.
