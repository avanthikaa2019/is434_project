A Romanian court on Saturday heard five witnesses from Singapore, including two policemen, at the trial of a former Romanian diplomat accused of manslaughter in a deadly 2009 car crash in Singapore.
Testifying via video link, the two police officers spoke of the state of the car when it was inspected and how it was photographed.
Three pedestrians were hit in two incidents by the car belonging to the Romanian mission here in December 2009. One of them, a 30-year-old Malaysian, suffered brain damage and died.
Former charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu has been charged with manslaughter, causing physical injuries and making false statements. He fled Singapore and has repeatedly denied the charges, saying he was not driving the car which he claimed had been stolen.
The court asked that a rogatory commission be set up to check the car's last 10 journeys before the crash, AFP reported.
Experts will also have to determine if the GPS device in it had been tampered with before the car was found by the police about four hours after the incident.
A new hearing will be held on June 6, when two Romanian witnesses are to testify.
"We expect justice to be done in this case," Singapore's special envoy to Romania Ong Eng Chuan told AFP.
