The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has refined its Organisational Excellence (OE) framework, to help improve the professionalism of the national sports associations (NSAs).
The biggest refinement is putting a stronger emphasis on leadership development and succession planning. NSAs should build systems and processes to ensure that, said SSC chief executive Lim Teck Yin.
On the other hand, an unpopular rule that had previously prevented NSA officials from serving for more than eight straight years has been relaxed.
NSAs can now decide for themselves how long their presidents and management- committee members can serve.
However, they will need to spell out the rationale of their tenure extension to the SSC before they proceed.
Besides leadership development, the NSAs are also encouraged to promote diversity within their management committee, by bringing on board members with different skill sets in areas such as accounting, law and marketing.
NSAs welcome the refinements, with Bob Tan, president of the Singapore Golf Association, saying: "(It) provides a more flexible set of guidelines for NSAs to raise their standard of organisational excellence."
