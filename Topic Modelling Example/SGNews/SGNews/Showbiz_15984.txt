African culture goes on a lively display from April 12 to 15 at the Esplanade with Cirque Mother Africa.
The two-hour show promises to be a state-of-the-art circus show with a party-like atmosphere featuring a myriad of African performers.
Each of the 40 African artists in Cirque Mother Africa is a dancer as well as a singer or a musician, or even all three.
The upcoming tour is a reunion of the best and most spectacular acts of the past four years of the show.
Highlights include Mwangi Lazaraus Gitu from Kenya, the most flexible man in the world; the Brothers Ramadhani with their powerful and aesthetic hand-to-hand act; and Yonas &amp; Tariku from Ethiopia.
Yonas &amp; Tariku's act is a crowd favourite where Yonas is twirled in the air by Tariku, who uses only his feet to perform the feat.
The troupe also features a multi-instrumentalist playing a variety of African instruments to present the wide range of African music.
