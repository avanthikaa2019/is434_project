SINGAPORE - Peter Khoo Chong Meng, former senior vice-president of the English and Malay News Division, at Singapore Press Holdings' (SPH), was charged in court today for criminal breach of trust and corruption.
The 49-year-old, who is now a marketing and branding consultant, faces two charges of criminal breach of trust and another eight charges of corruption tendered by the Corruption Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).
In September 2010, it was reported that he had voluntarily admitted to receiving illegal payments and misappropriating shopping vouchers handled by his Editorial Projects Unit.
These vouchers were intended for branding and promotion activities of The Straits Times, which his unit organises.
Mr Khoo has made restitution of $196,500 for the payments he admitted to receiving illegally and for the vouchers he misappropriated.
He was then dismissed by SPH, where he worked for 22 years.
The Straits Times reported that he arrived in court with his lawyers at 8.45am today.
He declined to speak to the media.
Khoo will return to court on July 10.
