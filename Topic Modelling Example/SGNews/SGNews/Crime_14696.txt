HONG KONG - A Colombian man was arrested in Hong Kong for allegedly trying to smuggle 4.6 kilos (10 pounds) of cocaine into the southern Chinese city, officials said Friday.
The 46-year-old man arrived on a flight from Bogota on Thursday with the drugs, worth about HK$5.2 million (S$838,000), hidden in his baggage, customs officials said.
"The customs officers inspected his bag and found the drugs in a secret compartment with the cocaine soaked in cotton," a customs spokesman said.
The man will be charged with drug trafficking on Saturday, he added.
