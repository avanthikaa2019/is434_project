Facebook released a "camera" app last Thursday, that lets people take Instagram-style pictures that can be shared with iPhones.
The standalone mobile app synchs with the online social network, letting users consult friends' photos. The app "makes using Facebook photos faster and easier", said product manager Dirk Stoop.
