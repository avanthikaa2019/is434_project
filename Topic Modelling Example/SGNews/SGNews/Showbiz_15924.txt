Datuk Siti Nurhaliza Tarudin is standing by her man despite furious gossip that her husband is purportedly getting married to a beautiful actress, reported Sinar Harian.
The singer rubbished talk that her husband Datuk Seri Khalid Muhammad Jiwa, better known as Datuk K, will marry Rozita Che Wan.
"I got to know about the rumours from the Internet. Honestly, I did not know how to react after reading it because this is not the first time such a rumour has surfaced.
"I don't feel anything at all and I don't think I need to question my husband about it because it's not true," she said at a Mother's Day reception in Subang Jaya on Tuesday.
The singer revealed that the gossip had affected her husband.
She said Datuk K felt uncomfortable when asked about the rumour by his friends and had to assure them that it was untrue.
"It's also not true that Rozita and I have ill feelings towards each other," she added.
