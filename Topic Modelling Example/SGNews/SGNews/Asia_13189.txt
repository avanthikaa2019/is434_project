WELLINGTON - A New Zealand churchgoer became so enraged that the dishes had not been done following a Sunday service that she ripped off part of a fellow parishioner's earlobe, a report said Friday.
The attack occurred during a meeting of church members who have known each other for about 10 years, the Manawatu Standard newspaper said.
Ateliana Lei Malu, 52, became agitated after mentioning the dishes had not been done and then pulled the man to the ground, scratched his face, gave him a black eye and pulled his hair, the report said.
When parishioners pulled Malu off the victim, she lashed out again, ripping off part of his earlobe.
Malu pleaded guilty in court to a charge of assault and will be sentenced next month.
