His role was to get people to wager money via an online football betting account, and to monitor the bets.
For assisting the football bookie, he was paid $2,000 a month.
He met the bookie, whose name is not known, in Malaysia last year. He was issued the account.
In addition, he was also given $550 by the man as standby cash for his illegal activities.
Singaporean Koh Kian Huat, 39, faced five charges of acting as a bookie.
Last Friday, he was jailed three weeks and fined $40,000.
The court heard that Koh accepted bets from as low as $20 to as high as $2,030.
The bets were to forecast the results of various football fixtures, including the English Premier League and World Cup 2014 Asia Qualifiers.
Among his tools of trade were two mobile phones, a calculator and a laptop, which were seized during his arrest at Towner Road last November.
Investigations revealed that he communicated the football bets with punters using his mobile phones and had used his laptop to access his online football account.
He committed the offences at a unit at Block 656B Jurong West Street 61 over five consecutive days in November last year.
Three of the five charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.
Two were proceeded against.
The sentences for both charges are to run concurrently.
It is an offence for anyone to act as a bookmaker.
If convicted, the person can be fined between $20,000 and $200,000 and can also be jailed for up to five years.
