WASHINGTON - A US college student has told police he killed his roommate, cut up the body and ate part of the victim's brain and his whole heart, US media reports said Thursday.
Alexander Kinyua of Baltimore, Maryland, was arrested on Tuesday after police searched his house following the discovery by his brother of the victim's head and hands, the Baltimore Sun reported.
Kinyua, a 21-year-old student at Morgan State University, confessed on Thursday to murdering and dismembering his roommate, Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, and then eating parts of his brain followed by his entire heart, the Sun said.
The motive was unclear, but Kinyua was charged with first-degree murder on Wednesday.
The grisly murder caps an especially gruesome week of crimes in North America.
Interpol has launched a manhunt for a Canadian porn star suspected of dismembering his boyfriend and making a video of the murder, while a young man in Miami was shot dead on Saturday as he gnawed off the face of a homeless man.
