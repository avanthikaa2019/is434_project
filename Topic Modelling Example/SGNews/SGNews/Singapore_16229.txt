SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) advises Singaporeans against travelling to the South Thailand including the provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat and Songkhla.
This is in view of the recent bomb blasts in Yala and in Hat Yai, which led to a fire at the Lee Gardens Plaza Hotel killing three people including a Malaysian tourist.
MFA advised Singaporeans with an urgent need to travel to these provinces to monitor local news and developments, take all necessary precautions for their personal safety and purchase comprehensive travel insurance.
In a statement to the media, MFA said it is closely monitoring the situation in Hat Yai. It added that the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok has established that the 31 Singaporeans in Hat Yai, including the 10 who were at Lee Gardens Plaza hotel, are safe.
An officer from the Embassy is in Hat Yai to provide consular assistance to these Singaporeans and to determine if there are other Singaporeans who may need assistance.
Singaporeans who require consular assistance should contact the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok or the MFA Duty Officer (24-hours) at:
