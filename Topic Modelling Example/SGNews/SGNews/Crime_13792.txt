SINGAPORE - The former proprietor and director of security services supplier Gatekeeper Resources, Lee Chin Khuay, pleaded guilty on Thursday of cheating several banks of over $15 million.
Lee, 60, had applied for invoice financing amounting to more than $15.3 million from DBS, OCBC and Standard Chartered banks under false pretences, said the Straits Times.
Investigations began in September 2010 when the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received information that Gatekeeper may have committed fraud.
According to these investigations, Lee had made 117 fraudulent applications between May 2008 and July 2010, using fake invoices and delivery orders supposedly issued by four firms.
On top of this, Lee also admitted to converting criminal proceeds by buying shares in listed companies.
Lee was jailed a total of 18 months.
The court heard that he had made the fraudulent applications in order to generate money to repay the earlier financing. Money from these new applications were disbursed to the four firms, eventually making its way back to Gatekeeper's account.
The paper reported that according to Deputy Public Prosecutor Christopher Ong, full restitution had been made.
In passing sentence, District Judge See Kee Oon considered the large number of offences, large amount involved, as well as the fact that he misled the four firms in the commission of the offences.
