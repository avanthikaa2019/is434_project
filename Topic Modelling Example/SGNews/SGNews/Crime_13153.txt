A video surveillance operator and four accomplices worked together to cheat the Marina Bay Sands casino of nearly $150,000.
Ho Boon Keat, 29, was jailed for three years on Friday.
While Ho was on duty monitoring security video footage, his accomplices would gamble at the Sic Bo tables.
In Sic Bo, gamblers roll three dice, and can win 180 times their original bet if all three of a certain number appear.
An accomplice would claim to have placed a $25 bet after a triple appeared.
The pit manager at the table would ask Ho to check video footage for confirmation, and Ho would lie and confirm that a bet had been placed.
Ho and his accomplices deceived pit managers 33 times between July 16 and August 14 in 2011.
This is the first case of where a video surveillance operator colluded with patrons to cheat the casino.
Ho's accomplices have yet to appear in court.
