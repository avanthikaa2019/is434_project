Water-based activities at a Ministry of Education's adventure centre has been ceased after a crocodile was spotted in the waters off Lim Chu Kang.
The crocodile was first spotted on March 29, The Sunday Times reported.
Mr Sim Song Huat told the paper that he had seen a 2m-long crocodile nearby where the students usually kayak.

Subsequently the operator notified the ministry of the sighting.
Schools that have booked water activites from now until the end of the year have been told of the suspension, an MOE spokesman told the paper.
There have been other crocodile sightings in waters near Kranji Reservoir and the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.
Mr Wong Tuan Wah, National Parks Board's director of conservation, advised visitors to stay calm and back away slowly if they encounter a crocodile.
