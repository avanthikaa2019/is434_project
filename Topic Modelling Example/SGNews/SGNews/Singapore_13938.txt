In his speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cited a recent Hong Kong TV documentary praising Singapore's successful economic development.
The TVB documentary, Finance Magazine, had said that Hong Kong could learn from Singapore's experience in employing effective economic strategies.
Mr Lee said: "I hope people can view our situation objectively. Every country has its problems, but we also cannot neglect our achieve- ments."
