LONDON - A fresh wave of Beatlemania could sweep the world after Paul McCartney's son said four of the legendary British rock group's children were considering setting up a band together.
James McCartney told the BBC website that he and John Lennon's son Sean, George Harrison's son Dhani, and Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey had mooted the idea of forming "The Beatles - The Next Generation".
"I'd be up for it," said the 34-year-old, who is launching a solo career as a singer and guitarist. "Sean seemed to be into it, Dhani seemed to be into it."
He added that Starkey was less keen, but that the band could "hopefully" happen with "nature's support".
All four have followed in their fathers' footsteps and pursued musical careers. Sean Lennon is a New York-based singer-songwriter, while Dhani Harrison fronts London rock band thenewno2.
Zak Starkey became a drummer like his father Ringo Starr and has played with bands including The Who and Oasis.
James McCartney, who strongly resembles his father, said he had "dreamt of being better than The Beatles".
"I'm not sure if I can do that," he told the BBC. "If anything, I would love to be equal to The Beatles - but even that's quite tough."
The younger McCartney was playing a gig Tuesday in Liverpool, north-west England, at the famous Cavern Club where The Beatles first made their name.
His two EPs have been co-produced by his father, who at 69 shows no signs of retiring and released his latest album "Kisses on the Bottom" this year.
