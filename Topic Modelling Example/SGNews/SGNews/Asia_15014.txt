BRASILIA - China and other world powers will back "further consequences" against North Korea if it undertakes new provocation following its rocket launch, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday.
"We are working to ensure that the new North Korea leadership hears unequivocally from the international community that their provocative behaviour will not be rewarded," Clinton said during a trip to Brasilia.
She hailed action taken Monday by the United Nations in response to the rocket North Korea launched last week -- a rocket launch that the West said was a disguised missile test.
The UN Security Council on Monday ordered tightened sanctions on North Korea over its failed rocket launch and warned of new action if the isolated state stages a nuclear test.
"We have all agreed -- that includes China -- that there will be further consequences if they pursue another provocative action," Clinton said at a press conference with Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota.
