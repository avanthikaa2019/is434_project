WASHINGTON - Former US president Bill Clinton said Thursday he thought that fellow Democrat Barack Obama would be easily re-elected to the White House, even though polls currently show a close race.
"I still think the president will win by five or six points," Clinton told CNN, in an interview with movie producer Harvey Weinstein.
Obama faces presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney in the November 6 election.
Romney has surged ahead of Obama in the southern battleground state of Florida, holding a 47-41 per cent lead, according to a recent Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
However Obama and Romney are even in a number of nationwide polls.
At this point polls show support for the two men closer than it will be in November, Clinton said, due to continued stress on the US economy.
But if Obama's supporters hit the trail and tout his achievements as president, Clinton said he was confident "he'll be fine and he'll be re-elected."
