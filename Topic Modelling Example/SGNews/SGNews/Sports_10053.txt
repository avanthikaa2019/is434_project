Spanish tennis superstar Rafael Nadal is swamped by a jubilant crowd after winning the men's singles final against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic of Serbia at the French Open tennis tournament.
The win last Monday was Nadal's seventh at the tournament, beating Bjorn Borg's record for wins at the clay court major.
