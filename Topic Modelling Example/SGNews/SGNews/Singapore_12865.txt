The Singapore Civil Defence Forces (SCDF) said in a statement to the media that they received a call at 10.53am about a fire at Blk 704, Ang Mo Kio Ave 8.
A fire engine, three fire bikes, a Red Rhino, 2 support vehicles and an ambulance were deployed to the scene.
When the SCDF arrived, they found the unit on fire and used two water jets to put out the fire in 10 minutes.
Contributors to citizen journalism website Stomp sent in photos of the fire.
A contributor who went by the name Paul Long said he heard an explosion before the fire started.
