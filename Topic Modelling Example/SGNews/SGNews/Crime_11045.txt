KAJANG - In one of the largest seizures in the country, about one million copies of pirated DVDs, worth more than RM10 million (S$4 million), were seized in three separate locations at Taman Segar Perdana, Cheras, yesterday.
The haul, the biggest in Selangor to date, came after five 20-man teams from the Home Ministry's film censorship control and enforcement division's Selangor branch raided a shophouse and two double-storey terrace houses at 4pm.
During the raid, the enforcement teams also detained three suspects, aged between 32 and 70.
The enforcement division's state chief Noor Aziah Abdullah said they believed a major DVD distribution syndicate had been crippled following the raids.
"The three suspects are believed to be working for the same owner. One of them is a government pensioner and thought the business was legitimate.
"Their modus operandi was turning houses into storage, distribution and repackaging centres to prevent the authorities from tracking down their operations," she said, adding that the ministry acted on tip-offs and after two weeks' of surveillance.
Checks by the raiding parties revealed that the houses had also been renovated to make room for more storage space for the discs.
One of the houses had been rented out for the past five years.
"The suspects will be charged under the Film Censorship Act 2002.
"The owner hasn't been identified yet but we are tracking him down."
