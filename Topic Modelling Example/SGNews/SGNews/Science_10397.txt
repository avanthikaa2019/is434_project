Consumers looking for a convenient guide on high-end shopping can now turn to Luxury Locator: Singapore, touted as the first location-based luxury shopping application here.
Launched by WhiteWave Media Group - an associate firm of SPH Magazines - the app allows users to locate a variety of luxury boutiques in Singapore.
Shoppers are able to browse a database of luxury boutiques and retailers using three categories - brand, product category or location - said WhiteWave in a press release.
The intuitive app allows a higher level of location-based accuracy in displaying stores and products near a shopper.
A proprietary geolocation algorithm is responsible for this level of accuracy.
The app is free for download on Apple's iTunes App Store. It comes in English and simplified Chinese.
WhiteWave Media Group is an integrated luxury media group, with offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
