Students can now design science experiments and conduct research at the Centre for Research and Applied Learning in Science (Cradle).
The new open learning and research lab at the Science Centre Singapore (SCS) will give students between the ages of 14 and 18 years more avenues to learn about science through inquiry-based experiments and research.
The centre, which opened yesterday, will also help develop teacher-mentors and enhance the capacity of teachers and schools in science research and innovation, reported Channel NewsAsia.
Cradle is a collaboration between SCS, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), DSO National Laboratories and the Ministry of Education.
