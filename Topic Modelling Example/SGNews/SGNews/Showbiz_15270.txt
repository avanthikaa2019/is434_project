At 64, this American musician - famous for tunes such as Bat Out Of Hell - is sounding as over-the-top as ever on his 12th studio album.
Hard-rock numbers like Party Of One and Stand In The Storm (featuring everyone from Mark McGrath to Lil Jon) may be a little cheesy, but he sounds so convincing, you can't help but rock out along with him.
There's also a kitschy, dark cover of California Dreamin', you know, for good measure.
