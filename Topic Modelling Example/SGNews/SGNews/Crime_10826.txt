Four Public Order Agency officers and a journalist have been arrested in connection with the rape of two teenagers in Indonesia.
The victims, aged 14 and 19, were sisters.
Palu police chief Adj. Sr. Comr Ahmad Ramadhan told tempo.co the officers were aged between 29 and 39, while the journalist, who works for Potret Sulawesi, is 33.
Ahmad said the suspects approached the two siblings and interrogated them at Talise beach in Palu of Central Sulawesi.
The suspects took the teenagers in a patrol car to the Palu mayoral office's public order agency post for further interrogation.
But on their way, they stopped in a quiet place, where they allegedly took turns to rape the sisters.
The victims filed a report with the police later in the morning.
"We have been raped by five men. Four of them were public order officers and the other one a journalist," said the victims at Palu Police headquarters.
Ahmad said from medical tests undergone by the victims, it was clear they had been raped.
