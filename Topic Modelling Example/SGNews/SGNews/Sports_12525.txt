LOS ANGELES - The top-seeded San Antonio Spurs pushed the Los Angeles Clippers to the brink of elimination from the NBA playoffs with an astonishing 96-86 comeback win in Game Three on Saturday.
Trailing by 24 points early in the second quarter, the Spurs seized control through All-Stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan to take a commanding 3-0 lead in their best-of-seven Western Conference semi-final series.
Guard Parker recorded 23 points and 10 assists while towering forward Duncan weighed in with 19 points and 13 rebounds as San Antonio extended their unbeaten run to 17 games, including seven in the playoffs.
Forward Blake Griffin led the way for the fifth-seeded Clippers with 28 points and 16 rebounds but his heart-broken team paid the penalty for poor free shooting, making only 50 per cent from the stripe.
The fast-paced Clippers made a rousing start at a sellout Staples Center, racing into a 27-9 lead after a sizzling 14-0 run sparked by Griffin before ending the first quarter 33-11 ahead.
Los Angeles briefly stretched their lead to 24 points when Nick Young poured in a three-pointer but, with Parker and Duncan beginning to make an impact, the Spurs cut the deficit to 53-43 by halftime.
San Antonio tightened their defense and, as the Clippers struggled to find the basket, the visitors took the lead for the first time at 59-57 after a Duncan fadeaway jump shot capped a stirring 14-0 run.
The Spurs extended that unbroken run to 24-0 before ending the third quarter with a 69-61 advantage.
San Antonio maintained their grip in the fourth quarter, repeatedly fouling Clippers reserve forward Reggie Evans who made just three of 10 free throws as time ebbed away.
Game Four is in Los Angeles on Sunday when the Spurs will look to complete a 4-0 sweep.
The Los Angeles Lakers, trailing 1-2 in their Western Conference semi-final series against Oklahoma City, were set to host the Thunder in Game Four at the Staples Center later on Saturday.
