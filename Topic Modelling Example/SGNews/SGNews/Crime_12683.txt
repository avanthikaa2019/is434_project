A 46-year-old man was arrested after police said he stabbed another man in the chest at a New York City library because the man was watching porn on a computer.
Police sources said Ralph Neptune, who is homeless, was with his wife at the Brooklyn Heights branch of the Brooklyn Public Library when he saw porn on the 52-year-old victim's screen about 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, the New York Daily News reported.
"He was with his wife and he accused the other guy of looking at porn," a police source said. "The guy looking at porn picked up a chair and hits him. The guy who was offended said, 'I have a knife,' and stabs him in the chest."
The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injures, police said.
Neptune was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon, menacing and criminal possession of marijuana.
