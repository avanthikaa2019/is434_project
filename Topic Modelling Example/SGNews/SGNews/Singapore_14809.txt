In support of Earth Day, NTUC FairPrice (FairPrice) will encourage customers to save and reduce the use of plastic bags during their grocery shopping.
The FairPrice Cares! Campaign will run from April 22 to 28 and is appealing to customers to bring their own bags.
The campaign aims to help FairPrice save at least 100,000 plastic bags in one week.
This is the third year FairPrice is organising the FairPrice Cares! Campaign.
To encourage community participation, FairPrice has also committed to donate $30,000 at the end of the campaign to Bizlink Centre and Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled to assist them in their community work.
FairPrice staff have been regularly volunteering at the Bishan Home.
FairPrice was the first supermarket to develop and launch a Green Rewards Scheme in 2007. The scheme looks to help minimise plastic bag wastage and enables customers to enjoy a 10-cent rebate for bringing their own reusable shopping bag with a minimum spending of $10.
This scheme successfully saves about five to six million plastic bags a year.
