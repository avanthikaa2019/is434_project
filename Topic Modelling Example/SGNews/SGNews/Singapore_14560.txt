A record 97 per cent of taxpayers - about 925,000 people - e-filed their tax returns this year by the April 18 deadline, said the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) yesterday.
The overall filing rate was 94 per cent, including 31,000 taxpayers who filed paper returns and 740,000 who were on the No-Filing Service.
This year, 1.2 million taxpayers enjoyed simplified filing because their employers are under the Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS), where their employment and income information were pre-filled in their tax returns. Iras will extend the AIS next year to include employers with 15 or more employees.
