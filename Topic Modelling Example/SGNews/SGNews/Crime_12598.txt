How did Chong Chee Hiong manage to get staff at the CPF Service Centre at Bishan to reset Dr Elgin Tan's password?
Last Friday, The New Paper asked the CPF Board what checks CPF customer service officers perform for such requests.
We also asked if any of Dr Tan's CPF money had been affected.
But the CPF Board did not answer by press time.
TNP visited the service centre at Bishan last Friday afternoon and, in an hour, saw about 15 people making SingPass-related applications (getting or resetting passwords) at a counter.
The customer service officer would glance down at the applicant's NRIC, and up at his or her face several times.
No other documents were required to get or reset the SingPass password.
Last year, 3,578 cheating and related offences were recorded by the police, up from 3,501 in 2010 and 3,135 in 2009.
Lawyer Sunil Sudheesan said that if someone had another person's NRIC, he could use it to borrow from loan sharks, after which the victim could get harassed.
Another instance of the misuse of another's person's NR IC would be to use the NRIC to buy a mobile phone, causing bills to be charged to the victim.
Lawyer Foo Cheow Ming said: "The miscreant can impersonate you, open e-mail or Facebook accounts using your name and picture, and use the e-mail or Facebook account to commit libel.
"In Singapore, if someone uses your name to libel a public figure, you may be sued for millions of dollars in damages."
