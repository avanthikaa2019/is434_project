KOSMO! reported that popular actress and model Rafidah Ibrahim has denied rumours she has become the second wife of a renowned entrepreneur.
The 26-year-old star, better known as Fida, is said to have married the man in his 40s in Perlis on April 7.
Fida had apparently said the rumours could have started because she was friendly with many businessmen in recent times given that she would be opening a beauty parlour next month.
"I'm not married yet. All this false talk came through a gossip column. I was busy acting in the drama Tetap Maghrib when all this happened," she told the tabloid.
However, Fida said she would be ready to be someone's second wife.
"If that is what God has decided, I'm willing to accept my fate. I want to get married to someone who is good to me," she added.
