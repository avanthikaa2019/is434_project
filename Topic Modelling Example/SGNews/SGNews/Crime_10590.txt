PETALING JAYA - The family of suspected car thief A. Kugan, who died in police custody in January 2009, wants the investigation into his death re-opened.
Kugan's family lawyer N. Surendran said this was because only one police officer had been charged and found guilty in relation to his death although 11 others were suspended during the initial investigations.
The family, added Surendran, also wanted an independent investigation into the 22-year-old's death and for a Royal Commission of Inquiry to be set up.
He said the family was also dissatisfied that in the case, Kons V. Navindran, 31, was only found guilty of causing hurt to Kugan and sentenced to three years in jail.
Present at a press conference held at the PKR headquarters here yesterday were Kugan's mother N. Indra, 43, and aunt S. Renuga, 34.
Sessions Court judge Aslam Zainuddin, who sentenced Kons Navindran on Monday, had allowed a stay of execution pending appeal.
Meanwhile, Indra was too overcome with emotion and asked Renuga to speak for her.
Renuga said family members, especially Kugan's grandmother P. Muthamma, 64, was devastated over the court's decision.
"He was her eldest grandchild and she raised him. She cannot accept the fact that Kugan has died in vain," she said.
