Looking to untether yourself from your Apple music player? With the Nakamichi NW501, you can free yourself from pesky wires and be fashionable at the same time.
This pair of foldable wireless headphones uses 2.4GHz digital technology to deliver audio via a dongle connected to your iPhone, iPod or iPad.
It also has an auto shut-off function to prolong battery life and comes with a pouch for easy storage.
If you don't own an Apple product but still fancy the black/red or white/red colour schemes, don't fret - the set has a wired adapter that can interface with your device in a more traditional way.
