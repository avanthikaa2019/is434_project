LOS ANGELES - Leonard Cohen's ex-manager was jailed for 18 months on Tuesday for harassing the veteran singer, after a week-long trial in which hundreds of expletive-laced messages were read out in court.
Though Kelley Lynch will likely spend much less time behind bars because of prison overcrowding in California, she was also sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to attend anger-management sessions.
Lynch, who had a 17-year professional relationship with the singer and was briefly his lover, was convicted last week on five counts of breaching restraining orders and harassing the the singer.
Cohen fired her in 2004, accusing her stealing some US$5 million (S$6.3 million) from him while he lived in a monastery near Los Angeles.
He sued her in 2005, and a judge ordered her to pay him US$9.5 million. But the veteran singer - whose hits include "Suzanne" and "Hallelujah" - came out of retirement in part to rebuild his finances.
Cohen has since continued to tour with great success, resurrecting his career and reputation worldwide.
