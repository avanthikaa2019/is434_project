BUTTERWORTH, Malaysia - An engineer here was sentenced to a year's jail and fined a maximum of RM50,000 for insulting the Perak sultan online three years ago.
Chan Hon Keong, 29, was found guilty by the Sessions Court of knowingly creating and sending the offensive remark against the sultan on Feb 13, 2009, at midnight in his house in Taman Arowana Emas, Permatang Pauh.
Judge Ikmal Hishan Mohd Tajuddin said Chan had committed a very serious offence under the Communications and Multimedia Act (1998).
Chan, who was earlier calm in the dock, appeared stunned when he heard the judgment and his wife who was in the public gallery with Chan's father was seen crying.
Chan's lawyer Md Yusof Idris applied for a stay pending an appeal.
Deputy public prosecutor Lailawati Ali did not object to the stay but asked the court to increase Chan's bail.
Ikmal Hishan increased the bail from RM6,000 (S$2,456) to RM10,000.
