LOS ANGELES - Demi Moore is finally ready to move on from her failed marriage to Ashton Kutcher. At least in the Twitterverse.
The "G.I. Jane" actress ended months of speculation Thursday, finally answering the question: "When is she going to change her Twitter handle?"
Moore had been going by @MrsKutcher, a handle that grew more awkward with each passing day since November, when she announced plans to divorce "Two and a Half Men" star Kutcher.
Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's "playful."
"So hard finding a name that was fun somewhat playful and available," Moore wrote. "So for now it will be @justdemi It could grow on me!"
In December, Moore dismissed notions that she needed to change her Twitter name ASAP in order to distance herself from her ex.
"Changing my twitter name isn't a top priority right now," she tweeted. "Sorry it bothers so many of u. Should I not tweet until I do? Does it really matter?"
