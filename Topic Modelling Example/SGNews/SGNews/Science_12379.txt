That was what The New Paper on Sunday observed when we visited a mall's foodcourt on a weekend. They were playing with their game consoles or iPhones and some seemed oblivious of the food placed in front of them.
Mothers we spoke to seemed nonchalant about the phenomenon, noting that it is something that takes place all the time.
But parents may sit up with more concern now that it has been revealed that the time spent with such gadgets can contribute to myopia.

He is also concerned about how the gadgets could affect the child's ability to communicate face to face with other people.
