The iconic Guggenheim Museum in New York is going to stage a wide-ranging exhibition of Asian art, and has appointed a Singaporean curator to scout the region to acquire artworks in a new initiative involving tens of millions of dollars in funding.
Ms June Yap, 38, will do a two-year residency in New York, where she will help to curate the exhibition, featuring South and South-east Asian art.
She has worked in the curatorial departments of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum, and has been an independent curator since 2008, working extensively with artists throughout the region.
