SINGAPORE - With the increase in malicious cyber attacks and the nation's deep reliance on Internet services, Singapore needs to boost its cyber security.
Cyber attacks are becoming a real danger, with the potential to equal to or surpass terrorism in the future. Although Singapore has not been attacked, it cannot be assumed that Singapore is not vulnerable to such attacks, said Minister of State for Defence and Education Lawrence Wong at the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp today.
Mr Wong shared that threats are manifested in many forms, such as targeted phishing and advanced persistent threats with the intent to steal users' private data such as usernames, passwords and email contacts. Computers can be hijacked without their users being aware to attack other users or systems through means such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that could cause severe disruptions to services.
He also shared large-scale cyber attacks that affected countries such as Estonia, which had banks and ministries affected for hours in 2007. While there hasn't been terrorists launching full-scale cyber attacks, he added we need to be prepared as terrorists are now also starting to use the internet to conduct operations.
Mr Wong shared several measures Singapore has taken to defend against cyber threats.
The Singapore Infocomm Technology Security Authority (SITSA) was established to work with various industry regulators to assess cyber security vulnerabilities. Last year, the National Cyber Security Centre was set up to boost our national capability to counter security threats.
The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) is working with Singapore University of Technology and Design to set up a research centre iTRUST to study trustworthy computing. The camp that Mr Wong was speaking at is also nother MINDEF initiative to generate greater interest and awareness in cyber defence.
