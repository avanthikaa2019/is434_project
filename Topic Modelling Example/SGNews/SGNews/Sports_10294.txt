PETALING JAYA: Wives and girlfriends often lament about "losing" their other halves when football season comes around but some couples are embracing UEFA Euro 2012 madness together.
Accounts executive Loong Sheng Mae, 25, confessed she only became a huge football fan after she got together with her boyfriend Wang Ie Tjer.
She said they had begun dating during the 2010 FIFA World Cup season and that was when she started getting interested in the game.
"I realised the game was really exciting and now we watch at least one Euro match every night," she said, adding that she was rooting for Germany, Spain and Italy.
She said their job productivity was not affected as they always sleep late.
Wang, 27, is a huge Liverpool fan and has its slogan tattooed just above his wrist in Latin.
He said he loved the fact that Loong enjoyed watching football matches with him.
"I think it's awesome and a great way to spend time together. I have also bought a Liverpool jersey for her," he said.
Kindergarten teacher Shalini Manoharan, 28, said she loved the excitement of the Euro season.
She said she and her husband would sometimes stay up for the 2.45am matches if their favourite countries were playing.
"We are really hoping Holland pulls through to the quarter-finals," she said, adding that they would watch the matches in the comfort of their home.
Her husband, Shankar Jeyaraj, 32, said his friends were jealous that he had a football-mad wife.
"They always say how cool it is that my wife watches football with me instead of complaining that I'm neglecting her," he said with a laugh.
Ardent Netherlands fan Phua Eu Jin, 24, said he would spend weekends watching the UEFA Euro matches with his girlfriend at the mamak restaurant.
"We practise an unspoken rule. She watches one football match with me and I'll take her out for a nice dinner," said the marketing officer.
