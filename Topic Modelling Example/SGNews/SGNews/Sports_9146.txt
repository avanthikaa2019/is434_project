HE insists he is not biased.
Cristiano Ronaldo, according to Peter Schmeichel, has proven himself the best player in the world at Euro 2012.
Ronaldo has "stepped up" when it has mattered for Portugal and brought his team along with him, said Schmeichel, speaking at a press interview arranged by Carlsberg for Asian media in Poland.
"What about Leo Messi?" I challenged the former Manchester United great.
The difference is small but "Messi has limitations", said the Great Dane.
"Cristiano can play in any team and make them better," he said.
Unlike Messi, said Schmeichel, who needs to play alongside players of a high ability to be successful.
"When Messi passes the ball and moves, he needs a player who is intelligent enough to give him back the ball at another place," said the former goalkeeper.
Surely you are biased because Ronaldo used to play for the Red Devils, like you, I asked Schmeichel. "No, I don't think so," came his considered reply.
"I have exact knowledge of what Cristiano can do on the football pitch. I saw him do it for five years at United.
"But he also went on and did the same at Real Madrid and I'm not a fan of Real. I just think that he is a player like none other.
Gifted
"He is big and strong, and he is technically gifted too. Christ, he can defend too. There are no limitations to his play."
Schmeichel added that it was a pity that Ronaldo could not take his team into the final, but does not see it as a failing of the player.
"One team hit the post and the other did not, those are the margins between success and failure," he said.
On the ongoing tournament, the outspoken Dane also hit out at critics of Spain, arguing that they have played flawless "technical football".
"It's no surprise to me that they are in the final," he added.
