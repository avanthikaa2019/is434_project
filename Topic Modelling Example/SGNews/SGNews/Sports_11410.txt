Liverpool legend Craig Bellamy was in Singapore yesterday to officially launch the new Liverpool Football Club home kit designed by Warrior.
Warrior has signed a six-year deal with the Anfield team, and the new home kit has been the fastest selling to date.
Bellamy is the first player to be signed by Warrior and the company has made the Craig Bellamy Foundation, a non-profit organisation that provides education and football coaching to children in Sierra Leone, its official charity.
Warrior and Bellamy kicked their partnership off in style at The Fullerton Hotel, where the Liverpool striker raised an additional S$25,000 for his charity by kicking a number of footballs from a stage on second floor down on to a bumboat anchored on the Singapore River in front of hundreds of reds fans.
