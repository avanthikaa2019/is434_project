BEIJING - China on Friday refuted the accusation from India that Chinese armed forces had overstepped the boundary between the two countries.
"The Chinese side always abides by relevant agreements with India, and is committed to peace and stability along the boundary areas," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei in reference to remarks by Indian Minister of Defence A.K. Antony that Chinese troops had "overstepped the border" more than 500 times in the past two and half years.
Hong also told a regular press briefing that China's stance on the border issue with India is consistent and clear.
