Near the start of this film, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) asks her stepfather Chet (David Koechner) if he thinks his decision to replace lifeguards with strippers "is a very expensive joke". She could be talking about this pointless sequel to Piranha 3D (2010).
The lazy plot details are that Chet is opening a theme park in Arizona called The Big Wet, where attractions include an adult pool. Like so many business types, he ignores the rumours of piranha attacks, having shelled out tons of money to develop the park.
Naturally, the piranhas strike on opening day, just when David Hasselhoff, playing a parody of himself, and Ving Rhames, who was in the previous movie, visit. It is up to Maddy to get rid of the vile fish and save the day, with help from her admirer.
