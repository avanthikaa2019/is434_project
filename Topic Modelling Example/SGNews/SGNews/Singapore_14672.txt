A 26-YEAR-OLD man is upset with a match-making agency in Singapore as he claimed that he was set up with "market aunties", China Press reported.
Xu had engaged the services of the agency after knowing about it via an advertisement on the Internet in December.
He paid S$2,400 to meet women through the agency, which claimed to have 3,500 members.
On his first date, Xu was to meet a woman at a high-class restaurant.
"She came in shorts and slippers!"
Xu was then set up with four other women but he complained about all of them.
"I wanted someone younger than me, slim, friendly and with long hair but they were all in their 30s.
"And they all left in a hurry after 15 minutes, saying they had to do some important things and left me to foot the bills," Xu said.
On Tuesday, he went to the agency's office to demand a refund.
