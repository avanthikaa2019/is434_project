Singapore and Brunei are collaborating to reduce roaming rates for mobile phone users by the first quarter of next year.
The telecoms regulators of both countries, the Authority of Info-communications Technology Industry of Brunei (AITI) and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), have been tasked to work with mobile operators to reduce the roaming rates. These include voice calls, SMS and data usage.
Singapore's Information, Communications and the Arts Minister Yaacob Ibrahim and Brunei's Communications Minister Abdullah Haji Bakar jointly announced this today during the annual Infocomm Media Business Exchange 2012.
"This collaboration seeks to provide cross-border communication at a lower cost for the people of Brunei and Singapore. It would also enhance and reduce the cost of doing business between the two countries," Mr Ibrahim said in his speech.
Both countries have co-operated closely on many issues. This year also marks the 45th anniversary of the Currency Inter-changeability Agreement between Singapore and Brunei.
