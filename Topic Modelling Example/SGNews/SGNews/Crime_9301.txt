SINGAPORE - A motorist who showed a taxi driver the middle finger has been sentenced to eight months in jail for breaking the cabby's middle finger.
S. Gopikrishnan, a credit collection officer, is appealing against the sentence and is currently out on $10,000 bail.
The 46-year-old was said to have caused Mr Pang Weng Fong to slam on his brakes when his car suddenly drove onto Bartley Road from Mount Vernon Road on the morning of May 3 last year.
The cabby sounded his horn and both men stopped their cars by the side of the road. Gopikrishnan then showed Mr Pang the middle finger.
When Mr Pang tried to take a picture, Gopikrishnan demanded for the camera and twisted Pang's middle finger so hard that it broke.
District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam said that Gopikrishnan had initiated the confrontation by getting out of his car to approach Pang.
She ordered Gopikrishnan to pay for Pang's medical expenses but spared him the cane as he is a diabetic and suffers from high blood pressure.
