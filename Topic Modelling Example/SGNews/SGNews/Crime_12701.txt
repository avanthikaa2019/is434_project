Police have arrested 6 men and 4 women, for using forged documents to apply for credit facilities from a local bank.
Between March and May 2012, the police received several reports from a local bank, which said that a number of applicants had used fictitious credentials such as forged CPF statements to apply for credit facilities.
The forgeries were discovered when the banks carried out checks on credit accounts that were in arrears.
Following these reports, police officers carried out a series of operations from March 14 to May 10, 2012.
They arrested 10 suspects at multiple locations island-wide.
Investigations revealed that these suspects would withdraw the full amount from the bank's credit facilities upon approval of their application.
A portion of the money would then be given to unknown associates who had assisted them in forging the required documents.
First-time offenders convicted of Forgery for the Purpose of Cheating can be punished with imprisonment of up to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
The police advises banks to practise vigilance by verifying the credentials with relevant authorities before any approval of credit facilities.
