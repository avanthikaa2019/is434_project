The logos and names of SPRING Singapore and its subsidiary, SPRING SEEDS Capital Pte Ltd has been used by Interesting Mart Pte Ltd without authorisation, said SPRING in a statement to the media.
SPRING, an agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has clarified that they do not allow the use of their logo or name as an endorsement of any company's product or services.
Furthermore, SPRING has had no part in the formation of Interesting Mart nor has Interesting Mart been awarded the "Spring Singapore Enterprise Fund".
SPRING has issued a lawyer's letter to the offending company requesting that the logos be taken down. The company has complied, SPRING said.
SPRING is the the enterprise development agency responsible for helping Singapore enterprises grow and building trust in Singapore products and services.
As such, SPRING works with partners to help enterprises in financing, capability and management development, technology and innovation, and access to markets.
Interesting Mart has released a statement on their website, explaining that they had a miscommunication with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, hence resulting in them using the SPRING Singapore logo on their website.
The owner, Nur Iman, said explained that the website won the Ngee Ann Enterprise Award, and misunderstood that the funds came from SPRING, since a lecturer involved in the award was connected to SPRING.
Nur Iman issued an apology to SPRING and its customers for his negligence.
