SINGAPORE - The undergraduate who attacked four police officers after having too much to drink has been sentenced to 15 months of probation and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service.
Natasha Wan Xue Wen, 24, pleaded guilty to using criminal force and abusive words on public servants, and behaving in disorderly manner.
Wan is also required to stay at home from 11pm to 6am during her probation period. Her parents signed a $5,000 bond to ensure her good behaviour.
She was warned by the district judge that anything other that strict adherence to these conditions could have her hauled back to court to be sentenced.
At about 4am on October 26 last year, two policemen saw a bouncer escorting Wan, her boyfriend Lim Zhao Ming, and another man out of Zouk.
Mr Lim had a cut, and bloodstains on his shirt. The two officers asked if he had been assaulted, and if he needed medical treatment.
Mr Lim shouted at the policemen, and Wan suddenly punched an officer in the face and began hurling vulgarities.
When two female police officers arrived to arrest Wan, she put up a struggle.
On the way to the police station, Wan head-butted one of the female officers and bit the other on the wrist and hand.
The officer who was bitten had to be warded in hospital for six days and given 13 days' medical leave.
