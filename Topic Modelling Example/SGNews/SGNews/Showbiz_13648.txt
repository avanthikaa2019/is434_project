MUARA, Brunei - Brunei's potential film industry should focus on its progress in development as opposed to its shortcomings.
Ng Boon Khee, co-founder of digital media technology and production company, Silicon Illusions said this yesterday.
Ng Boon Khee was one of the invited speakers for the Brunei Economic Development Board (BEDB) Creative Arts Facilities (CRAFT) Multimedia Seminar.
"I'm pretty sure that BEDB, iCentre and the other multimedia agencies are trying their best to create an infrastructure that will promote filmmaking here in Brunei," he said.
"I think you also have to recognise that at this stage, you are still considered a very young nation with not much resources."
Being one of the various partners for the initiative, Ng said that they will have to first assess and evaluate the situation before they identify the fields or areas that need further improvement.
He urged the local film industry to not worry too much about not being adequate or sufficient in being able to develop movies or animations, as external productions can assist and provide the necessary resources.
Such an opportunity was said to also allow external productions to be set up in Brunei.
He believes Bruneians would be more involved and would participate in other studios or productions that already are known regionally and try to develop themselves from there.
Similar thoughts were shared by fellow invited speaker Titus Ho, a Hong Kong-raised international film industry veteran, who said that he does not see a reason why Brunei should not be recommended to international productions as the Sultanate's landscapes and forestry were worthy of cinematic backdrops.
Yesterday's seminar was held at the iCentre Lobby and was the first in a series of activities, workshops and talks under the CRAFT initiative by BEDB, aimed at creating an eco-system that will foster local multimedia development through creating effective programmes.
