SINGAPORE - According to lawyers interviewed by The Straits Times (ST), the word "obtain" used in court documents indicate that former Singapore Civil Defence (SCDF) chief Peter Lim Sin Pang is likely to have been the party who brought up the sex proposition.
Lim faces 10 charges of engaging in sexual trysts with three women in return for favouring their companies during IT-related tenders held by the SCDF.
Criminal lawyer Mr Foo Cheow Ming pointed out that the word "accept" would have been used if the women were the ones who offered sex.
In legal terms, it is understood that when it says Lim 'obtained' gratification, it means he had asked the women for it, Mr Foo said.
Another unnamed source close to the investigations told ST that the use of the word would not have been without consideration and that it was "for a purpose".
The three women embroiled in the sex scandal are Ms Pang Chor Mui, a general manager at Nimrod Engineering; Ms Lee Wei Hoon, a director at Singapore Radiation Centre; and Miss Esther Goh Tok Mui, formerly a business-development director at NCS Pte Ltd.
Lim, who is married, is currently out on bail of $10,000 and his passport has been surrendered to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).
His case has been adjourned to July 5, when a pre-trial conference has been scheduled.
If convicted, he could be jailed up to five years and fined $100,000.
