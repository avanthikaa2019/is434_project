A Nigerian man was arrested by the Malaysian police in Kuala Lumpur and extradited to Singapore on April 11 for a spate of Internet love scams.
The 32-year-old is believed to be involved in a series of love scam cases which were reported to the police last year.
He allegedly befriended female victims through online dating and social networking sites, and developed a 'love' relationship with them.
He would promise to visit Singapore and on the day of arrival, he would contact the victims and inform them that he had been detained at the Checkpoint. He would then ask the victims to remit money to specified bank accounts to secure his release.
The suspect will be charged in court on April 13 and a court order will be sought to remand him for further investigations.
DAC Sam Tee, Commander Airport Police Division, expressed his gratitude to the Malaysian police "for the excellent cooperation and assistance rendered to the Singapore Police in effecting the arrest".
The police also reminded the public to remain vigilant against such scams and to inform the police immediately if anyone attempts to extort money.
The public should also be wary of messages from unknown people who want to befriend you, exercise caution when dealing with unknown persons "befriended" over the Internet, and do not remit or transfer money to people whom you do not know well enough.
The criminal may spend months building rapport with you online before asking for money, said the police.
Do not acede to any request that may put you in a vulnerable position, such as peforming comprising acts in front of a webcam, or give personal details about yourself.
