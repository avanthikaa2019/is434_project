KRAKOW, Poland - England manager Roy Hodgson admits the contrasting talents of Danny Welbeck and Andy Carroll have given him plenty of food for thought as he mulls his options to face France.
Manchester United striker Welbeck is believed to have edged ahead of Carroll in the race for a place in England's starting line-up for Monday's Group D game in Donetsk in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney.
The more mobile Welbeck served notice of his talent with a sublimely taken goal against Belgium earlier this month, with his speed seen as being better suited to England's counter-attacking gameplan.
However Hodgson revealed that while picking his back four and central midfielders had been straightforward, deciding on a partner for Ashley Young and picking his wide players had been more problematical.
