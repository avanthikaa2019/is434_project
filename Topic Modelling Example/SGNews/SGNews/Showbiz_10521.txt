Korean Joon Sik (Jang Dong Gun) and Japanese Tatsuo (Joe Odagiri) are marathon competitors in a sensitive time and place - Seoul under Japanese occupation in 1938.
After things go awry at one contest, Joon Sik is conscripted into the Japanese Imperial Army as punishment. It would be the first of several army uniforms that he dons as he seeks to stay alive in World War II.
Eventually, he crosses paths with Tatsuo again.
Director Kang Je Gyu handles the epic battle scenes with the kind of assurance you would expect from the man behind the Korean War blockbuster hit Taegukgi (2004).
He is able to zoom in and pan out, capturing the bewilderment of being in the thick of action and also conveying the devastating scale of destruction.
MY WAY (NC16) Drama/143 minutes Rating: 2/5 stars
