His Majesty the King yesterday assigned HRH Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn to perform royal ceremonies in making merits in dedication to HRH Princess Bejeratana and in placing her royal relics at the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall on his behalf.
The princess, the only child of King Rama VI, passed away last July.
Following the royal cremation earlier this week, her royal relics had been kept at the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. Both throne halls are located inside the Grand Palace.
The crown prince arrived at the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall at 10.30am. He was accompanied by his sister HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, his royal consort HRH Princess Srirasmi, and his daughter HRH Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana.
The meritmaking ceremony took place at the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall.
After food was presented to monks, the royal procession to bring the royal relics of HRH Princess Bejeratana to the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall followed.
The crown prince and HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn lit candles to show respect for the late princess at the Chakri maha Prasat Throne Hall before they left.
