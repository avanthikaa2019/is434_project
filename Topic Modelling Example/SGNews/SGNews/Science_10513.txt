Microsoft could use Kinect to deliver emotion-based advertising, based on a recent patent application filed.
The technology would give its Xbox 360 Kinect sensor the ability to read users' facial expressions and body language, said tech-news site BGR. This allows Microsoft to send them ads based on how they feel at that point in time.
