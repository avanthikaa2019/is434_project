KUALA LUMPUR - The long wait is over. Our very own Hollywood superstar Datuk Michelle Yeoh is returning to Malaysia on April 24 to promote her noteworthy biopic The Lady.
Based on the heartwarming story of Myanmar's democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, The Lady is directed by acclaimed French filmmaker Luc Besson, whose illustrious movie credits include La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element and The Transporter.
Sharing her experience of working closely with Suu Kyi for the movie, which led to her deportation from Myanmar in June last year, Yeoh told The Daily Chilli:
"When I went there, I was extremely nervous because I was afraid she would look at me and go, Oh my God, why are you portraying me?'
"But when she was in front of me, all she did was open up her arms and welcome me like a family member."
The former Bond girl also revealed that she had to lose 8kg to acquire the slender frame of the freedom fighter, who won the Nobel prize for her peace efforts.
During her whirlwind visit to Kuala Lumpur, Yeoh will be gracing the charity premiere of The Lady, hosted by Swiss Watch Extraordinaire, Richard Mille, at the GSC Pavilion KL.
The charity screening is in aid of Voice of the Children, a non-profit organisation for the welfare and protection of children in Malaysia that Yeoh personally champions.
The Lady, distributed by GSC Movies, will be released in selected cinemas in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh and Malacca on May 3.
