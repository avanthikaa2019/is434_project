SINGAPORE - A man who had sexually violated a six-year-old boy in July last year has been sentenced to eight years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane.
Khamis Dawi, 47, had admitted that to sexual abuse by penetrating a minor in July last year at a HDB block without his consent.
The victim and his seven-year-old sister were playing at the void deck when Khamis asked them to follow him.
Scared, the girl did not follow Khamis but stood by a nearby letter box and saw what Khamis did to her brother, said The Straits Times.
The report said that the incident only came to light when the victim was warded in hospital for stomach flu in August. It was there that his sister told a patient what she saw.
The victim's mother subsequently lodged a police report.
A psychiatrist assessment showed that the victim has low IQ and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Khamis, who has had previous convictions, is also believed to have a high risk of sexual re-offending.
