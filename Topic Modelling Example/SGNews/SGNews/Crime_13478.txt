A $4,000 fine has been slapped on a former lawyer who was found to have acted as an advocate and solicitor while suspended from practice.
The Straits Times reported that Low Yong Sen, 45, had been suspended between Sept 3, 2008 and March 2, 2009 by a Court of Three Judges. He had been found guilty for offences including overcharging clients.
However, in June 2009, he signed a deed of separation that was drafted for Mr Goh Sey Tee by management firm High Business Services operated by Low's brother.
In signing it, he included the phrase 'Advocate and Solicitor' which he was not allowed to do at that point in time due to his suspension. This means, he was not holding a practising certificate from the Law Society.
That same month, Mr Goh complained that he had engaged Mr Low's legal service while the latter was suspended.
Low was struck off the rolls in February 2010 for systematically overcharging clients. This includes a 2005 case where he was reprimanded and fined for overcharging a hawker three times more than what was reasonable in a divorce case.
