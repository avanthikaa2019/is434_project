ROME - Former Italy international Giorgio Chinaglia has died at his home in Florida of complications from a heart attack, aged 65, Italian press reports said Sunday.
A controversial character, he began his career with Swansea Town in 1964 as his family had moved to Wales several years earlier to find work.
But he soon moved back to Italy for military service, after which he joined Massese in Serie C - he was banned from playing in Serie A for three years due to having played professionally abroad.
He moved onto Internapoli before joining Serie A Lazio in 1969.
That was where he spent most of his career and he also earned a call up for the Italy team in 1972.
He played 14 times for his country, scoring four goals, and played at the 1974 World Cup, although his international career ended at that tournament following a bust-up with then coach Ferruccio Valcareggi.
In 1976 he moved to the United States and joined Pele and Franz Beckenbauer at the New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League where he scored a record 262 goals.
It was there that he earned the nickname "Long John" and after his career ended he remained in the country.
An arrest warrant was issued for Chinaglia in Italy in 2006 when he was implicated in an extortion probe at his former club Lazio, although he was never arrested as he remained in the United States.
He suffered a heart attack in late March but was released from hospital after undergoing surgery.
