The ZTE Grand X LTE (T82), recently unveiled at CommunicAsia 2012, is the Chinese company's first LTE smartphone to use a single-chip model.
The Qualcomm MSM8960 single-chip gives this flagship phone the edge in speed and energy efficiency compared to most of its competition on the market.
Operating on Android 4.0, aka the Ice Cream Sandwich, the T82 is powered by a 1.5 GHz dual-core CPU and has an eight-megapixel camera that is capable of shooting video in 1080p.
With a maximum download speed of 100Mbps, this buttonless phone is slated for fourth-quarter release here.
