Thousands of women from all over China rushed for a matchmaking event with 11 billionaires in Guangzhou, Nanyang Siang Pau reported.
Aged between 19 and 56, some of them came from as far as Singapore and Australia.
Over 2,800 women had to pass 11 tests set by experts in various fields such as physiognomy (face reading) and psychology before they would be considered by the billionaires.
Their family background, mental and body health conditions were also checked.
A candidate, identified only as Ah Ling, who recently graduated with a double Masters from an Australian university, said she came to register and get herself a billionaire husband.
"He is definitely better than me," said the 28-year-old who is currently attached to a research company.
