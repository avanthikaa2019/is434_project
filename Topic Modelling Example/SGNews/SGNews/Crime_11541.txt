A 30-year-old man killed his aged parents with a spade over what he felt was unfair distribution of their property.
His parents, known just as Bose, 61, and Pottiammal, 58, had divided their farm in Dindigul, about 250km south of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, between their sons Lingusamy and Venkateswaran, 32.
Malaysia Nanban reported that Lingusamy was not happy with his share and often quarrelled with his father, demanding for a bigger portion of the farm.
On Monday, Lingusamy went to his father in a drunken state and started a fight.
When his brother stepped in to ease the situation, he became even more furious, prompting him to pick up a spade and attack his father.
When their mother tried to shield Bose, Lingusamy also attacked her.
Both the parents collapsed in a pool of blood.
A shocked Venkateswaran rushed out to seek help while Lingusamy ran away.
