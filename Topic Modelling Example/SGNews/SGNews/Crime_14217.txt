SINGAPORE - Twenty motorists were arrested for drink-driving yesterday during the islandwide anti-drink-driving operation set up by the Traffic Police (TP).
Road blocks were set up from 12am to 4.30am along major roads such as Upper Bukit Timah Road, Clemenceau Avenue and Keppel Road, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in a statement to the media.
All the motorists arrested failed the breathalyser test, with the highest test result clocking in at 69 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 mililitres of breath, almost two times the prescribed legal limit.
Drinking and driving is a serious offence, and on conviction, drink drivers will be disqualified from driving for at least a year.
First time offenders can be fined between $1,000 - $5,000 or jailed up to six months. Repeat offenders may be punished with a maximum fine of $30,000 and a mandatory jail term of up to three years. They may also receive six strokes of the cane if they cause death or serious injury.
"Motorists should never take chances. Do not drive if you have consumed alcohol. The penalties are harsh. So, be wise," warns Commander of Traffic Police, Assistant Commissioner of Police Cheang Keng Keong.
