KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian pop star Winnie K has set the local entertainment scene abuzz with her sexy lingerie ads.
The singer, known for her squeaky clean image, shows some skin in the latest ads for Japanese lingerie maker ELV.
In the ELV promo series, the well-endowed Winnie flaunts her assets in exquisitely-designed bras and bodysuits.
The ads have shocked her large fan base in Malaysia and Indonesia, whom she won over with her commercially successful Malay album, Kau Ada Di Mana.
While top Malay entertainment portal www.murai.com.my describes the ads as "inappropriate", popular Singapore portals like Yahoo! Singapore and www.asiaone.com are playing up sizzling stories regarding the issue.
But Winnie maintains that her undergarment ads have been tastefully done.
"It's nothing sleazy," the 30-year-old told The Daily Chilli.
Winnie, who was endorsing the brand for the second year after a friend introduced her to it in 2010, said lingerie was something essential for women and that the ads should not be viewed negatively.
"Think positive. It's not that I'm wearing my bra and underwear in public. It's just for the print ads."
She also said her family had seen the ads.
"I discussed it with my family and they are quite open-minded about it."
