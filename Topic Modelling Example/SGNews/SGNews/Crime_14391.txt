KLANG, Malaysia - A 36-year-old disabled Singaporean woman claimed trial at a Sessions Court here for allegedly trafficking a 22-day-old baby boy.
Lee Hwee Bin, who is one-legged, was brought to the court on a wheelchair to face the charge before judge Nur Syaridah Awang yesterday.
Lee was accused of trafficking the baby for exploitation, in exchanging the baby for money outside a Starbucks Coffee outlet in Jusco Bukit Tinggi at 11.30am on April 4.
She was charged under Section 14 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act 2007 which carries a 20-year jail term and a fine if convicted.
DPP Aimi Syazwani Sarmin did not offer bail because the accused was a foreigner and had failed to produce her passport.
The court fixed May 24 for case mention. Lee was represented by lawyer K. Muthiah.
Earlier this month, it was reported that two babies - a 22-day-old and another three-month-old - were rescued from a baby-for-sale syndicate when police arrested four women at the shopping mall.
The police said many photos of the babies were found in a mobile phone belonging to a woman, including messages indicating transactions had taken place.
The 22-day-old was found with his birth certificate and passport, while the other baby, also a boy, had no documentation.
The babies were sent to Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital for DNA testing and medical check-up before they were handed over to the Welfare Department.
