Cat cafes will likely be allowed to operate until 10 pm despite new rules that prohibit the display of dogs and cats after 8 p.m., Environment Ministry officials have said.
Due to revisions in the Animal Protection Law, pet shops will not be allowed to display dogs and cats after 8 pm from June 1. A subpanel on animal protection at the ministry's Central Environment Council has been discussing the handling of cat cafes.
The new rules are meant to prohibit display and sales practices that cause stress for young animals. They also applied to cat cafes--establishments where customers can play with cats in a relaxed atmosphere--but cafe owners complained to the ministry that cats are nocturnal animals and therefore can move around freely and experience less stress at night.
The subcommittee approved the ministry's plan to relax regulations if cat cafe operators fulfill certain conditions, including:
-- Cats are aged 1 year or older.
-- They can move around freely.
-- They have free access to rest spaces.
The necessity of regulating cat cafes and similar establishments will be examined again after a two-year transitional period during which stress on cats and other problems will be investigated, the officials said.
"We greatly appreciate that the panel understood our opinions and will think about whether our industry should impose its own regulations on operations," said Takafumi Fukui, the head of an organization preparing for the establishment of a cat cafe federation of major cat cafe operators.
