It's normally the parent that gives the offspring away at a wedding.
But this particular one was different - the 14 year-old daughter of 35-year-old singer Nurul Wahab, "gave away' her mum at the akad nikah ceremony on June 6.
"Now I don't have to worry about my mum anymore. I feel quite relieved actually," said the proud daughter Ayu Nazirah, sounding more like a responsible parent than a carefree teenage daughter.
Ayu, who is at a boarding school In Johor Baru, was worried about her mum when she was at school, as her divorced mother stays in the Klang Valley.
"I really feel relieved that there is someone there for her," she said.
Nurul married Herbalife distributor Eric Depp on June 6, who jokes that he's "not sure if he's related to Johnny."
(Herbalife is a company that manufacturers and distributes nutrition drinks.)
"I met Nurul to explain the nutrition product to her. But then we met again and again and again&hellip;and here we are," he said at the ceremony, looking all dapper in a Bon Zainal suit..
Nurul and new hubby Eric will be doing the dance of life together.
Most children are not so welcoming to step-parents, but not Ayu. She love her step-dad to bits.
"I liked Eric immediately. He looked like someone who was trustworthy and responsible. I now have stepfather I can look up to," she says.
And what about following in her mum's career footsteps, who had hits like Kerana Terluka and Selagi Ada Cinta.
"No plans to sing yet! I want to be A Herbalife distributor" she says.
Boy, talk about running in the family&hellip;
Before settling down with her 47-year-old French beau, back in 2010, Nurul was married to composer Ajai.
The 11-year-old marriage ended in 2007.
