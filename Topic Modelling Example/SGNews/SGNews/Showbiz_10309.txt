Emma Watson is again sandwiched between two male co-stars.
But this time she has ditched her Hogwarts uniform for an all-American high school blazer.
The British actress shares the big screen with US actors Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller - the former playing her love interest and the latter, her gay step-brother.
Based on the critically acclaimed novel by Stephen Chbosky, who also wrote and directed this adaptation, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower revolves around Charlie (Lerman), an introverted high school freshman navigating adolescence with the help of new friends Sam (Watson) and Patrick (Miller).
Last seen in My Week With Marilyn, where she had a small part playing Marilyn Monroe's wardrobe assistant, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower will be a test to see if Watson can stand on her own outside the enthralling Harry Potter universe.
As seen in the trailer, she has an uncharacteristically provocative scene where she danced in a The Rocky Horror Picture Show production wearing skimpy black lingerie, complete with a feather boa.
It will also be the first time that Watson is sporting an American accent on film.
The 22-year-old credited her co-stars for helping her nail it.
"I worked with a voice coach, and I also hung out with the guys," she told MTV.
"(Logan and Ezra) were very supportive and they told me when I said things that didn't really sound right."
For Lerman, 20, the perk for him was to be able to kiss Watson.
He told MTV: "It's kind of odd when you're doing it for a movie. It's weird. We did it a few times. She's cool, so it wasn't as awkward as it could have been. And it's Emma Watson, so I'm a lucky guy." - Joanne Soh
Emma Watson and Logan Lerman will reunite for Darren Aronofsky's Noah.
Ezra Miller is a trained opera singer.
Watson has a short-lived romance with co-star Johnny Simmons, who played a high school jock.
