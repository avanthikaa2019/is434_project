Parkson's 25th anniversary celebration offered an interesting suggestion on what ladies should wear on a hot summer night!
We men agree, after all, it is a very hot season...Practicality rules, right guys?
The event was held at the swanky Chiao! Restaurant, where there were special guests, food, wine and of course... a fashion show with err ...some minimalistic designs..
The event was to highlight Parkson's summer theme, called Summer Breeze.
Under Summer Breeze, there are billowing maxi dresses. floral printed shirts, fuss free tees and khaki shorts.
There were brands like Desigual (exclusively at Parkson), Monsoon, DKNY Jeans, French Connection, Wallis, Miss Selfridge (new in Parkson), United Colors of Benetton (exclusively at Parkson), Mirabelle Key Ng (an exclusive item just for Parkson) and more under the Summer Breeze theme.
Music was played by TV host and DJ Patricia K.
