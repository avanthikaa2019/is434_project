Nine Gurkha officers have been arrested by the police for suspected involvement in a fight at Clarke Quay last Sunday morning.
One of them was charged in court this week for causing grievous hurt.
The Straits Times reported that the nine suspects were all junior officers from the Police Gurkha Contingent (GC).
They have been removed from their posts pending further investigation.
A police spokesperson said the incident happened at 3.35am on April Fool's Day when the Gurkha officers were off duty.
The Gurkha Contingent's commander Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Ross Forman said the contingent will take a tough stance on the incident.
He told local media that the GC takes a very serious view of the conduct of this small group of officers who have tarnished the contingent's good reputation.
He also said that such behaviour is unacceptable and the officers will be severely punished if found guilty.
The victim has not been identified.
The police spokesperson said the police are keeping in close contact with the victim's family and will give them help if needed.
Anyone who runs afoul of the law, including the police force's own officers, will be sternly dealt with, she added.
The officer can be jailed up to 10 years and caned if found guilty of voluntarily causing grievous hurt.
