AUGUSTA, Georgia - Tiger Woods has found the form that made him a 14-time Major winner, but the 36-year- old also finds himself outdriven by younger, larger rivals and giving US Masters advice to newcomers.
He teed off yesterday morning at Augusta National for the 76th Masters, seeking a fifth green jacket, his first Major win since the 2008 US Open, and to get a step closer to the record 18 Major titles won by Jack Nicklaus.
After Woods won his first Major title 15 years ago at Augusta, courses became longer and players became stronger to meet the challenge he posed.
Now on the comeback trail in a world he created, Woods comes into the Masters having snapped a 21/2-year US PGA win drought last month at Bay Hill in the aftermath of injuries and an infamous sex scandal.
With a victory on Sunday, Woods could match Nicklaus for second on the all-time PGA win list with a 73rd overall crown, nine shy of Sam Snead's all-time record.
"I would like the green jacket more," he said. "I know the 73 titles (record) would be a by- product of it, but I'm here for the green jacket."
He is also at Augusta to dispense advice, just as he had learnt secrets of the course from Arnold Palmer and Nicklaus in bygone days.
Recalling a practice round with Nicklaus in 1995 as an amateur, Woods said: "Jack told me some of the putts he hit over the years, the strategy on how to play certain flags... At the time, it was all about the different angles."
Now, he finds himself being asked for advice by rivals such as his Tuesday-playing partner, Sean O'Hair.
"I do help them," Woods said.
"It's not something that we hold and are going to keep sacred. We pass it on from one generation to the next."
