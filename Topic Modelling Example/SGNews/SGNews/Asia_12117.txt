LONDON - Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is to be awarded an honorary doctorate by Britain's prestigious Oxford University, her alma mater announced Thursday.
The democracy icon will receive a doctorate in civil law on June 20, a day after her 67th birthday, during her first trip abroad in more than two decades.
She will address both houses of the British parliament the following day in an honour bestowed on only a few world leaders.
&ldquo;We are delighted that Daw Suu is finally able to return to the university and are looking forward greatly to what will be a very special occasion,&rdquo; said Oxford vice-chancellor Professor Andrew Hamilton.
Suu Kyi read philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford's St Hugh's College from 1964 to 1967 and settled in the southern English city with her husband before returning to Myanmar in 1988.
