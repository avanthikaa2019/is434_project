HUSBANDS in Singapore who fear their wives and want "time off" to meet their male friends have to fill up a form available on the Internet.
Entitled "application for outing permit", the form is addressed to "the supreme Home Minister" (wife), Sin Chew Daily reported.
The form has blanks for the men to fill in the date, time and location of the outing.
It also states that the outing is for the usual "yumcha" (tea), TT (teh tarik) or drinking with the guys.
It also gives the reason for the outing as to "keep in touch with guys and share our stories (no ogling at girls)".
The form ends with a note to the wife Ps: honey, I will take you anywhere and buy anything you want during the weekend. I love you."
An official in the republic described having to resort to filling up such a form as "extreme" and that communication between spouses need not be penned in black and white.
