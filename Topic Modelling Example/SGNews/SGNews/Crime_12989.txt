BUTTERWORTH: A Chinese temple committee chairman was shot at least three times by a lone gunman in Jalan Raja Uda here but managed to survive the attack.
The 49-year-old was watching television with two friends at the temple in Taman Teratai when a man wearing a jacket and helmet approached him from the back and suddenly opened fire, hitting his body.
OCPD Asst Comm Zulkifli Alias said the assailant fled on a motorcycle that was parked outside the temple, adding that the victim's friends could not do anything as they feared being shot, too.
"The victim, who also worked as a part-time caretaker at the temple, was rushed to the Seberang Jaya Hospital where his condition has been described as stable," he said.
"We are trying to determine the motive behind the shooting which has been classified as attempted murder under Section 307 of the Penal Code," he said yesterday.
ACP Zulkifli said three bullet casings were found at the scene of the shooting that occurred at about 11.55pm on Saturday.
"We are appealing to witnesses or those with information on the incident to come forward," he said.
"They can call me (019-666 9999) or any police station."
