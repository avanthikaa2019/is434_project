The Singapore Zoo has recently welcomed four new baby kangaroos, allowing visitors to see animals not usually found in our climate.
The two Eastern grey kangaroos and two Agile wallabies are the newest additions to the Australian Outback - a zone dedicated to showcasing creatures from Down Under.
Bella, an Eastern grey who lost her mother earlier this year, is close to 12 months old now.
The Singapore Zoo said Bella is coping well now despite showing signs of depression in the first few days of her mother's demise.
Another Eastern grey, Tayla, gave birth in December last year and is currently nursing a joey in her pouch.
With the addition of the two Agile wallaby babies, the total collection at the Australian Outback is now 10.
Known also as sandy wallabies, one of the new babies have been named "Krookie" by the staff at the zoo.
While the latest kangaroos and wallabies are not endangered species, Assistant Director of Zoology of the Singapore Zoo Alagappasamy Chellaiyah said their presence was still important.
"(They) allow visitors to see animals not usually found in our climate and learn more about wildlife in general," he said.
"In the long run, we hope to cultivate a love for the environment and all creatures, endangered or not," he added.
Feed-a-Roo sessions, where visitors to the zoo can feed and interact with the animals, take place every day at 11.00am and 4.00pm.
Visitors may also stop by a new exhibit of the endangered Goodfellow's tree kangaroos. The pair of Goodfellows, natives to Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea, are classified as endangered in the wild as they are mainly threatened by human activities such as hunting and encroachment in their natural habitats.
Other highlights at the Australian Outback include the cassowary and carpet python.
