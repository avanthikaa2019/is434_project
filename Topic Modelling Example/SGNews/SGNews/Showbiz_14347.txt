SEOUL - Rumors are spreading about US actress Jessica Alba signing business deals with Korean companies during her unexpected Seoul trip. Alba was spotted at Kolon's fashion unit in Gangnam on Monday and also at a celebrity party hosted by CJ E&amp;M vice chairwoman Lee Mi-kyung later in the evening, according to reports.
Kolon is one of the country's leading textile and fashion companies and creates products for fashion and accessories brands like Couronne, Qua and Elord. CJ E&amp;M is the entertainment and media arm of CJ Group, which owns several cable channels and movie and online game production companies.
The 30-year-old celebrity had an interview with the country's renowned emcee Baek Ji-yeon on the same day at CJ E&amp;M's head office in Sangam-dong. CJ officials confirmed that the taping of "Baek Ji-yeon's People Inside," took place on Monday afternoon, but did not reveal when the show will air.
Korean emcee Baek, known to be a friend of Alba's, requested the interview with the American celebrity on a visit to her hotel in Gangnam. The celebrity okayed her request without hesitation, according to reports.
A CJ official said Alba and the CJ vice chairwoman know each other and that Alba attended the party at the invitation of the chairwoman.
"We have no idea how they became friends," the official added.
Alba, who is currently in Korea on holiday with her family, surprised her fans here by visiting a club and a bar with her husband Cash Warren in southern Seoul over the weekend.
The Hollywood star's surprise visit to Seoul was exposed online shortly after on Twitter along with pictures taken by people at the club in Nonhyeon-dong and the Apgujeong-dong bar.
