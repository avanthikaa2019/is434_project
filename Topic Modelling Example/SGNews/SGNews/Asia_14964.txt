SEOUL - South Korea will end an operation Tuesday to retrieve debris from North Korea's failed rocket launch as no progress has been made, the defence ministry said.
The operation began on Friday after the North's rocket exploded in mid-air shortly after blast-off and its debris came down in the Yellow Sea. Warships from China, Russia and the United States have also combed a wide area.
South Korean officials said the operation involving naval ships and helicopters has been hampered by muddy waters.
"No debris has been found and the operation will end officially at 5:00 pm (0800 GMT)," a defence ministry spokesman told AFP.
North Korea warned before its rocket launch that any attempt to retrieve debris would face "ruthless" retaliation.
Pyongyang said the rocket was intended to place a satellite in orbit for peaceful research purposes but Western critics and Seoul said the launch was a thinly veiled ballistic missile test, banned by United Nations resolutions.
