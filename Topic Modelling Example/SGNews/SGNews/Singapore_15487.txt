Suburban shopping centres are becoming new community hangouts and mall developers like Frasers Centrepoint are stepping up to meet this demand.
Take, for example, Changi City Point, its 10th mall, which officially opened yesterday.
Besides factory-outlet shops and dining options, the mall has several outdoor features. These include a tree-house trail for children, a landscaped rooftop garden for shoppers to chill out in, and an amphitheatre for community activities.
The mall also sports art installations, including those by local artist Edwin Cheong. A 12m chandelier, made up of 8,000 recycled bottles, serves as the mall's centrepiece.
At least nine million visitors are expected to visit the mall each year, said Frasers.
