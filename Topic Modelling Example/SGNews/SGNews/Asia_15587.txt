NEW DELHI - India will not allow additional cotton exports for the current year ending in September as of now, Trade Minister Anand Sharma said on Monday.
"Until further orders, there will not be fresh registrations," Sharma said after a panel of ministers met to review cotton exports from India, after the world's second-largest producer banned shipments of the fibre last month.
Government and trade sources said last month India was unlikely to allow new cotton exports at the ministers' meet and may not lift the ban at least until July.
