A man held his girlfriend hostage at gunpoint in a bus parked in front of the Din Daeng Police Station in Bangkok yesterday morning.
The man, later identified as Thon Srichum, said he held Pornthip Duangtaya hostage because she refused continue their relationship. Police brought the hostage drama safely to an end after two hours.
Nobody was injured because the bus driver was quick in evacuating the vehicle. During interrogation, Thon said he had been dating Pornthip for a year, and that she visited him in Nakhon Pathom frequently. However, she recently decided to break up because she found out he was already married.
In her testimony, Pornthip's sister Panitha Duangtaya said Thon threatened Pornthip with a gun when she tried to break up the affair and then abducted her.
Thon faces charges of kidnapping and attempted murder.
