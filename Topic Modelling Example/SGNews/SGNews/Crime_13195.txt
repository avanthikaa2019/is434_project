A man believed to be involved in a snatch theft case at Tiong Bahru Road has been arrested.
The 46-year-old man was apprehended at Harbourfront Centre at about 11.40pm on May 9, a month after a 62-year-old woman reported to the police that her necklace worth $3,000 was snatched.
The suspect will be charged in court on Friday for theft. If found guilty, he faces a jail term of up to seven years and caning.
