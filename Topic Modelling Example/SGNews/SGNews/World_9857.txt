PARIS - The city of Paris is launching low cost funeral services from next month but will not skimp on quality for the final journey, officials said Thursday.
"Funerals are very expensive.... costing 3,098 euros (around S$5,087) on average," said Marinette Bache, the head of the city's funeral services, adding that it's cheapest offer would be 789 euros before taxes.
The package comprises charges for a coffin, headstone and hearse and does not include charges for a final resting place and the actual burial costs, she said.
The service will be launched on July 2.
"We will ensure quality service with the same vehicles, the same personnel used in classic services ... the coffins are of very good quality of solid pine," said Francois Michaud Nerard, another official.
