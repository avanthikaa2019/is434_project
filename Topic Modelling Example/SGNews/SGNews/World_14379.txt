SAO PAULO - Brazil's former president and current Senate leader Jose Sarney, 81, was released from a hospital late Tuesday after treatment for heart failure.
He was hospitalized 10 days ago and underwent catheterization and angioplasty, Sarney's doctors reported.
"Senator Jose Sarney was discharged from Sirio-Libanes Hospital," where he was being treated, the hospital said in a statement. "The patient is doing well."
Sarney, a politician and writer from the northeastern state of Maranhao, was Brazil's first civilian president after the military dictatorship of 1964 to 1985.
He is a member of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party.
Sarney ran as a vice presidential candidate along with Tancredo Neves, who was elected president but died before he was sworn into office. Sarney took over the job in his place, serving as president of Brazil from March 1985 to March 1990.
He owns a number of newspapers and television stations in the state of Maranhao, where he also served as governor.
