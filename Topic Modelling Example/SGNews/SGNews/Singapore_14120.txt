SINGAPORE - A group of Malaysians living in Singapore has launched an online signature drive in support of Saturday's Bersih rally in Kuala Lumpur (KL).
They planned to submit a petition to the Malaysian High Commissioner in Singapore, reported Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia's Chinese newspaper.
Their petition calls for the Malaysian government to implement the eight proposals that were put forward to them by the organisers of Bersih 2.0.
Mr Wang Yuansheng, one of the leaders of the petition drive, said that the message they want to send is that the Malaysian government has to hold its elections in a clean and fair manner.
Besides submitting the petition to the Malaysian High Commissioner in Singapore, several Malaysians living in Singapore also planned to take part in a rally at the JB City Square today.
It is one of the many smaller rallies that have taken place across Malaysia in support of the main Bersih 3.0 rally in KL.
The Bersih 3.0 rally in KL came to an ugly end when police had to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse a crowd that is rumoured to be about 50,000.
