TUNIS - A Tunisian court on Thursday slapped a small fine on the director of the Nessma television station for undermining morality by screening the film &ldquo;Persepolis,&rdquo; which showed depictions of God.
Nabib Karoui broadcast the award-winning Franco-Iranian film which recounts the Iranian revolution and its aftermath through the eyes of a young girl, on October 7 last year.
The screening prompted attacks on the station's offices and Karoui's home by activists linked to Salafism, a conservative strand of Islam.
In its ruling, the court ordered Karoui to pay 2,400 dinars (S$2,140) for &ldquo;broadcasting a film that disturbs public order and threatens proper morals.&rdquo;
A Nessma technician and another station official were both fined 1,200 dinars.
Karoui, who was not in court for the judgement, has described his case as a key test for freedom of expression in Tunisia, which remains in flux following the January 2011 revolution that toppled an entrenched dictatorship and sparked the Arab Spring.
Following a final hearing last month, he said &ldquo;the judgment will be historic and will have an effect on the entire region.&rdquo;
Tunisia is now led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party that won the most seats in October elections, the first polls since ex-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was toppled.
