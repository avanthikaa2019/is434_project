PARIS - Japan's Kei Nishikori pulled out of the French Open on Tuesday having failed to recover from a stomach injury, the world number 18 revealed on his Facebook page.
The 22-year-old made history earlier this year when he became the first Japanese man to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals, but his preparations for Paris were hit by the stomach injury he suffered in Barcelona in April.
He was subsequently forced to skip the Madrid and Rome Masters.
"I am very disappointed that I won't be able to play in Paris this year," said Nishikori.
"Following the last Grand Slam, I was looking forward to playing in the second Grand Slam of the year. I will continue my rehab and plan to be back on the Tour as early as I can."
Nishikori is the second top 20 player to pull out of the French Open after American number 10 Mardy Fish opted not to play because of fatigue.
Two-time runner-up Robin Soderling is another absentee as the Swede battles mononucleosis which has kept him off tour since July last year.
The French Open gets underway at Roland Garros on Sunday.
