SINGAPORE - Last night, Singapore hosted the inaugural Red Bull BC One South East Asian Cypher at the Far East Square Pavilion.
At the competition, 16 B-Boys, representing Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines battled in a 1-on-1 knock-out format to an audience of 500 local and regional spectators.
Homegrown hero, B-Boy Gerald, finished second place. B-Boy Juicy (22, Malaysia) and B-Boy Wild Son (12, Indonesia) took the first and third spots respectively.
The trio will represent their countries in the New Zealand qualifiers on Sept 1. B-boying is also known as breakdancing, which is a form of street dance.
They were judged by a panel of three renowned international B-Boys made up of Red Bull BC One All Stars Cico (Italy) and Pelezinho (Brazil) as well as B-Boy Wing (Korea).
The winner of the New Zealand qualifier will compete at the Red Bull BC One grand stage in Rio De Janeiro at the end of the year.
B-Boy Gerald said, "I will practice every day to show everyone at the New Zealand qualifiers that Singapore has good B-Boys too."
Since its birth in 2004, the Red Bull BC One has become the premier competition in the world of B-Boying.
Red Bull BC One All Star Cico (Italy), one of the judges, said of the event, "Because it is such a young scene, B-Boying in Asia can only grow bigger and competitions like Red Bull BC One Cyphers will help give them the competitive edge that they need to keep them sharp and on their feet.
