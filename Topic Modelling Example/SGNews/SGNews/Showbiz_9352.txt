Moral of the story, after watching the music video of Marilyn Manson's latest song, No Reflection?
Never attend a party organised by the ashen-faced, lipstick-wearing shock rocker, who fronts his eponymous industrial metal band.
No Reflection, the first single taken off Manson's latest album, Born Villain, starts off all posh and elegant, with scenes of a decadent feast - complete with a bevy of sexy babes clinking wine glasses - at his dark, grand mansion.
But in classic Manson fashion (read: controversial and twisted), all hell breaks loose.
The dinner table levitates mysteriously, guests start smashing furniture, bleeding and vomiting, while the host himself wraps up the terrifying night by dunking a woman's head in the toilet bowl.
You can always count on Manson for gore and grossness.
