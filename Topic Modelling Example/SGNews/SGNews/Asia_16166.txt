SEOUL - North Korea and Russia will reopen a cross-border railway in October after four years of work, Pyongyang's official news agency said Monday.
From that month freight trains will start running between Russia's Far East city of Khasan and the port at Rason, the North's northeastern free trade zone, the agency cited a top railway official as saying.
Work on repairing the 54-kilometre (32-mile) line began in October 2008.
It will connect to the Trans-Siberian Railway and help boost economic cooperation and relations between the two countries, the agency said.
The cross-border rail link is part of Russia's efforts to expand a foothold in the isolated nation. It is also building a cargo terminal in the Rason zone, formerly known as Rajin and Sonbong, which were two towns.
China has also been actively exploring investment opportunities in Rason and plans to build a separate cross-border rail link from Hunchun.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported in February that China had agreed to invest about S$3.8 billion in developing Rason as an export base.
The impoverished North is striving to revitalise its economy through foreign investment in Rason, which was declared a special economic zone in 1991 but failed to flourish.
