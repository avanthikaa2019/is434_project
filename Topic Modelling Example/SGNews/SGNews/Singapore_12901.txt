The Government has already started to address problems of insufficient bus services serving towns such as Sembawang, said Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo.
This is being done with 40 bus routes it is introducing. The additional routes will bump up the current 261 bus routes islandwide by a "significant" 15 per cent, she said. She added that the authorities will do its best to meet various requests.
Mrs Teo was replying to MP for Nee Soon GRC Lim Wee Kiak, who said the number of bus ser- vices to residents in estates such as Sembawang, Yishun and Woodlands is vastly unproportionate.
For example, there are 68,100 residents who live in Sembawang Town but only five bus services catering to their needs, translating to 13,620 residents on each bus service.
