High-flying actress Rozita Che Wan, who is rumoured to be marrying the husband of another famous diva, said she would sue those who spread the "wild and malicious" rumours.
The single mother is also sore that the rumour mongers had accused her 14-year-old son of running away from home because he was against her alleged plan to marry Datuk Khalid Mohd Jiwa, the husband of Datuk Siti Nurhaliza.
Speaking to Mega Hits, the entertainment section of Utusan Malaysia, Rozita said her son had only sulked after a small misunderstanding between them.
Rozita, 39, said she had never met Datuk K, as Khalid is popularly known, and was puzzled why she was being linked to him.
She said the gossip had been making the rounds for over two years in the media and blogs.
"They (the rumour mongers) should respect the feelings of others," she said, adding that she would sue the culprits as a lesson to others.
The divorced woman can take another candidate as a husband but if the next marriage also ends up in a divorce, she is considered an eligible single woman and, under Islamic law, her first husband can seek her hand in marriage.
Using this technicality, Harian Metro reported that some ex-husbands were willing to pay another man to become the cina buta so that it would be legal for the first husband to reconcile with her.
"I have been offered three times to be a cina buta," said 31-year-old Ramli, who boasted he was paid up to RM10,000(S$4,106) each time.
He is among a group of men who offer their services through the Internet to desperate husbands who had divorced thier wives on talak tiga and sought to marry them again.
