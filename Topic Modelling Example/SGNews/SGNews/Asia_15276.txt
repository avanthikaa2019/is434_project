TOKYO - North Korea's rocket launch was a "grave provocation" that ran foul of numerous United Nations resolutions, Japan said Friday after Pyongyang's apparently unsuccessful blast off.
"Even if it was a failure, it is a grave provocation to our country and other countries concerned and violates UN Security Council resolutions," Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said.
"We made strict protest through diplomatic channels."
North Korea launched a long-range rocket that appears to have disintegrated soon after blast off and fallen into the sea, South Korean and Japanese authorities said.
"We have not got the final confirmation that it was a missile," said Fujimura, "but at least we have the judgement that a flying object was launched and it failed."
The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Friday "to decide its next step" following the launch, a UN diplomat said.
North Korea has said the rocket would place a satellite in orbit for peaceful research purposes, but Western critics say the launch was a ruse for a ballistic missile test, banned by United Nations resolutions.
