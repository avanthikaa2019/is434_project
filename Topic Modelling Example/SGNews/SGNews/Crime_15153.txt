A secret society leader who had been on the run for 12 years was jailed for seven years by a district court yesterday.
Chan Heng Kee fled Singapore after a gang clash at Newton Food Centre in 1999 that left one man dead.
He first went to Malaysia, then to Thailand and finally to the Netherlands, where he remained for more than 10 years.
Chan returned to Singapore in May last year because he missed his home and family, and was arrested at Changi Airport.
Straits Times.com reported that the 51-year-old bachelor had pleaded guilty in March to voluntarily causing grievous hurt and causing hurt with a dangerous weapon.
Then, a district court heard that Chan and his accomplices attacked three men believed to have been members of a rival secret society.
The fight broke out at about 3.30am on Oct 22, 1999, after Devadas Paneerselum, 29, and his friends quarrelled with a member of Chan's gang.
Chan and five or six accomplices - some of whom were armed with knives and parangs - shouted and charged at Devadas and his friends. Chan himself was armed with a knife.
In the fight, Devadas was stabbed in the thigh and lost a large amount of blood. When Chan heard shouts that the police were coming, he threw the knife into a dustbin and fled in a taxi with an accomplice.
Devadas died shortly after police officers arrived.
Chan left Singapore at 7am later that day and lived overseas until his arrest last year.
