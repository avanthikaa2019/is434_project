SINGAPORE - Mendaki Chairman and Minister for Communication Information and the Arts, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, says the Malay self-help group will likely run into deficit after expanding the reach of its Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) scheme.
Dr Yaacob says it may need to cut some of its programmes, dip into its reserves, or find new sources of revenue three years from now, reported The Straits Times.
Dr Yaacob is also Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs.
The Government announced changes to the eligibility criteria for the subsidy, enabling at least two-thirds of Malay families to be able to qualify for the subsidy of 50 per cent or more, of the tertiary education fees.
Dr Yaacob said the changes has led to double the number families eligible for the full subsidy, and more are expected to apply.
Mendaki received $30 million in grants for the TTFS last year and dispensed $15 million of it, a figure that is forecast to rise to "at least $20 million" this year, said Dr Yaacob.
