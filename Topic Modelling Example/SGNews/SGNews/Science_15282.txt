POSCO CEO Chung Joon-yang agreed with Google Inc. executive chairman Eric Schmidt to strengthen long-term cooperation for technological development by combining the IT giant's innovative technologies with the steelmaker's business capacities.
The two met during Chung's return visit to Google headquarters in San Francisco on Tuesday, following up on a memorandum of understanding the companies signed in November to share info-tech and corporate values after Schmidt's visit to POSCO.
POSCO said Thursday it agreed to apply Google's mapping and three-dimensional technologies in its facilities and logistics, as well as Google's search, voice recognition and mobile solutions in its new management system named POSPIA 3.0.
The two CEOs agreed to continue exploring areas for additional collaboration. After the MOU signing in November, POSCO staff met with their counterparts in Google twice to benchmark the IT company's real-time cooperation method for POSPIA 3.0 and share each other's human resource systems for employment, compensation and education.
POSCO and Google plan more exchanges to share innovative work methods for cooperation, work hour management, intra-company communities and cutting meeting hours, in addition to a creative corporate culture, the steelmaker said.
