VATICAN CITY - Pope Benedict XVI has founded the first structure in Australia to encompass disaffected Episcopalian Anglicans who wish to join the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican said Friday.
The "Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross" - the equivalent of a nationwide diocese - will be led by Harry Entwistle, 72, who was an Anglican regional bishop and priest in Perth before joining the Catholic Church.
There are 12.6 million Australian Christians, 5.1 million of whom are Catholic, while 3.7 million are Anglican.
It is the third "Ordinariate" after Britain and the United States.
At the end of 2009, Benedict made it easier for Anglicans who opposed the direction Anglicanism was taking - particularly on topics such as homosexuality and the ordination of women - to convert to Catholicism.
The "Ordinariate" means Anglicans and former Anglicans who want to switch to the Catholic Church can retain some of their customs and liturgical traditions.
The initiative has aggravated tensions between the two Churches.
The Anglicans split from Rome in 1534 after pope Clement VII refused to grant King Henry VIII a divorce, and they accuse the Vatican of unwillingness for dialogue.
The Vatican has said that in welcoming converts, it is just responding to demand from disaffected Anglicans.
