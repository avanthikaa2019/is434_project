SINGAPORE - The Housing Board (HDB) has started a new, annual week-long islandwide campaign aimed at encouraging residents to bond with each other in order to build community spirit.
Called Community Week, the campaign will feature events in the heartland and is organised by HDB's Community Relations Group.
The first event - an exhibition called Heartland Youthoria - was launched yesterday by Minister of State for National Development and Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin.
The exhibition in Toa Payoh Central includes information panels on ongoing community events, as well as games.
Student Heartland Ambassadors were present to give members of the public tips on how to help save the environment, and encourage them to cultivate closer bonds with their neighbours.
Some events that can be expected in the coming week include a student race across five HDB towns, and the distribution of "shine" cards for residents to record kind acts by their neighbours.
All these events will revolve around the theme of "L.I.F.E", which stands for "Let's be considerate neighbours", "It's my town", "Friends next door" and "Eco@home".
Mr Tan said: "Through this week's line-up of community events, we hope to inspire, and raise young people's awareness on community bonding and to celebrate life in the heartland."
The Community Relations Group, which was formed in 2009, has also stepped up efforts to get more residents involved in community events by engaging them in pre-event engagement activities, such as photography contests.
Ms Nurdiyanah Kamsan, 27, an executive community-relations manager at HDB, said the contests have proven effective, boosting participation rates among residents by 5 per cent since the start of the year.
