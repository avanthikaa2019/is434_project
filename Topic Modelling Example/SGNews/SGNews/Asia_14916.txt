A drug storage official at Central Memorial Hospital has been arrested on charges of stealing 5,000 pseudoephedrine tablets and forging purchase orders for 370,000 tablets.
Police told a press conference yesterday that their investigation found that from May-September of last year, Phitsinee Prasertsri (Thidaporn Khampopk), 32, had reportedly taken the cold and sinus tablets containing pseudoephedrine on various occasions out of the hospital for resale.

The hospital also had its representative file a complaint at the Muang Chiang Mai Police Station.

When the medicine was delivered, she allegedly smuggled them out to resell them.
Police were gathering evidence for arrest warrants for two or three people at the drug companies who were involved in this crime.

Waranya Lertworakitpipat, the hospital director, said the hospital usually uses 500 such tablets a year and orders only a small amount each time.
