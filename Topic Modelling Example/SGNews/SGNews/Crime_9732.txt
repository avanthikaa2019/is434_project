KUALA LUMPUR - Police in Kuala Lumpur and in Penang nabbed a total of 35 guest relations officers (GROs) who provided sex services after getting into the country on student visas.
Those arrested in an entertainment outlet in Jalan Bukit Bintang were from Uzbekistan (15), Tajikistan (15), Kyrgyzstan (one) and Thailand (two) while two Nigerians were arrested at a hotel in Jalan Pintal Tali in George Town.
Bukit Aman's anti-vice, gambling and secret societies division (D7) raided the Bukit Bintang outlet at about 1.30am yesterday.
Those arrested produced their student passes when caught by police.
The women, aged between 23 and 36, claimed to be studying at different colleges in the city.
D7 division chief assistant director Datuk Abdul Jalil Hassan said a check with the colleges showed the women never attended classes although they were enrolled there.
He said they only registered to obtain their student cards as a cover for their activities.
"Investigations revealed the women charged RM500 (S$200) for services provided," he said.
Their customers were mostly foreigners. The women have been remanded.
Penang Immigration Department enforcement chief Abdul Rahman Hassan said the Nigerians, both aged 26, were holding valid student visas.
"They are believed to have been involved in the activity since a month ago. Based on the information on their visas, they studied at a college in Puchong, Selangor," he said.
He said nine immigration officers took part in the operation.
He said his men moved in when the women brought their customers to their rooms in a hotel nearby, adding that condoms, lubricants and tissue papers were found in their bags.
