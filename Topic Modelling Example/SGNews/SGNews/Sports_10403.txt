KHARKIV, Ukraine - The Jalur Gemilang was among the thousands of flags being waved at the Euro 2012 Group B match between Holland and Germany at the Metalist stadium here on Wednesday night.
The flag was proudly displayed by a small group of Malaysian football fans whose trip to Kharkiv was made possible by Naza Kia Malaysia, which has organised various competitions over the past few months offering trips to watch Euro 2012 matches as top prizes.
Among the group of 12 winners was Azlan Awalludin, 18, who was all smiles after the match as the team he was rooting for won.
"I am glad that Germany won," said Azlan, a Petronas Technology University student, who went along with his elder brother to test drive a Kia and ended up being one of the winners.
For fellow football fan Muhammad Safuan Alias, however, the evening did not turn out as he had hoped.
A keen Holland supporter, he had dressed for the match in Dutch kit, down to his orange socks.
"When I heard that I had won the trip, I prepared my gear immediately," he said, displaying his orange jersey which had his name on the back.
Pre-match, he had been all smiles but his disappointment was evident as he walked out of the stadium.
However, Muhammad Safuan, 22, a student at the KL Metropolitan University College, was still glad to be at the match.
"I had to apply for permission to take part in this trip," he said, adding that he won the "trip of a lifetime" after test driving a Kia Sportage with his sister.
