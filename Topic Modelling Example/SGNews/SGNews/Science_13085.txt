JAPAN - Mt. Fuji may be sitting on a 30-kilometer active fault capable of generating a magnitude-7 earthquake, which could trigger huge landslides on the mountain, according to a Japanese researcher.
If the fault shifts, it could trigger a "sector collapse" on Mt. Fuji, said Prof. Hiroshi Sato, an expert on structural geology at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo. Sato will report the study results at the Japan Geoscience Union Meeting scheduled to start May 20 in Chiba.
The active fault is beneath the eastern base of Mt. Fuji near Gotemba, Shizuoka Prefecture. It is thought to be a boundary where the Philippine Sea plate, which lies below the Izu Peninsula, collides with the overriding plate from the south. The active fault connects to the western side of the Kannawa/Kozu-Matsuda fault zone, an area that was previously confirmed, according to Sato.
As a result of research on an underground structure that simulates ground shaking, the active fault is believed to be about 30 kilometers long from northeast to southwest. It is classified as a reverse fault, which occurs when two rock formations are forced together by compression. The fault becomes deeper as it extends toward Mt. Fuji's summit, and is believed to be 10 to 20 kilometers deep directly under the mountain's summit.
The active fault is thought to have moved within the past 1 million years, but the exact timing and movement cycles are unknown.
When a sector collapse occurred at a peak that existed on the eastern slope of Mt. Fuji about 2,900 years ago, it caused an avalanche, launching rocks about 15 kilometers down the mountain and covering an area of current Gotemba and its vicinity.
Sato said his team needs to investigate when seismic activity took place at the fault through boring.
