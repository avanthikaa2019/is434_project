LOS ANGELES - Exercising their NBA contract option, the Los Angeles Clippers retained Vinny Del Nigro as coach for the 2012-2013 season, the club announced on Tuesday.
No terms of the deal were announced, but the move had been expected after the Clippers, long-time losers, went 40-26 in a season shortened by a 2011 money dispute between players and club owners.
The Clippers finished just behind the Los Angeles Lakers in the Pacific division in the regular season but eliminated Memphis in the first round before being swept out of the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round.
Del Negro, 45, went 32-50 in the previous season. He has also spent two years as coach of the Chicago Bulls and compiled a career NBA coaching record of 154-158 over four years. He played 14 NBA seasons from 1988 through 2002.
