Yesterday 41 persons were confirmed as infected with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) at Nakhon Ratchasima Rajanagarindra Psychiatric Hospital in the Northeast.
Six have been allowed to return home while the rest are under quarantine at the hospital to prevent the spread of the disease, and are not allowed any family visits.
Kamron Chaisiri, inspector-general of the Public Health Ministry, said the hospital found the first case on June 12 in the ward for alcoholics, who have weaker immune systems and are easily infected.
Six women and 35 men have been admitted, including six hospital staff. The patients are on the antiviral drug Tamiflu and none are severely ill. They have been separated for better treatment.
New patients will not be admitted until the situation is confirmed as safe, which would take about two weeks, but outpatient services are operating as usual. Health officials have surveyed schools in the province and discovered no other flu cases, he added.
