That it features Soundgarden's first new song in 15 years, Live To Rise, is the best reason to dig the soundtrack of this box-office smash.
Beyond that, the track listing reads like a passe concert bill, with bands like Papa Roach (Even If I Could) and Buckcherry (Where I Go) featuring.
Still, don't miss Kasabian's contribution, the slinky Pistols At Dawn, which simply rocks.
OST Avengers Assemble (Universal) 3/5 stars
