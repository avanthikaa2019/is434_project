Armed with Tong's IC, she went to the club on March 23 at about 11pm with her boyfriend Eng Ting Fong, 20, a full-time national serviceman, reported The Straits Times.
However, when they tried to enter Powerhouse two hours later, they were found out when security officer Muhammad Iimi Hussain, 24, asked for identification and noticed that the picture on the IC was not her. He also found her ez-link card on Eng. She had told him to keep it in case her belongings were searched, said the paper.
Liu will be back in court on July 12 for sentencing, while the cases against Eng, Hong and Tong for abetting in the offence have not been heard yet.
