With Shrek The Musical arriving here next month from the United States, local theatre-goers will get to experience up close the hilarious yet heartwarming tale of the grou&shy;&shy;chy green ogre Shrek and the spunky princess Fiona.
Currently playing in London, the show garnered rave reviews in both Broadway and the West End for its ability to wow adults and children alike with its unique blend of humour, music and visual pizzazz.
The musical even bagged a Tony Award for Best Costume Design in 2008.
