KUALA LUMPUR - The boyfriend who is believed to have set his girlfriend on fire after a heated lovers' quarrel has been remanded.
The woman, 22, is still in critical condition after suffering burns to 90 per cent of her body.
Cheras OCPD Asst Comm Mohan Singh said the 33-year-old stall owner was being investigated for attempted murder under Section 307 of the Penal Code and remanded for seven days pending investigations.
"He is still undergoing treatment for the burns he suffered to his hands and arms at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Hospital," he said.
ACP Mohan Singh said a statement had been recorded from the man, family members as well as neighbours at their Taman Segar, Cheras, house.
ACP Mohan said that investigations revealed that the two had been living together for the past two years.
Neighbours were awakened by a loud commotion from the suspect's flat at 2.30am on Friday.
Firemen who rushed to the scene found the woman lying motionless.
A neighbour said the two were often heard quarrelling but this was the first time that the matter had escalated to such an extent.
