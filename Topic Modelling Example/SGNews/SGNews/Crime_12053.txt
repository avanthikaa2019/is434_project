SINGAPORE - A 40-year-old woman suffered first degree burns to more than 80 per cent of her body, after her former lover allegedly set her on fire.
According to a Shin Min Daily News report, the incident happened at 8.30am this morning in Sengkang.
The woman, Ms Xiong Meiling, was staying with her aunt's family at Compassvale Blk 206B, after moving out of her lover's home after a fight.
Neighbours reported seeing the man, believed to be in his 40s, outside the family's flat on the 14th floor.
The Chinese news daily reported that he was splashing kerosene on the door.
Hearing a commotion, a male occupant in his thirties, believed to be Ms Xiong's younger cousin, opened the door. The man immediately rushed in to the flat.
One neighbour, cab-driver Mr Guo, 47, reported seeing a badly-burnt Ms Xiong emerging from the flat wrapped in a towel.
According to the victim's uncle, Mr Pan, 60, his niece had been together with the man for three years and were living together before they broke up.
Her parents are currently living in Taiwan and have not been informed of their daughter's condition.
The suspect and Mr Pan's son were also injured. Both suffered second degree burns to their limbs.
Ms Xiong is currently in critical condition at Singapore General Hospital with burns to 86 per cent of her body.
According to the Shin Min Daily News, Minister of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, Mr Teo Ser Luck, had arrived on the scene to lend a helping hand.
Mr Teo drove Mr Pan and his wife to visit their son in hospital, and thanked neighbours for their help in putting out the flames.
