GOMBAK, Malaysia - While their employers were away on a weekend business trip, two Indonesian maids made off with valuables worth about RM500,000 (S$205,450).
The two emptied their employers' jewellery boxes containing designer watches, diamond rings and earrings as well as designer clothing and stacks of cash.
"They even took their passports with them," said Datin Ira Ghani, a 35-year-old businesswoman, at her home here.
She said she received a voicemail on Sunday from her son, saying that the maids were not at home.
The 13-year-old boy told her that his eight-year-old brother's and his iPads and iPhones were missing.
When Ira and her husband returned on Monday, they were dismayed to discover that their valuables were missing even though they had been kept under lock and key.
"My room door as well as the drawers where I keep my jewellery were still locked. They must have found the spare keys which my husband keeps at home," she said.
Her sons told her that the maids had ordered them to go straight to bed after they came home from a day out with their cousin on Saturday.
"I suspect that is when they ran away. Luckily, they locked up the house before they sneaked out. Imagine if the doors were unlocked while my children slept upstairs," she added.
Ira later found a set of keys in the refrigerator and the automatic gate remote control in the mailbox. The maids had also thrown away their old clothes.
Her husband Datuk Dr Ibrahim Ahmad lodged a report at the Gombak police station the same day and had notified the Immigration Department to cancel the maids' work permits.
Ira said she had not expected the maids to run away after working for over a year.
"We treated them well and they had been very honest employees. They even said they wanted to continue working for us," she said.
Dr Ibrahim said this was an expensive lesson for not being more careful with their valuables.
"Employers cannot trust their maids completely," he said.
