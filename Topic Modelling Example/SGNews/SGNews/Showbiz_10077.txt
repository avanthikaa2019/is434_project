BANGKOK - Thailand's Culture Ministry on Monday demanded an explanation from the producer of a talent show which broadcast a female contestant painting with her bare breasts on national television.
"Society has criticised this show and we need to seek an answer," Culture Minister Sukumol Kunplome told AFP.
The contestant on the Sunday show of "Thailand's Got Talent" removed her shirt and bra before pouring tins of coloured paint on her breasts, which she rubbed on the canvas as the judges watched open-mouthed and the audience cheered.
She was voted through to the next round by two male judges, to the dismay of the sole female judge. The show's producer was not available to comment.
Despite Thailand's flourishing sex industry, officials in the kingdom often criticise raunchy activities in public.
Last week the Culture Ministry said it had filed a complaint to police against US pop diva Lady Gaga for using the Thai flag during her show last month while wearing a skimpy outfit.
