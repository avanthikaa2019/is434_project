BEIJING - Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin on Tuesday reiterated hopes that the Syrian government and opposition groups would immediately adhere to a UN-brokered ceasefire.
Syrian troops shelled villages, fired across frontiers and were accused of massacres in the hours before a deadline on Tuesday that many doubt halt a 13-month slide into all-out civil war.
International mediator, and former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan has put forward a six-point peace plan for ending the year-long fighting that lays down a deadline for Syria to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns on Tuesday, followed by a ceasefire by both Syrian forces and opposition fighters 48 hours later on April 12.
