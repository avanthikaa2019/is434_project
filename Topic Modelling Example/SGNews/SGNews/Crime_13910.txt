EAST JAVA - A woman carrying 60 ecstasy pills in her underwear was foiled in her attempt to smuggle the drugs into a prison in Situbondo, East Java.
Sumyati, 30, was allegedly trying to smuggle the illegal drugs for a friend who was incarcerated in Situbondo Prison. She had previously made five successful drug runs into the prison.
Prison officials said that Sumyati was acting suspiciously during her prison visit, adding that she always tried to avoid contact with officials and would always refuse whenever police wanted to search her for contraband.
Officials finally examined her after she tried to hide in a bathroom. Due to their discovery, officials say that they have increased prison security.
"We have tightened surveillance, both of visitors and inmates," said Andri Setyawan, a Situbondo Prison security official, on Tuesday, as quoted by kompas.com.
Sumyati will be charged with violating Article 98 of Law No. 36/2009 on health, and could face up to ten years in prison.
