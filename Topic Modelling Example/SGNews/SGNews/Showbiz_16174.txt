HONG KONG - Hypnotherapist Dick Yu has a mission that seems unthinkable to some Hong Kong people: He wants to make the Asian financial hub's seven million residents laugh.
"Hong Kong people don't laugh because they are under constant pressure to make more money, to make life better," said Mr Yu, who founded 11 Laughter Clubs in 2007.
"People get worried easily because housing is so expensive, the cost of living is getting higher and people are concerned about whether they can keep their job."
The 35-year-old hypnotherapist set up Hong Kong's first laughter club after he discovered laughter yoga, made popular as an exercise routine by Indian physician Madan Kataria in 1995.
Since then, hundreds of Hong Kongers have signed up for the free classes, a sign, experts say, of the city's un- derlying health and social problems.
"When you laugh, you're happier; you become positive and everything else will become better," Mr Yu said after a one-hour laughing session in a park.
"Ho ho, ha ha ha," the group of 30 students recite.
They combine the exercise with deep yogic breathing, give each other high-fives, and waddle like penguins, all in the name of laughter.
The fake laughter turns into the real thing, demonstrating that laughter has physiological benefits, whether it is fake or real.
A British study last year showed that 15 minutes of laughter increased the level of pain tolerance by around 10 per cent, as the action helps to trigger the release of endorphins, the body's naturally produced pain- killers.
Social scientists say the laughter-club boom highlights the stress faced by many residents of densely populated Hong Kong, which groans under extremes of inequality, soaring property prices and cramped living spaces.
