China has been subject to an increasing number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation cases launched by Western and developing countries, with most cases involving machinery and electrical products, the Ministry of Commerce said.
In the first quarter of this year, China received 17 cases of anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures, compared with nine cases a year earlier, according to figures from the commerce ministry.
These cases involved a total value of $2.62 billion (S$3.34 billion), up 106 per cent year-on-year, the figure showed.
Within the hi-tech industry, frictions occurred most often in the telecommunications and alternative energy areas.
The US and European Union launched the most inquiries. Probes launched by developing countries including Brazil and Mexico are on the rise.
