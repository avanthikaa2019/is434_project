A woman in Quangzhou, China, was reported to have been tied to an electricity pole after she was caught stealing two loaves of bread last Saturday.
A placard which read "I am a thief" was slung across her body.
The bakery shop owner claimed that she had stolen from his shop several times.
However, some Netizens criticised the owner, saying he should not have humiliated the woman in such a way.
