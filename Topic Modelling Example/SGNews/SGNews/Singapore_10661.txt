A CHINESE national died Monday night after reportedly jumping into a swimming pool following a drinking session with friends.
The construction worker had been drinking with about five or six others at a Kovan coffeeshop before heading back to Goodrich Park, an old condominium where they were staying.
The Straits Times said the group decided to go for a swim and then shower at the pool facilities as they shared three toilets between 10 people.
The worker, aged about 40 and who apparently could not swim, then jumped into the pool.
He began struggling and was pulled from the water. A friend said a neighbour quickly jumped in to help pull him out.
He was apparently still breathing when he emerged from the water.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said they received a call at about 10.35pm and sent an ambulance to the scene.
The worker was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
The friend told the English daily that the worker had been in Singapore for more than a year and had just moved into Goodrich Park condominium on the afternoon before he died.
Most of the people living in the condominium are foreign workers; companies are known to rent flats as dormitories for their employees.
The condominium is understood to be quite run-down and could be demolished by the end of the month, evening daily Lianhe Wanbao said.
