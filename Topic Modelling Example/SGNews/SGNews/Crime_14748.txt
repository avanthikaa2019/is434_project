Police are calling on victims to look at evidence and identify the suspects at Makkasan police station.
The seven suspects - namely Pathaithip Jaroram, 47, and Vietnamese nationals aged between 16 and 29 - were presented at a press conference yesterday.
Pathaithip is believed to have been the gang leader, providing other members of the gang housing and taking them to crowded places where they could cut handbags and pick pockets. She is also believed to have sold the stolen items.
Police said Pathaithip had previously been arrested for four other offences and bribery. Initial investigation has found that the gang was involved in 30 theft cases in the Makkasan area, 42 in the Lumpini area and 29 in the Lat Phrao area.
