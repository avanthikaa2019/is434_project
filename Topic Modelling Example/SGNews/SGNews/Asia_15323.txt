BANDA ACEH, Indonesia - Indonesian authorities on Thursday were hunting for 32 prisoners who were released temporarily during a tsunami alert triggered by a massive quake, a local police chief said.
Dumadi, police chief of Pidie district in Aceh province, said 63 prisoners left through an open gate after Wednesday's massive 8.6-magnitude quake that triggered a tsunami warning across the Indian Ocean, but that not all had returned.
&ldquo;We are still searching for 32 prisoners who haven't returned since last night,&rdquo; said Dumadi, who goes by one name.
Guards left the prison gate open during the alert to allow prisoners to try to save their lives if a tsunami struck, he said.
Fears of a tsunami run high in Aceh, which was virtually flattened during a 2004 tsunami that killed 170,000 people in the province.
Wednesday's quake did not result in a sizeable tsunami and inflicted only minor damage.
