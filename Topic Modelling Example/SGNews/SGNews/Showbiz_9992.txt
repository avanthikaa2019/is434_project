US actor Zac Efron and British-American actress Lily Collins have reportedly called it quits after a three-month fling.
A source told Us Weekly magazine: "They're no longer together. They were never serious, though; it was just a casual thing and it fizzled. They were never in the same place at the same time."
But others are saying Efron, 24, and Collins, 23, weren't even an official item to begin with.
An insider told E! News: "They became friends after being introduced by mutual pals. But the chemistry wasn't there. I can't even remember the last time they saw one another...it's been such a long time. So it never ended, because it never really started."
