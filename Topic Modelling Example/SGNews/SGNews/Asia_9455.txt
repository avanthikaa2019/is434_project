The plucky seven-year-old girl tried to shield her mother from being attacked by a mentally-ill man wielding a steel shovel.
But little Wang Yan, from a village in Anhui province, China, was hit and is now being treated in hospital for a serious brain injury.
The girl suffered a broken skull and injury to her brain stem.
Her mother died at the scene of the attack, which happened in April, reported the Shanghai Daily.
Doctors told the family that Wang Yan would not emerge from her coma and said it would be pointless to spend money on her treatment.
But her father and brother decided to sell everything they had to take her to Shanghai for treatment.
The family said they were able to bring only 8,000 yuan (S$1,600) there as they were almost broke from paying for the father's cancer treatment.
Wang Yan was admitted to Shanghai Blue Cross Brain Hospital in early June after her brother contacted the hospital.
Dr Pan Renlong, director of the hospital's neurosurgery department, told Shanghai Daily last Friday it is not impossible for the girl to survive the injury, but that she may need one to two years of rehabilitation.
He said: "She was in deep coma when she arrived at our hospital... (But she can now) open her eyes from time to time. But the movements are unconscious, which means that she is still under a shallow coma."
When Wang Yan arrived at the hospital in Shanghai, Dr Pan operated on her to drain fluid from her brain.
The next treatment, he said, is to awaken the girl.
Doctors now hope that the little girl can live on her own after long-term treatment.
Said Dr Pan: "I am not sure whether she can recover so well, but I will try my best."
He added: "I was deeply moved by the little girl's behaviour. How brave is a girl who would reach out to shield her mother from a crazy adult at such a time."
