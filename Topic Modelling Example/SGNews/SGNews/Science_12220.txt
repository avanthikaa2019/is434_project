CHILDREN soak up more electromagnetic waves in certain frequencies than adults, a recent study suggested.
According to the research results published on Monday, more electromagnetic waves are taken in by children in and around the frequency band of 1000 MHz - which is used in FM broadcasting - and 1 GHz, the frequency band of mobile telecommunication.
Also, children who use cellphones are often more likely to develop Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the study said.
The study was conducted by researchers from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Korea Communications Commission and the Korean Institute of Electromagnetic Engineering and Science.
The research team was the first to review the biological effects of electromagnetic waves in multi-frequencies such as CDMA and WCDMA, and revealed that there were no signs of cellular ageing or division, protein expression and active oxygen formation that suggested harmful effects.
Said Mr Choi Hyung Do, who led the research team: "There were no definite results pointing to the harmful effects that electromagnetic waves have on human beings, but it is too early to say that they are completely safe."
The team, however, noted that more research was needed in order to determine whether the direct cause of the phenomenon was due to electromagnetic-wave exposure.
The findings come after other nations' studies. A 2010 Denmark study said that children who were exposed to cellphones, before birth and to the age of seven, were 50 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems.
