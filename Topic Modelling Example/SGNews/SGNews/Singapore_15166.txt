Students in the National Cadet Corps will now get to wear the new pixelised uniforms, joining men and women in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) who are already wearing them.
Minister of State for Defence and Education Lawrence Wong launched the new uniforms at the 12th NCC affirmation ceremony held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Saturday.
At the event, Mr Wong said that NCC has embarked on a five-year "Transformation Master Plan" to better cater to the aspirations of its cadets and to stay relevant.
It presently "provides a wide range of opportunities and unique experiences for our students to build character, develop leadership and lifeskills and most importantly, build and deepen their commitment to our nation," he added.
Cadets are given opportunities to participate in experiential camps with units like the Officer Cadet School and the Singapore Combat Engineers to familiarise themselves with training and operational activities.
They can also experience SAF overseas training through attachments to exercises such as Exercise Panzer Strike, Exercise Thunder Warrior and Exercise Wallaby.
The ceremony is a biennial event to officially welcome newly recruited Secondary One cadets (Junior Cadets) into the NCC family. More than 4000 NCC members comprising teacher officers, cadet officers, cadets and associate members attended the ceremony.
The new uniforms have already been issued to all junior cadets from the land units.
