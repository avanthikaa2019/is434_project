Retiree Yow Yin Ngan, 85, can sleep tight now, without worrying about bedbugs.
That is, after her one-room flat in Bandar Street received a spring cleaning yesterday under the Hands for Homes community programme.
Her household was among 10 one- and two-room rental flats in Kreta Ayer belonging to the elderly which were cleaned by volunteers and fumigated by a pest-control company.
Where needed, residents also received new mattresses, bedframes and furniture.
Madam Yow told reporters in Cantonese: "I'm very grateful for what the volunteers have done for me."
Launched last month, Hands for Homes is a pilot initiative by the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC).
It was spearheaded by Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Member of Parliament Lily Neo, who initially started a programme called Stop Pest in her Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng ward last September.
The Central Singapore CDC has raised up to $200,000 for the programme's first year.
The three-year initiative is expected to cost $1 million, with some 2,000 households standing to benefit annually.
It has been rolled out in Tanjong Pagar GRC, which is home to some 24,000 one- and two-room rental flats, with plans to extend it to other GRCs in the Central Singapore district.
In that district, one in three residents is aged 50 and above.
Hands for Homes also seeks to improve the well-being of elderly residents, through the distribution of induction cookers and anti-slip mats, and the installation of energy-efficient lightbulbs.
Said Dr Neo: "Bedbug bites are longer-lasting and itchier than mosquito bites... The rash causes irritation and sleepless nights for the elderly."
Central Singapore district mayor Sam Tan, who was also present yesterday, called Dr Neo a "warrior of a new kind - a BB or bedbugs warrior".
