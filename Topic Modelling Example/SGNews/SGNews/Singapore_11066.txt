SINGAPORE - Into his second week as Hougang's new Member of Parliament (MP), Workers' Party (WP) member Png Eng Huat has formed a new grassroots committee.
The old committee was suspended after former Hougang MP Yaw Shin Leong was expelled in February, The Straits Times (ST) reported.
Headed by Mr Png, the new team is made up of 17 members, with a mix of old and new faces, he announced at his second Meet-the-People-Session.
WP's organising secretary Ng Swee Bee, 31 has been appointed as Mr Png's deputy and tutor Janice Ng, 32, is now the committee's secretary and treasurer.
Mr Png told reporters that they have a number of activities planned from now to the end of the year. For example, he and his team are preparing two tours to Malaysia for residents and plan to organise regular football matches for youths in Hougang.
Mr Png is also requesting for feedback from residents on bus services in the area. This is for the purpose of requesting for improvements on behalf of the two WP constituencies in the ongoing government review.
Carrying out their promise to work with the ruling party, the six MPs also plan to contact the People's Association grassroots organisations in their wards for their feedback.
During the Meet-the-People-Session, Mr Png told reporters that he would be spending the bulk of his time on Hougang MP duties, but would like to take on work projects of his own occasionally.
WP chief Low Thia Khiang, who was present at the session, said that he would still return to Hougang once in a while to 'walk and see'.
