KUALA LUMPUR - Asean must realise that acts of terrorism are borderless and terror networks cover several countries, Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said.
He said the grouping also faced a host of issues that posed imminent threats to the region's security and harm the economic and social well-being of its people.
Muhyiddin said to cope with the threats of terrorism, Asean member states needed to strengthen cooperation among themselves besides sharing technical expertise and information.
"Regional forum on security and defence serves as an important mechanism to enhance the collective capability of Asean member states and dialogue partners to swiftly and effectively respond to those threats," he said at the closing ceremony of the Putrajaya Forum here yesterday.
The forum on security was held in conjunction with the Defence Services Asia (DSA) 2012 exhibition and conference.
Muhyiddin said Asean's efforts in community building were a result of significant changes taking root in the region the past two decades.
"The end of the Cold War, the advance of globalisation and the increasing influence of China and India as emerging political and economic powerhouses have forced Asean to shift from its original preventive diplomacy of maintaining peace and harmony to the constructive diplomacy of community building," he added.
