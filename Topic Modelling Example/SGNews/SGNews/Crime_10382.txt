SIBU, Malaysia - A 31-year-old bank manager was stabbed to death in his home at Lane 33A, Jalan Ulu Sungai Merah.
Wong King Kui of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) was killed after coming home from a dinner with clients in town.
When he arrived home Wong went to the upper floor of his terraced house as he wanted to sleep while his wife remained downstairs.
Minutes later the wife heard a commotion coming from the bedroom and upon checking saw a dark figure escaping through the window.
She found Wong lying on the floor bleeding profusely and screaming for help.
She immediately called family members who rushed over around 1.30am.
An ambulance reached the house at 1.45am, but by then Wong was already dead due to a deep wound in the back of his neck and another on his back.
His body was later sent to Sibu Hospital mortuary for a post mortem.
It was believed that an intruder armed with a knife had entered the house through the back door.
But police investigations revealed that there was no sign of a break-in.
The suspect was believed to have made his escape by climbing over the brick wall behind the house.
No weapon was found at the scene of the crime.
Police have classified the case as murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code.
Wong joined HSBC in 2007. He was appointed branch manager a year ago.
A source from the bank said he was a very capable man.
"He was also a very friendly person and boss," the source said.
