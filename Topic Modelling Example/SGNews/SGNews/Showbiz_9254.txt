The force of nature that is Beth Ditto, plus-sized frontwoman of this American glam-punk trio, has always set herself apart by being as edgy as possible.
Yet, on the outfit's fifth record - which was helmed by Girls Aloud producer Brian Higgins - she sounds puzzingly restrained.
Though her voice still impresses, a lot of the character and authenticity that she and her compadres are known for seem to have been polished right out of retro-sounding pop songs like Involved and Get A Job.
