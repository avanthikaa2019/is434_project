It is too premature for former Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) director Ng Boon Gay to decide if he will claim trial against the corruption charges he faces, his lawyers said in court yesterday.
This is because the particulars of the case were not yet available.
On June 12, Ng's lawyers said that he would claim trial against his charges.
Ng was charged with four counts of corruption where he is said to have obtained sexual gratification from a woman.
His lawyers and the prosecution will discuss details of the case again in three weeks' time in a pre-trial conference.
