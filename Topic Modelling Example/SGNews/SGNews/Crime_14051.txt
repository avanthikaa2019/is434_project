He was dubbed the "eBay millionaire" after he claimed he had made a fortune buying and selling items online.
Benjamin Marc Wee Tshung Mun also used to conduct workshops and, in 2009, even appeared on a Channel News Asia talk show in a segment on successful Internet entrepreneurs.
Wee, 40,who used to run an Internet commerce company known as WTF, was jailed five months yesterday after pleading guilty to one count of cheating last month.
An additional charge of criminal breach of trust involving $8,500 was tendered against Wee on Thursday.
He was accused of misappropriating the money entrusted to him by a man known as Wandy, between May and July 2009.
This charge was taken into consideration during sentencing.
Wee, who turned up in court in a black and white pullover with faded blue jeans, looked calm as he stood in the dock.
He told district judge Soh Tze Bian he was prepared to accept his sentence and would be "very happy with anything (the court) decides".
Wee had admitted that he cheated a manager on April 1, 2009.
The victim, who is in his 40s, had given $25,000 to Wee after the latter promised him that the money would be used to buy Secure Digital (SD) memory cards from China.
Wee also claimed that the cards would then be sold at a high profit online.
The victim filed a police report against Wee on Aug 4, 2010.
The court heard that Wee has not made any restitution to his victim.
For cheating, Wee could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined.
The victim, speaking to The New Paper outside the courtroom, said he was pleased with the sentence Wee received.
