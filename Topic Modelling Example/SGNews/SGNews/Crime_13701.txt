SINGAPORE - A second man involved in the gang-related killing of 19-year-old Darren Ng Wei Jie at Downtown East has been sentenced.
Puay De Feng, 21, who was a secret society member, was sentenced to five years and six strokes of the cane.
He pleaded guilty to rioting at Pasir Ris Close and voluntarily causing hurt to a Korean national at St James Power Station, reported The Straits Times.
The victim, Ng, was a member of a rival gang. He was slashed and stabbed by one or more members in Puay's group at the main foyer of the Pasir Ris Close shopping mall on Oct 30, 2010.
Investigations revealed that the incident arose due to bad blood between a member of Puay's gang, Stilwell Ong Keat Pin, 20, and Dickson Ng Teck Seng, 20, who was in Darren Ng's gang.
Jason Chew Wei Beng, 21, was the first to be convicted of the crime. He was convicted of rioting and sentenced to four years jail and six strokes of the cane.
