ATHENS - Early elections in Greece are "most likely" to be held on May 6, a finance ministry official said on Monday.
"The most likely date" is May 6, the official said, requesting anonymity.
The government has declined to give a planned election date as parliament is due to vote by April 10 on legislation tied to Greece's obligations under an EU-IMF economic rescue in May 2010, and a follow-up eurozone bailout agreed in February.
Parliament could be dissolved on April 11, the official added.
Legislative elections in Greece are traditionally held on a Sunday.
Under the constitution, ballots must be set within 30 days after parliament is dissolved.
Government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis on Monday said the relevant announcement would be made by next week.
"Perhaps not this week, but next week," he told private Skai television.
"A certain procedure needs to be followed, the date cannot be announced before the president is informed," Kapsis said, referring to the Greek head of state.
Legislative elections were originally scheduled to be held next year, but former prime minister George Papandreou stepped down in November to make way for a power-sharing coalition government under Lucas Papademos to ratify the latest rescue.
