The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) is now opening the land formerly occupied by the former Bukit Timah Railway Station (BTRS) and Tanjong Pagar Railway Station (TPRS) to the public to hold community events, sports activities and exhibitions.
Ad-hoc activities and events can be held by individuals and organisations, subject to SLA's terms and conditions. SLA says it is wishes to inject vibrancy and life to the two buildings and the surrounding area.
Removal works along the former railway land were completed at the end of 2011. The land has been levelled and turfed.
The first event to be held at TPRS is the Female and Nuyou Magazines' joint fashion event &ldquo;Female Nuyou Catwalk 2012&rdquo; on 25 April with 400 invited guests.
Ms Diana Lee, General Manager, Fashion &amp; Beauty, SPH Magazines said: "We chose the former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station as an event site because of its unique heritage. We are pleased to be given the opportunity to hold the very first event here. TPRS has a wonderful ambience where we can see the blending of the new (fashion) and the old (heritage)."
In January 2012, SLA identified three sites along the Rail Corridor and adjacent vacant state land for interim community use. These are located near Jalan Hang Jebat, Ghim Moh Road and Kampong Bahru Flyover.
Currently, improvement works are being carried out at these sites, which have been cordoned off for safety reasons, and will be progressively opened from April 2012.
The public will be able to enjoy free access to these sites for recreational activities until such time when the land is required for development.
Meanwhile, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is undertaking a comprehensive review of development plans for the former railway stations, railway land and their surrounding areas. It will study the proposal to maintain a continuous green link along the Rail Corridor while balancing the need for development.
