A youth who stabbed a Raffles Institution boy last year was sentenced on Monday to two years' split probation - part of the sentence is to be served at home and the rest in a boys' home.
The 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named because he is a minor, was part of the unlawful assembly which hurt Anand Ravindran, then 17.
After assaulting Anand with four others, he stabbed Anand in the back.
On Friday, three more members of the assembly - Lim Ming Yi, Terence Chue Wei Teck and Liong Hong Ting, all 18 - pleaded guilty to one charge of rioting each.
Lim and Liong are now in remand, pending probation and Reformative Training Centre (RTC) reports.
Chue's case has been adjourned to June 26.
On December 1, Lim, Chue and Isaac Ang Shi Ming, 17, challenged Anand and a friend, Don Tan, to a fight after an alleged staring incident at Potong Pasir Avenue1.
Lim called the 15-year-old boy, who brought Liong along.
At Block 122, the 15-year-old punched Don and the rest punched and kicked Anand.
The 15-year-old then stabbed Anand with a knife.
He was charged on Dec 3 last year with rioting while armed with a deadly weapon.
On Friday, the Community Court heard that Lim and Liong had been diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, a pattern of disobedience towards authority figures.
Both have spent time at Gracehaven, a Salvation Army-run children's home, and the Singapore Boys' Home.
The court heard that Lim has completed his N levels and will be enrolled in an ITE (East) course in July.
Liong, additionally diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder while in secondary school, is enrolled in ITE (Balestier) and has just completed his examinations.
Both have no gang association and did not know Anand and Don, the court heard.
Ang was placed on two years' probation on April 24.
