Guang Ming Daily reported that the dispute between kung fu stars Vincent Zhao Wenzhuo and Donnie Yen has intensified with the latter's driver being accused of murdering Zhao's driver.
Chinese film director Tan Bing made the accusation earlier, but it was later clarified that the issue was a misunderstanding.
Zhao and Yen, who initially collaborated in a new film Special Identity, turned on each other after a series of disputes erupted before filming began.
This caused Zhao to quit while the movie crew members split into two warring camps.
Tan Bing accused Yen of throwing his weight around by trying to hog scenes and demanding changes to the script.
He also claimed that Yen had stopped Han Geng a former member of K-pop group Super Junior from joining the set.
Yen was apparently worried that the younger and better-looking star would steal the limelight from him.
