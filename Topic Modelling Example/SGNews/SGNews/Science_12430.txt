SINGAPORE - Some M1 customers would have experienced difficulty getting connection on their fibre broadband networks on Sunday.
This was due to a 'technical difficulty on (its) fixed network,' said M1.
The problem was rectified by 3.15pm.
A spokesperson for M1 said the down time last for about one hour before services were restored.
She told The Straits Times that only a 'small number of customers' were affected, and did not give specific numbers.
The cause of the disruption is still under investigation.
The fibre broadband is an ultra-fast network which supports surfing speeds up to 10 times faster than cable broadband services.
M1 has about 29,000 fibre broadband customers, according to the report.
