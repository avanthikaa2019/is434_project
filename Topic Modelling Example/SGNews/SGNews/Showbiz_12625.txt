SHAH ALAM, Malaysia - Popular singer and songwriter Yuna, 26, lost two acoustic guitars and a stereo, worth RM5,000 (S$2,047), when her car was broken into early yesterday morning.
Yuna's guitarist, Farhan Fadzlishah, had earlier borrowed her car and driven it to his home in Subang Jaya.
It was raining heavily and the guitarist heard a loud sound about 6am near his garage. He then went out to check.
He saw two men smashing the car's rear windows while another two men on motorcycles waited outside the gate.
Yuna, whose real name is Yunalis Zarai, shared the incident in her tweets: "Good morning. My car window got smashed today, they took my guitars and a stereo. I hope whoever took it starts a music career.
"To those who smashed my car window, if you feel like doing a good deed, please leave my guitars at the same place. If possible by tonight. I need to use them tomorrow."
Subang Jaya deputy police chief Superintendent Tan Ah Chuan confirmed the incident, saying that a report was lodged yesterday.
