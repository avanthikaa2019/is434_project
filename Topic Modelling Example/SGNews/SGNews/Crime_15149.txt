CHERAS, Malaysia - Three robbers were killed in a shootout with police officers near a roundabout after a car chase here.
The three men were travelling in a car near a hospital at 11.30am yesterday when they saw a police patrol car behind them.
The three panicked and fired a shot at the police car before speeding off.
During the chase, the suspects' car crashed into two cars before they were stopped by the patrolmen near the roundabout.
City CID chief Senior Asst Comm Datuk Ku Chin Wah said one of the suspects, who was in the front seat, fired a shot, forcing the policemen to return fire.
"Two of the suspects, aged 24 and 40, died at the scene, while the other, also aged 24, died on the way to Hospital Kuala Lumpur," he said, adding that police believed the three men had robbed a jewellery shop near Section 18, Shah Alam, on April 6.
He said parang and drugs, believed to be syabu, were found in the car.
"We are trying to trace the jewellery worth RM600,000 (S$245,000)," he said, adding that one of the suspects had previous convictions for drug and robbery-related offences.
SAC Ku also called on the owners of the two cars which the suspects had crashed into to call the police to facilitate investigations.
They can call 03-2115 9999 or contact the nearest police station.
