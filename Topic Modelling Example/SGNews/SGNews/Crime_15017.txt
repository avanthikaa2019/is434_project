SINGAPORE - Police arrested a woman, 34, in Hougang last Friday for her suspected involvement in loan-shark activities.
Initial investigations showed that the suspect had allegedly opened a bank account and given her ATM card and personal-identification number to a loan-shark syndicate to help with an unlicensed moneylending business.
