The typical buyer of private shoebox units is a Singaporean Housing Board flat dweller who is out to snap them up for investment, revealed Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan in Parliament yesterday.
"So, obviously, they don't plan to live there because they won't be able to fit into the 50 sq m," he said.
Currently, there are about 2,500 of these private apartments, which are usually smaller than 50 sq m and located in the Central region.
But Mr Khaw warned that those looking to invest in such units that have also sprung up in heartland areas should exercise caution when venturing into such an "untested market".
He said the Government will monitor this trend and regulate only if necessary.
