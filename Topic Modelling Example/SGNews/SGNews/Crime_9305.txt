A car washer has been sentenced to nine months in jail after he admitted to causing another man to sustain head fractures and a broken cheek bone.
Mohamad Sulaiman Ali, 28, was charged with causing grievous hurt by doing a life-endangering rash act.
The court heard that he had pulled his friend, 50-year-old Mr Chiu Kim Hai, by the shoulder causing him to fall backwards on January 18 this year.
Both Sulaiman and his friend were drug abusers.
He had confronted Chiu at a void deck in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 when he suspected that Chiu was spreading rumours about him peddling drugs.
Mr Chiu, who suffers from schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder, fell unconscious after Sulaiman caused him to fall.
He was hospitalised for close to three months.
Sulaiman could have been jailed for up to four years or fined up to $10,000, or both.
