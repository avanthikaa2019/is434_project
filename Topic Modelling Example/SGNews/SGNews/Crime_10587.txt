SEGAMAT - A 63-year-old businessman was shot dead while fuelling up at a petrol station here.
The victim, identified as Lim Ching Hoon, was shot at least six times by two men on a motorcycle at about 7.45am at the station in Jalan Genuang yesterday.
It is learnt that Lim, who had left home early for a business trip to Kuala Lumpur, was filling his tank when two men on a motorcycle approached him on the pretext of asking for directions.
Sources said the pillion rider then took out a gun and fired several shots at the victim who died on the spot. He was shot in the head, chest and leg.
"The suspects continued to fire at him as he was lying in a pool of blood," the sources said, adding that the suspects were wearing full-face helmets.
It is learnt that robbery has been ruled out as none of the victim's valuables was taken.
OCPD Supt Hanafi Daud appealed to those with information to contact the police at 07-221 2999.
