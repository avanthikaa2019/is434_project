SINGAPORE - A huge fire was spotted by readers at the reclaimed island off north-east Singapore today.
Earlier reports put the location of the fire at Tekong island. However, Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has clarified that the fire was on an island between Singapore and Tekong island.
At 2.06pm, SCDF was alerted to a fire at above mentioned location. With the support of an SAF marine vessel, SCDF dispatched its vehicles and personnel to the location.
One fire engine, one red rhino, one supporting vehicle and two SCDF marine fire vessels were dispatched to the scene.
SCDF arrived on scene about an hour later, at about 3pm. About 10 fire-fighters were fighting the fire with two water jets.
The fire went on for several hours until late in the evening, where the huge blaze was only brought under control at about 4.30pm.
SCDF carried on with their fire-fighting operations on the reclaimed land to put out the remaining bits of fire.
The fire, which was about the size of a football field, had been reduced to small pockets of fire and confined within a sand bunk wall.
SCDF said the contents of the fire was made up of some construction-site machinery and equipment, and products believed to be used in land reclamation.
SCDF marine fire vessels were at the location pumping sea water to assist the fire-fighters on the ground fight the fire.
The fire was finally brought under control at about 6.30pm.
An SCDF spokesperson said that the only people on the island, which is not connected to mainland Singapore, are land reclamation workers.
There were no reported injuries at the time of this report.
The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, and is currently under investigation.
