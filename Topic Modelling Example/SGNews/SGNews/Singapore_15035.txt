AsiaOne readers have a sharp news sense.
When we asked you to find the fake story among a collection of ten outrageous stories to win $100 Takashimaya vouchers, we received hundreds of entries.
Said AsiaOne reader Keith Beh: "Seemingly true riding on the popularity of this app, but I would think this is the fake one!"
Most of you were able to see through the story written by an AsiaOne webknowledgist among the other odd - but real - stories in the lineup. And it wasn't easy. With stories like a robber being 'nailed down' in a chase, a woman who wasted 98 tons of water when she first learned how to flush the toilet, to a man caught with birds down his pants at an airport, it would seem like these are also too incredible to believe.
And based on comments we've received, it was all in good fun.
Another reader, Jean Seow, said: "Thanks for running the contest - I had fun reading all the stories even if I don't win anything."
Quite a few agreed, thanking AsiaOne for organising the contest, saying it was fun.
However, there can only be five winners. To get the winners, we did a random draw from among the correct entries.
Congratulations to Weihong Ling, Lin Kuantai, Chua Eng Hee, Shirley Soh, and Lai Zheng Wei. Winners have been notified by e-mail.
