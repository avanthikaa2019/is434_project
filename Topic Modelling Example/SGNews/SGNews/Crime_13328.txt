MANILA - With only a badminton racket as her weapon, a mother foiled an alleged attempt by two masked men to kidnap her two young children Monday night in Quezon City, police said.
Senior Police Officer 1 Ninez Mendez of the Quezon City Police District said the attempted abduction took place at around 6.30pm near the family's house in San Agustin Village, Barangay Talipapa.
In a statement to the police, the mother said she and her children, aged four and eight years old, were playing badminton in front of their house when a green van stopped near them.
The two assailants emerged and quickly approached the children, said the woman, a housewife married to a construction foreman.
"But she was able to stop them by hitting them with a badminton racket," Mendez said on Tuesday, quoting the woman's account.
The suspects were forced to retreat back to the van "while continuously being beaten with the racket," the officer added.
According to the mother, she saw three other young children inside the van just before the vehicle's door closed.
She failed, however, to get the license plate number.
