Don't want to get into a casino's bad books? Then don't do anything suspicious at a gambling table or you'll be barred from entering a casino.
The Straits Times reported today that a Taiwanese travel writer was banned from the Marina Bay Sands casino last Wednesday for card counting.
Card counting is when different values are assigned to different card types by a player to keep track of cards being played during a blackjack game so that he/she will have an advantage.
MBS told the English daily that 31-year-old Ms Tang Hong An was on its blacklist but did not give any details.
It also said that it reserved the right to exclude individuals from its premises and will not disclose information on its blacklist for privacy and security purposes.
So far, Ms Tang has maintained her innocence and said she is thinking of lodging a complaint as she did not place any bets or touch the cards when she was blacklisted.
Experts said patrons can be turned away for reasons such as cheating, bad behaviour or associating with known gangsters and that it is considered a drastic measure usually used when someone is caught cheating.
A Resorts World Sentosa spokesperson said guests who are barred from entering the casino can appeal, after which the appeal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
There is no fixed period for how long they can be on the list, the spokesperson said.
Both casinos did not say how many people are on their blacklists.
Other experts said effective card counting is no longer possible due to casinos' use of continuous shuffling machines and that other varieties of sleight-of-hand or subterfuge are more common causes for cheats to be blacklisted.
According to The Straits Times, the National Council on Problem Gambling has registered more than 42,000 self-exclusion orders, 909 family exclusion orders and more than 28,000 third-party exclusion orders for undischarged bankrupts and those on public assistance.
