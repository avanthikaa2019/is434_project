A WI-FI dead spot is something many of us have encountered every so often. If only there were Wi-Fi routers with extended reach.
Actually, there are, if we look hard enough and are prepared to experiment, although physical barriers to wireless signals as a rule are hard to surmount.
One such modem is Buffalo's AirStation HighPower, a low- cost but high-performance wireless-N router that claims to increase download speeds six times and extend Wi-Fi range by up to three times, compared to previous models.
A test of this router showed much promise and although no controlled tests were conducted, it does work very well, both in download speed and coverage.
What was also impressive was the ease with which the router could be set up. It uses a Web-based setup wizard and there was no need to use a setup CD. The double 25cm high-gain antennas have much to do with the improved coverage.
The router also works as an extender for any existing router to boost Wi-Fi coverage.
Fifty-nine dollars is not a huge amount to pay for a router that can do much to improve one's Wi-Fi experience.
How much: $59 with three-year warranty for the Buffalo WCR-HP-G300
