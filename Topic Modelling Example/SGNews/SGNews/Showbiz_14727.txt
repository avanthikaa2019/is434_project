Films by two Korean directors will compete for a title at the Cannes Festival, the organizer announced.
The organizer revealed Thursday the full official selection of films that will screen in Cannes from May 16-27, including Im Sang-soo's film "Taste of Money," and Hong Sang-soo's "In Another Country."
Cannes' general delegate Thierry Fremaux selected the 22 films from among some 1,700 submissions from the biggest names in film right down to first-time directors from North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa.
The selected films were by directors such as Americans Wes Anderson and Lee Daniels, as well as French filmmaker Jacque Audiear.
This year's jury is headed by Italian director Nanni Moretti, who scooped a Palme d'Or for "La stanza del figlio" ("The Son's Room") in 2001. The jury for Un Certain Regard is to be chaired by the British actor and director Tim Roth.
Berenice Bejo, leading lady of the hit French silent movie "The Artist", is to host the festival's opening and closing ceremonies.
Wes Anderson's 1960s teen love story "Moonrise Kingdom" will open the festival, while Claude Miller's "Therese Desqueyroux" will close it, in a tribute to the French filmmaker who had barely finished editing the movie when he died this month at age 70.
