A teenager in Busan is in custody and facing a charge of patricide for stabbing his father to death after being scolded, police said Wednesday.
The furious 18-year-old son allegedly followed his father into the bathroom and stabbed him late Tuesday after being told off about a fight he had with a younger sibling, according to the police.
The father, 47, was immediately taken to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery, but died early Wednesday morning, police officials said.
According to the police, the suspect did not get along with his father and was enraged at being scolded for cursing at his younger sibling.
The police said they are currently seeking a formal arrest warrant for the teenager.
