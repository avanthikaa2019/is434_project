Lady Gaga has been playing hide-and-seek with reporters and photographers waiting at her hotel and outside Seoul Olympic Stadium this week, trying to remain unseen in public.
The 26-year-old star arrived in Seoul last Friday but has been avoiding media contact. However, the US pop singer has met fans waiting for her at her hotel lobby on several occasions. The Korea Herald exclusively acquired photographs of Lady Gaga meeting her fans from in and out of the country, while professional photographers failed to snap the star.
At her final rehearsal on Thursday, Lady Gaga went through all the songs to be sung at the "Born This Way Ball" but still expressed anxiety on her Twitter account on Friday morning.
"Nervous for tonight. Hope I make little monsters happy and proud," she wrote.
"This is a very special moment for Haus of Gaga. We thank you so much. Enjoy our music, fashion installations &amp; pop performance art tonight," she added.
