Japan-born comedian Neko Hiroshi, who was chosen to represent Cambodia in the men's marathon at the London Olympics, will not be allowed to run for the nation because of his nationality status, the International Association of Athletics Federations said Tuesday.
Earlier this year, the IAAF implemented a new rule under which an athlete who obtains a new nationality cannot join international competitions until at least one year has passed since the athlete gained the nationality, even if he or she has no experience in international competitions.
The IAAF judged that Neko does not qualify under the new rule, as the 34-year-old changed his nationality to Cambodian just last autumn.
While Cambodia's athletics federation asked the IAAF to give Neko special permission to run for Cambodia in the London Olympics, the world body rejected the request because there was no special reason to give such permission.
Neko, whose real name is Kuniaki Takizaki, was chosen in March to represent the Southeast Asian nation in the men's marathon after he achieved his best time of 2 hours 30 minutes 26 seconds in the Beppu-Oita Mainichi Marathon in February this year.
