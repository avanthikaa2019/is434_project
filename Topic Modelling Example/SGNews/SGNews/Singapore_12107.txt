China Press reported that a recent survey showed that Singaporean men were the happiest on Wednesdays while women were the happiest on Thursdays.
The study was carried out by marketing-cum-communications agency Grey Singapore based on "tweets" by 1,000 random Twitter users aged between 17 and 60.
It also said men were the most depressed on Fridays while women, on Sundays.
Singaporeans aged between 17 and 25 were also found to be the unhappiest.
