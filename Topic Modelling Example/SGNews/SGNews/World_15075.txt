They gathered at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and were joined by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of National Population and Talent Division Teo Chee Hean.
Themed "My Home, My Future", the gathering took the familiar tastes, sights and sounds of Singapore to Singaporeans abroad. There was a line-up of favourite hawker food, home-grown entertainment and showcases on the latest developments here.
Mr Teo spoke about the need for an inclusive and a stronger Singapore. He said that amid Singapore's transformation into a modern and attractive global city, the country "remains our home, and a place for Singaporeans to build their future".
Organised by the Overseas Singaporean Unit, which is under the Prime Minister's Office, each Singapore Day is held in key cities. It was inaugurated in 2007 in New York and has since been held in Melbourne (2008), London (2009) and Shanghai (2011).
