JOHANNESBURG - South African police have arrested a Vietnamese man suspected of being in illegal possession of 10 rhino horns, one elephant tusk and cash with a total value of nearly US$3 million (S$3.7 billion), an official said on Wednesday.
South Africa, the country home to the most rhinos in the world, has been losing almost two of the threatened animals a day to poachers who sell the horns in China and Southeast Asia for use by the affluent as a traditional medicine ingredient.
&ldquo;There was a tip-off that we acted on speedily in fear that the suspect may try to dispose of incriminating items,&rdquo; police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo told Reuters.
The man, who has yet to be identified, is expected to appear in court on Thursday. He was arrested on Tuesday night in a Johannesburg-area apartment and the suspected contraband was seized.
Despite evidence showing rhino horns are useless as medicine, their street price is higher than gold.
