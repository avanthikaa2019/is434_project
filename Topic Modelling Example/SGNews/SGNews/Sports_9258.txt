OMAHA, Nebraska - Nathan Adrian led the way into the 100m freestyle final at the US Olympic swimming trials on Thursday, his time of 48.33sec putting him among the top 10 performers this year.
Seven of the fastest eight men in the semi-finals broke 49 seconds in the event, but Ryan Lochte and Matt Grevers, both already assured of London Games berths, scratched from the final.
That means 36-year-old veteran Jason Lezak, whose astonishing surge past Alain Bernard clinched the 4x100m free relay gold for the United States four years ago in Beijing, will swim in the final after posting the ninth-fastest semi-final time of 49.05.
Lochte, who is 1-1 in close finals duels with rival Michael Phelps this week, said he would skip the 100m free on Friday to concentrate on the 200m backstroke - which he won in Beijing - and the 200m individual medley - which promises another showdown with Phelps.
"I have a hard double tomorrow, a 200 back, 200 IM," said Lochte, who notched the equal fifth-fastest semi-final time, with Scot Robison, of 48.91sec.
"I know I have enough time to do the 100 free, but we made a plan going into this meet that I was just going to do semi-finals of 100 free and whatever happens, happens, and just get ready for the 200 back, 200 IM."
Grevers, already booked to swim the 100m back in London and going for a 200m backstroke berth, also dropped the 100m free final, having entered the event with the aim of posting a time good enough to earn 4x100m relay consideration.
"I don't like them," he admitted of doubling up. "I don't have the recovery system that Michael and Ryan do."
Phelps had opted out of the 100m free altogether, although his times in the event and past Olympic relay performances keep him in the relay mix.
The Americans will be hard-pressed to retain the 4x100 free gold they won in Beijing.
Australia boasts the top two 100m free men in the world right now in James Magnusson (47.10) and James Roberts (47.63), with Matt Targett also in the top 10. France boasts a wealth of freestyle sprint talent, as do Russia and Brazil.
