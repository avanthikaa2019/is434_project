Singapore's population challenge is "serious" but "not insurmountable", Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said during Monday's Parliament sitting.
Mr Teo, who is also Minister in Charge of population policies, said the current citizen population will shrink and grow older if the fertility rate remains low and Singapore closes its doors to immigrants.
DPM Teo mapped out how the Government has introduced various measure to address this issue.
One key strategy is to grow a strong core of Singaporeans who can contribute to the economy.
This can be done through raising productivity to encourage more locals to enter the workforce.
The Government is helping Singaporeans upgrade by continuing education and skills training programmes, DPM Teo said. New educational institutions in the arts, design and technology can also give Singaporeans greater opportunities to develop their diverse abilities.
The National Population and Talent Division's Overseas Singaporean Unit is also keeping overseas Singaporeans updated on local developments and opportunities.
Policies are also in place to ensure that older Singaporeans can look forward to an active and secure future, he said.
