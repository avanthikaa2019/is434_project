TOKYO - Tokyo police arrested two American men on Saturday as part of an investigation into the suspicious death of a female Irish exchange student, reports said.
One of the men was with Nicola Furlong, 21, when she was found dead early Thursday in a Tokyo hotel room, national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News said. An autopsy showed she may have been strangled, Kyodo reported.
The men, aged 19 and 23, were detained on suspicion of giving alcoholic drinks to Furlong's friend, also a 21-year-old Irish woman, and then groping her inside a taxi, Kyodo said.
Furlong was studying in Takasaki city about 95 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Tokyo, Kyodo said, citing police sources.
The two women were visiting Tokyo Wednesday night to see a concert, and were approached by the men, Kyodo said.
The four of them later went to the hotel where the men were staying. Furlong went into the room of the 19-year-old American, while the other woman went with the other man, Kyodo said.
In the early hours of Thursday, a hotel guest complained about a loud noise from one of the rooms.
A hotel employee went to the room and found Furlong on the floor lying near the bed and the US teen standing nearby, Kyodo said.
