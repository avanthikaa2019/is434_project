QUEBEC CITY - International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said Thursday that Japan's wavering power supply is a concern for hosting the 2020 Games.
"We know that the disaster of Fukushima has had an effect on the power supply, because nuclear power has been shut down and so in times of peak consumption there might be a shortage of power," Rogge said.
"The IOC will follow the evolution and we trust the Japanese will find a solution for that. They're one of the most important economies of the world so we believe they can handle that."
The resource-poor country used to draw about one-third of its electricity from atomic power, but last year's tsunami-sparked meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant has generated anti-nuclear sentiment among a wary public.
Japan's 50 commercial reactors have all been switched off, and when - or if - they will be restarted remains uncertain.
Last week, Japan's government called on the nation's homes and businesses to cut their energy use by as much as 15 per cent amid fears that nuclear plant shutdowns will spark power shortages and blackouts.
