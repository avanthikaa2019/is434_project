LIVERPOOL, United Kingdom - Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has criticised officials for taking supporters for &ldquo;granted&rdquo; ahead of next month's FA Cup final against Chelsea.
Rail maintenance work, coupled with a lack of trains following a match that kicks-off at 5.15pm local time (1615GMT) at Wembley in north London on May 5, have left many Reds fans with awkward journeys from and back to the north-west.
That is, if they can get hold of a ticket, with Liverpool's allocation of 25,000 out of a Wembley capacity of 90,000 some 7,000 fewer than they received for their semi-final against Merseyside rivals Everton.
&ldquo;Sometimes that is the problem when fans are taken for granted not just our fans but those at all football clubs,&rdquo; said Dalglish.
&ldquo;That is the decision which has been made and it's been made outside of our control,&rdquo; the Liverpool great added.
&ldquo;It could have been made a bit easier for them but they are fantastic fans and they will get there.&rdquo;
