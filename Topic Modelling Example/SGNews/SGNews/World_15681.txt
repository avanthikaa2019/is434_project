CARACAS - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez left for Cuba late Saturday to undergo a third round of radiotherapy in the hope of beating his cancer diagnosed last year.
The Venezuelan leader announced his own departure in an upbeat Twitter message sent from the airport.
"We are already on the runway of Simon Bolivar International Airport," Chavez twitted. "Heading for Havana with faith in Resurrected Christ. We'll keep living and keep winning!"
The new trip to Cuba comes after Chavez spent time with family members in his native state of Barinas in the west of the country.
Chavez, 57, who is facing a tough re-election fight this year, is expected to complete five weeks of radiation treatment in Havana, but return home for brief periods during that time.
