KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia - The 2-year-old boy, who was abused here, is in stable condition after doctors removed a blood clot from his brain on Saturday evening. He is still unconscious after undergoing surgery.
State Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant Commissioner K. Manoharan said Mohd Danish Aiman Abdullah was hooked to a life support system to help him breath.
The boy was believed to have been abused by his mother's boyfriend at the suspect's home in Kampung Manir here on Friday.

Manoharan said the man was believed to have gone into hiding after the victim's mother lodged a police report on Friday night.
He urged those with information about the suspect to call the nearest police station.
Danish was believed to have been hit by the suspect after an argument with the victim's mother at his house on Friday.
The victim suffered serious head injuries and fell into a coma. The case is being investigated under Section 31(1)(a) of the Children Act 2001.
