SINGAPORE - 33 per cent of young adults surveyed have expressed a desire to take their mothers on a holiday as present or token of appreciation.
Online travel agency CheapTickets.sg conducted a survey on 100 respondents, aged 20 to 35 years old, to find out what they would like to do for their mothers for the upcoming Mother's Day on May 13.
It found 20 per cent of them have taken their mother on holidays previously to nearby destinations such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.
45 per cent were planning to 'take mom out for a meal', 39 per cent were going to 'buy her a gift' and 11 per cent were going to 'take mom on a holiday'.
Proximity and affordability were two primary considerations when selecting which places to travel.
Bali, Japan and Korea were among the top three Asian destinations which respondents would like to take their mothers, while Paris and London were the preferred European destinations.
The results indicated that young Singaporeans aspire to fulfil their mother's wishes of visiting a particular country. Also, increased affluence has enabled them to afford regular travel, even to faraway destinations such as Europe.
When asked to rank their choice of activity during a vacation with mom, sightseeing came up tops (51%), followed by enjoying the local cuisine (37%) and shopping (35%). The findings resonate with Singaporeans enjoyment of food and shopping.
