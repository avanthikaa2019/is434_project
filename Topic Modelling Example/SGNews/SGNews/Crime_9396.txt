SINGAPORE - A taxi driver has has been jailed three months for molesting a 20-year-old passenger on May 22, 2010.
The Straits Times reported that the woman boarded Rhemy Eusope's cab after midnight at Bukit Batok and was heading to Choa Chu Kang when the incident occurred.
The 42-year-old driver complimented the passenger on how nice she smelled and went on to ask questions about her boyfriends and her sexual habits. Then, he reached out his left hand to shake hands with the passenger and held on to her hands firmly. He would not release his grip and let both their hands rest on her knees.
The woman got scared at this point and tried to free herself by telling him to drive with both hands. Following that, she asked to be dropped off at Choa Chu Kang Street 54 instead of her destination at Choa Chu Kang North 6.
Rhemy continued asking her about her boyfriend, and upon reaching the destination, he told her to stay after she paid the taxi fare.
He moved quickly to the back seat and continued to touch her hand and even placed it on his thigh. He proceeded to compliment her looks and asked if she had sexy photographs.
As a tactic to get him to release her hand, she agreed to show him some pictures on her phone.
After that, Rhemy asked for a hand shake and as she shook his hand, he proceeded to kiss it and placed his hand over her shoulders and asked for a hug.
When she ignored him, he raised his voice and she gave in to the hug. While he was hugging her, he brushed his hand down her back.
Finally, she pushed herself away and was about to exit the taxi when Rhemy forced kisses upon her cheeks and forehead.
After freeing herself, she called her boyfriend who told her to make a police report.
Rhemy, who has a similar previous conviction, pleaded guilty.
