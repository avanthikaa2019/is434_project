KARAVLASI, Bosnia-Hercegovina - A German girl has been rescued by Bosnian police after allegedly being held captive by a couple for eight years, during which she was forced to eat pig feed and pull a horse cart.
A neighbour who raised the alarm said that he witnessed the couple treating Ms Bettina Siegner, 19, like an animal.
Milenko and Slavojka Marinkovic were arrested at their home, in a village in the north-western Tuzla region, after police received the tip-off from neighbour Sead Makalic earlier this month.
"They kept her locked up - neither allowing her contact with other people, nor to go to school," police spokesman Admir Arnautovic told FTV public television. "They subjected her to inhumane treatment and torture."
The couple were arrested on May 17 but police said on Sunday that they could not reveal further details of the case, while prosecutors were not available for comment.
The girl, who has not been named by police, was placed in a safe house and was receiving medical treatment, investigators quoted by FTV said.
Mr Makalic said he remembered Ms Siegner arriving in Karavlasi with her mother and two sisters, but did not take much notice of her arrival.
Years later, he said he saw her eating pumpkin and corn grain used to feed the couple's pigs.
One day, he saw them make her pull a horse cart "while they were sitting on it".
"They put her in place of the horse and were laughing," he said.
"When I saw her again on May 15, I took a picture of her with my cellphone and alerted the police."
