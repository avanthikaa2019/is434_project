SEPANG, Malaysia - Ketamine weighing 12kg hidden in frames of ornamental mirrors were among the drugs worth RM1.83 million (S$752,679) seized by KLIA Customs Department from 3 foreigners in 2 separate cases on Thursday.
At 2.30am, an Indian national who arrived at the Low Cost Carrier Terminal from Bangalore with a social visit pass had brought 12 pieces of face mirrors. Scanners revealed suspiciously unidentified objects at the back of the mirrors, which prompted further checks by the Customs enforcement unit.
They were twelve 1kg white powder in plastic packs, positively tested to be ketamine worth RM480,000.
KLIA Customs Department deputy director Siti Baya Berahan said it was the second time the 26-year-old man from India had entered the country.
"He first came to Malaysia last year, in November," she said.
The second case involved 2 male tourists from Hong Kong that were found with RM1.43 million of assorted drugs in a raid at a condominium in Kuala Lumpur by the Customs federal narcotic unit and KLIA enforcement unit earlier at 12.30am.
"Syabu, ketamine, cannabis with Ecstacy and Eramin-5 pills were found in the unit where the men, aged 56 and 60, stayed," Siti Baya said.
She added that the raid was conducted after information were received from the public and the Customs intelligence operatives.
All suspects are remanded for two weeks starting Thursday under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act which carries the mandatory death penalty, if convicted.
