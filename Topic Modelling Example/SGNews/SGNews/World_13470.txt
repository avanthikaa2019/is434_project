MOSCOW - Russia's newly sworn-in President Vladimir Putin on Monday proposed his Kremlin predecessor Dmitry Medvedev as the country's new prime minister under a job swap agreement first announced last year.
The lower house of parliament's speaker Sergei Naryshkin said Putin submitted Medvedev's name for confirmation shortly after taking the oath of office for a third Kremlin term.
The State Duma lower house is expected to hold a special session on Tuesday to consider Medvedev's candidacy.
Medvedev's confirmation is all but certain after both the ruling United Russia party and the LDPR group of the veteran populist Vladimir Zhirinovsky promised to support Putin's choice.
Russian news agencies said Medvedev would begin holding formal consultations with party leaders ahead of a confirmation vote that may come as early as Tuesday evening.
Putin had served as Medvedev's prime minister after ceding his Kremlin seat to his close ally upon the completing his constitutionally-mandated first two terms as president between 2000 and 2008.
The former KGB veteran promised to appoint Medvedev his prime minister in September when the two leaders announced a job swap agreement whose secrecy helped feed the street protests that shook Russia in the winter months.
He was elected to a newly-extended six-year presidential term with 63.6 per cent of the vote on March 4.
