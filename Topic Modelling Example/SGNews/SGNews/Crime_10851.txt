A University of Georgia professor famous for his life-long study of German literature and history has been charged with prostitution in a suburb of Atlanta, officials said.
Max Reinhart, 65, was arrested Thursday afternoon after investigators answered an online ad listed by an individual on Backpage.com, according to local media reports.
The website has an "adult" section that includes "escorts" and "bodyrubs."
According to local reports, investigators said Reinhart wrote an ad in the "Transexual Escorts" section.
After spotting it, the police arranged a meeting at a hotel room rented by Reinhart. He used a name "Sasha," reports added.
The professor was arrested after negotiating US$60 (S$77) fee for services.
He was later in the evening on US$4,800 bond, reports said.
Reinhart is a leading scholar on German studies. He founded The Conference Group for Interdisciplinary Early Modern German Studies which invites other scholars from the arts and sciences to promote German society and culture.
