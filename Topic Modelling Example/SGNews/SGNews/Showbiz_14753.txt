Say what you will about this American rapper, who is fast outdoing the likes of Lady Gaga. The woman tries her darndest to give fans the biggest OTT, WTF moments. So on her second album, she flits between Barbie-fied pop princess and hardcore ghetto-b***h faster than you can say "Super Bass".
Some songs, like Come On A Cone, are pretty bizarre, but are nonetheless catchy.
