WARSAW - UEFA are looking into whether Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner broke player advertising rules by flashing the waistband of his underpants after scoring against Portugal, a source with knowledge of the matter said Thursday.
The 24-year-old striker scored twice in Denmark's 3-2 defeat in Lviv, Ukraine, on Wednesday as Morten Olsen's side battled back from a 2-0 deficit but were beaten with a goal three minutes from time.
The source told AFP they were checking if Bendtner broke Article 18.18 of the "Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010-12", which states: "All kit items worn during the final tournament must be free of any sponsor advertising."
That includes: "a) any event held at a stadium, from arrival at the stadium until departure from the stadium; b) for any training session designated as official by the UEFA administration; and c) at any official UEFA press conference."
The waistband of Bendtner's green and white underwear had the words of a Dublin-based online betting firm. The company, Paddy Power, said on its website that they were "lucky pants".
