The five members of City Harvest Church (CHC) who have been charged with alleged misue of funds are due to appear in court again on July 25.
CHC founder Kong Hee, vice-chairman Tan Ye Peng, chairman John Lam Leng Hung, investment manager Chew Eng Han, and Sharon Tan Shao Yuen were charged for conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust by agent.
For two years, from 2010, the Commissioner of Charities (COC) and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) conducted a concurrent investigation and inquiry into suspected financial irregularities inside CHC.
On June 26, 2012, the five were arrested over alleged misuse of church funds and alleged breaches under charity laws.
The COC revealed that financial irregularities of at least $23 million from the charity's funds have been discovered which it said were used with the purported intention to finance Ho Yeow Sun's secular music career to connect with people. Ho, 42, is Kong's pop singer wife.
A further $26.6 million in church funds is allegedly misappropriated to cover up the first amount.
The five have not pleaded guilty and are due in court on July 25. If found guilty, they could face lengthy jail terms, even for life.
