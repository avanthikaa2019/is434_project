Can a computer game predict the future of mankind?
A person who has been playing a "Civilization II" computer game for 10 years says the world of 3991 AD is "a hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation," according to news reports.
Reddit user Lycerius, who uploaded the post, said he has been playing the old game on and off for 10 years, and thought it might be interesting to see how far he could get.
According to the world depicted by the game, the ice caps will melt more than 20 times due to nuclear wars, and about 90 per cent of world's population will have died either from the wars or famine caused by global warming.
As a result, the majority of the world is a barren wasteland. People are unable to reclaim the farmlands or clean up the damage from nuclear fallout because they are too busy building roads to be used in war.
To cap it all, the tiny portion of humans that have survived are locked in a furious "1,700 year war," during which the Celts, the Vikings and the Americans are trapped in an eternal stalemate. Peace between the three remaining super-nations is virtually impossible because every time a treaty is signed, one will surprise attack another country.
Life for civilians is horrible because the continuous war leaves them in perennial starvation, and democracy evaporates from surface of the planet when it gets in the way of the effective conduct of war.
Lycerius says he wants to save his devastated world, and is seeking help from other Reddit users in resurrecting the dystopia.
