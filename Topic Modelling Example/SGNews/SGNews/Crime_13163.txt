IPOH - A minor was yesterday charged with murdering a close relative more than a week ago.
The 15-year-old is alleged to have murdered Jaswant Singh Udam Singh, 40, at a house in Taman Bersatu, Simpang Pulai, near here, between 11.30pm on April 30 and 12.30am on May 1.
No plea was recorded from the teenager who was charged in the chambers of magistrate Mohamad Nasrudin Mohamed.
Counsel K. Nahtan applied to have his client sent to Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta for psychiatric evaluation.
Deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Fauzi Md Yusof said he was still awaiting DNA and pathology reports.
Nasrudin fixed June 8 for mention.
Earlier, the boy was brought to court in a purple lock-up uniform with both his hands handcuffed. He looked around the court blankly when other cases were mentioned.
It was reported that Jaswant, a timber trader, was killed after he was allegedly stabbed to death by a close relative. His body was found in a room at the ground floor of a double-storey house, with multiple stab wounds to his abdomen.
