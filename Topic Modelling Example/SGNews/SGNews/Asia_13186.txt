The relatives of orphaned journalist Femi Adiningsih are praying that she has miraculously survived the Sukhoi plane crash, but solemnly admit they are ready to let her go.
"We still don't know what exactly happened. There's only news that all of the passengers died. We can only let go," Femi's aunt, Sutari Maria, said on Thursday at her house in Bumijo Tengah, Jetis, Yogyakarta.
"Both of Femi's parents have passed away. She only has her own elder sister, Esti Rahayu, who now lives in Jakarta."
Sutari said she had been consulting with Femi's sister about how and where the journalist would be buried if she was found dead.
The Russia-made Sukhoi Super Jet 100, which took off from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta, went missing on Wednesday afternoon.
An Air Force helicopter found the wreckage from the crash at 9:15 a.m. on Thursday, at a height of 5,500 feet, in the foothills of Mt. Salak in Cidahu, Sukabumi, West Java.
The plane, which carried 45 passengers in a demonstration flight, was found to have suffered "major damage".
A search and rescue team said they have discovered bodies, but had yet to identify them.
Femi, a Bloomberg journalist, lived in Bumijo Tengah until she finished her degree at Atmajaya Yogyakarta University.
Femi, described as a tomboy in her childhood, has loved taking photographs ever since she was a school student. She moved to Jakarta for work after graduating.
"Femi's book collections are still locked in her room. Her sister is carrying the key to Jakarta," said Sutari, who said she had been living next to Femi since she was a child.
Sutari said Femi most recently came back to Bumijo Tengah last September to celebrate her sister's wedding.
"No one expected anything. Many of Femi's friends have asked [about her]," she said.
