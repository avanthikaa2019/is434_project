BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN - The general lack of available and accessible data in the nation and in Southeast Asia may contribute to the lack of research initiatives, a senior member of the Seameo Voctech Regional Centre in Brunei said recently.
"In the area of education, especially vocational and technical education, research activities and research database are still very limited in Southeast Asia. The aggregate data are not easily accessible and not current, which may contribute to the lack of research initiatives," Dr Paryono, deputy director and research manager for Professional Seameo Voctech Regional Centre, told The Brunei Times.
He explained that SEAMEO-VOCTECH started an Online Journal System in 2007 that allows researchers to publish and search articles researched in Southeast Asia.
A lack of contributors, however, has resulted with a limited collection, he said, adding that the centre's website.
When asked if Brunei is in need of a consolidated database system to achieve an acceptable level of available research data, Dr Paryono said that following the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and other multi-lateral organisations, SEAMEO "has started providing educational statistics from the member countries.
This initiative should be enhanced with more comprehensive and updated data".
He also said that for comparability reasons, some aggregate education data could be included in a database at the SEAMEO Secretariat, and that SEAMEO-VOCTECH's databases could be more focused on vocational and technical education.
"The more specific data can remain at the national level," he said when asked whether the system should be spread across the ASEAN for the benefit of users.
SEAMO-VOCTECH is currently undertaking the latest of its scheduled training programmes, with a focus on improving decision making through research approaches.
