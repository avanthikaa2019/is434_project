Actor Aaron Johnson has married his film-maker fiancee Sam Taylor-Wood, who is 23 years his senior.
The British couple exchanged vows in Somerset, England, after three years of dating, according to AP.
The 22-year-old heart-throb and Kick-Ass star wore a Tom Ford suit, while Taylor-Wood, 45, donned an elegant gown created by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.
The newlyweds, who have two young children together, met on the set of the 2009 John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy, which Taylor-Wood directed.
They will both now use the surname Taylor- Johnson.
