Workers' Party (WP) candidate Png Eng Huat was back in the spotlight yesterday, as Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean raised the "new question" of his integrity.
In a statement to the media, Mr Teo also questioned WP's decision to send Mr Png, a candidate that its central executive committee (CEC) had "clearly decided was not good enough to send to Parliament", to contest the Hougang by-election.
Mr Teo said: "Voters should reconsider whether the WP is just tugging at their emotions but actually taking voters for granted."
On Monday night, an anonymous source leaked minutes of a WP extraordinary meeting held on May 12 last year, showing that Mr Png's name was included in a secret vote by the party's CEC for the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) post.
Mr Png had, however, told the media on Monday morning that he "took his name out of the ballot" as he was opposed to the NCMP scheme.
At Tuesday night's rally, WP chief Low Thia Khiang stressed that the selection of NCMPs lay with the CEC, and was not based on personal discretion. Mr Teo took this as confirmation that Mr Png had not told the truth and "had indeed been rejected by the WP CEC as an NCMP".
Mr Teo said: "For a First World Parliament, the basic prerequisite is that parliamentarians must be honest and truthful."
