For dog owners who live in high-rise apartments, the Dog Whisperer has a word of advice for you: Don't just walk your dog, exercise its sense of smell too.
Said celebrity dog-trainer Cesar Millan: "A 15- minute walk is not enough for a dog that is going to stay 23 hours and 45 minutes inside a house. The problem isn't living in a small apartment; the problem is that the human doesn't exercise the dog enough."
Therefore, he advised pet owners to engage their dogs in "nose activity", such as getting them to sniff out a hidden toy.
"You can drain their (pent-up energy) in 10 minutes if you challenge the nose," said Millan. This, according to him, is more effective than playing "fetch" a hundred times.
Millan, in town since last Saturday for his Cesar Millan "Live" tour, made a visit to the Animal Lovers League, a non-profit organisation located in Pasir Ris, yesterday.
There are 600 abandoned dogs and cats housed with its subsidiary, called Pets Villa.
There, he coaxed an eight-year-old mongrel named Mango to step out of its kennel for the first time in seven years.
For that period of time, volunteers at the animal shelter had been neither able to walk nor bathe Mango, for fear that he would bite them.
Yesterday, Mango finally left the kennel, and was taken for a swim and a run by Millan.
Millan observed that Mango had "learnt that if he puts up a fight, and if he shows the most vicious face he can show", he will be able to control people.
To overcome this, he told volunteers that they had to stand their ground and assert their authority, when faced with a similar situation in the future.
