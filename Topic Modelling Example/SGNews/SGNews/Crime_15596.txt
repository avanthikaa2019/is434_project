SINGAPORE - A man was today sentenced to 24 months' jail and six strokes of the cane for sexualling assaulting and molesting a 14-year-old girl.
On Jan 11 last year, Muhamad Ismail Kamarudin, 28, stumbled upon the victim and her boyfriend behaving intimately in a room at Woodlands Civic Centre.
He then asked for their identity cards and told her boyfriend to leave the room. Following which, he and the girl travelled by taxi to Woodlands Town Park East at Woodlands Street 13.
The Straits Times reported that Ismail kissed and touched the teenager at the hilltop of the park.
Defending himself, Ismail said the girl willingly followed him to the park and had allegedly tried to molest him.
District Judge Jasbendar Kaur backdated his sentence to Jan 13 last year as he has been held in custody for being unable to raise bail, the paper reported.
Ismail has previously been convicted for criminal breach of trust, fraudulent possession, gross indecency and robbery.
