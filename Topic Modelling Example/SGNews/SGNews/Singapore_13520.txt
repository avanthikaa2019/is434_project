Two separate fires were reported on opposite ends of Singapore yesterday, but no one was injured.
In the first incident, waste materials at an incinerator plant in Tuas View Crescent caught fire early yesterday morning. The 1,600 sq m plant is owned by Singapore company Eco Special Waste Management.
A Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) spokesman said a call was received at about 1am, and four fire engines, an ambulance and seven support vehicles were deployed to the site.
The fire was brought under control within half an hour. All 25 employees onsite at the time evacuated themselves safely before the SCDF arrived.
SCDF said it was investigating the fire.
Yesterday afternoon, the SCDF was alerted to another fire raging on a reclaimed island off north-eastern Singapore.
From about 2pm, 10 firefighters battled to put out the flames on the island between Pulau Tekong and the mainland with the help of SCDF marine fire vessels. A Singapore Armed Forces marine vessel was also called in to help.
The fire, which affected an area the size of a football field, was contained within a sand bunk wall. SCDF said the fire affected construction-site machinery and products used in land reclamation.
The blaze, which sent plumes of thick black smoke high into the air, was extinguished at 6.30pm by SCDF.
Stomp contributor Matthew Ho, 39, who works as a credit controller, told my paper that he could see thick, black smoke in the air while driving along the East Coast Parkway at about 3.30pm.
"The smoke was very dark and thick, but I could not hear or smell anything," he said.
