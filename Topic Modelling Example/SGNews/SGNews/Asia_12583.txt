Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra yesterday instructed top officials to rally behind the campaign to root out corruption, especially in relation to bribes being taken in exchange for government positions.
"Thailand would have a much better future if corruption, its biggest threat, is rooted out," she said.
Yingluck was speaking at a conference to unveil her government's anti-corruption strategy. More than 600 participants, including Cabinet members, heads of agencies, provincial governors and leading figures from the private sector, turned out in full force.
Over the past 18 years, Thailand has seen no significant improvement on various indices for transparency, Yingluck told the gathering.
Government officials are obliged to uphold the ideals of transparency and good governance, she said, adding that meritocracy should be encouraged so the tradition of accepting bribes to dispense job assignments can be stopped.
The government's four priorities are to raise anti-corruption awareness, encourage each agency to come up with a work plan on transparency, take a proactive approach to detect graft violation and ensure strict law enforcement on the suppression and punishment of graft offenders, she said.
Public Sector Development Commission secretary-general Thosaporn Sirisumphand said each agency would be given one month to come up with their work plan on transparency. Meanwhile, all public service outlets will have to put up a sign reading "bribes not accepted" in a move to remind officials and members of the public to not condone kickbacks.
