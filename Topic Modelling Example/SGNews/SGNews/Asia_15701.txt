SANAA, Yemen - The airport in Yemen's capital was shut down on Saturday after forces loyal to a sacked general close to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh surrounded it and threatened to shoot down planes, an airport official said.
"No aircraft has taken off or landed since these forces made their threat late on Friday," said the official, adding that the troops surrounding the airport were backed by members of the Hamdan tribe that supports former strongman Saleh.
Another official told AFP nine international and seven domestic departing flights had been cancelled, while three incoming Yemenia Airways flights were diverted to the main southern city Aden.
The airport has been encircled by forces loyal to air force chief General Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar, Saleh's half brother, who has refused to step down after being sacked by President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi, the source said.
The men were led by Naji Jamaan, a Hamdan tribal chief, the source added.
On Thursday, the UN Security Council expressed concern over recent events in Yemen, where followers of Saleh have been accused of hampering the political transition.
Ahmar has refused to go unless the defense minister and other senior officials also leave, a military source said.
In a message to his troops, Ahmar said Hadi's decree would not be implemented until Defence Minister Mohammed Nasser Ahmed, General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar - head of the First Armoured Brigade that protected anti-Saleh protesters last year in Sanaa - and chief of staff Ali al-Ashwal left their posts.
He also demanded that several members of the powerful Hashed tribe, which backed defectors during last year's anti-regime protests, be forced into exile.
In addition to Ahmar, Hadi also sacked on Friday Saleh' nephew, General Tareq Mohammed Abdullah Saleh, who heads the presidential guard.
