The National Basketball Association (NBA) sensation Jeremy Lin will be back in his parents' home country this summer for a youth basketball camp, Lin's agency in Taipei announced yesterday.
Lin, the NBA's first Taiwanese-American player, will be accompanied by his personal fitness coach and a shooting coach during the hoop camp to be held at a New Taipei City high school between Aug. 27-30, the agency said in a statement.
The two personal trainers will assist the New York Knicks point guard to stay fit and get ready for the next NBA season during his trip. The pair will also help Lin to coach young hoop talents at the camp, the statement said.
Taiwan will be a stop for Lin's upcoming trip to Asia this summer.
His agency, however, said that aside from the high school youth camp, it has not yet finalized the rest of Lin's schedule and does not have an exact date for his arrival.
The camp is targeted at basketball lovers between the ages of 9 and 16.
The final participants in the camp will be screened by event organizers in two stages, according to the agency.
