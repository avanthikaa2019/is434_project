ANKARA - Lawyers for Britain's Duchess of York on Friday attempted to settle a case brought against her after she secretly filmed a documentary critical of conditions in Turkish orphanages.
Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second son Prince Andrew, is accused of breaching the privacy of five children when she filmed with a hidden camera at an orphanage outside Ankara in 2008.
Cansu Sahin, representing Ferguson, who was not present, told the Ankara court her client was prepared to settle the case, the Anatolia news agency said, without giving details.
Turkish prosecutors have said they are seeking a prison term of between seven and 22 years.
Britain has already rejected a 2009 request from Ankara for the duchess's extradition.
The documentary, screened on Britain's ITV1 television channel in November 2008, depicted disturbing scenes at the orphanage for handicapped children, including one where a child was seen encased in a wooden box.
Over the years, Ferguson, who was divorced from Andrew in 1996, has been involved in a string of episodes that have caused embarrassment to the royal family.
