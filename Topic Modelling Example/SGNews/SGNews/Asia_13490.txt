BEIJING - Trade ministers from China, Japan and South Korea will meet on Saturday to talk about a possible trilateral free trade zone, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on Monday.
The ninth gathering of the three top trade officials, the first to be held in China, followed an agreement last week between China and South Korea to launch negotiations for a bilateral free trade area (FTA).
The start of the bilateral FTA negotiation between China and South Korea could be a risk for Japan, which has been pushing for a trilateral free trade pact.
"We will exchange views on topics about an investment pact and free trade zone between China, Japan and South Korea, as well as trilateral cooperation under the global and regional framework," the statement on the Chinese commerce ministry's website said.
China is the largest trading partner of both Japan and South Korea.
