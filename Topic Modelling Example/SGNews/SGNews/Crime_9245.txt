PETALING JAYA - A gang of thieves left empty-handed when their attempt to open an automated teller machine using an oxyacetylene torch emitted smoke, which set off the fire alarm.
The 3am incident occurred on the ground floor of Jusco in IOI Mall in Puchong.
Police had retrieved closed-circuit television camera images from the management to identify the culprits.
They left an oxyacetylene torch and break-in tools at the scene.
Serdang police chief Superintendent Abdul Razak Elias confirmed the case, but declined to elaborate.
