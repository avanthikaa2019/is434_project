A TEENAGER was given 15 months' probation yesterday after having sex with an underage girl from his lion dance troupe.
The 17-year-old boy also has to spend 150hours doing community service. His parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour.
The boy is not being named to protect the girl's identity.
The teenager had sex with the girl last July. She was then 14.
She had agreed to meet him to go shopping after school on July 4 last year.
However, when classes ended, the boy called her, claiming that he was unwell and asked her to buy him lunch.
The girl agreed and he texted her his home address. He later asked her to go up to his flat when she reached the void deck and again, she complied.
Once there, the boy invited her into his bedroom where she sat on the edge of the bed and chatted with him.
The court heard that he suddenly hugged her from behind, causing her to lie on the bed.
The pair then had sex.
The offence came to light when the girl lodged a police report at about 5.30pm on July 19.
For committing the offence, the boy could have been jailed up to five years and fined a maximum of $10,000.
