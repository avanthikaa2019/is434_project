SEOUL - South Korea football authorities said Thursday they have dropped Arsenal striker Park Chu-Young from next month's World Cup qualification games, amid controversy over his move to delay military service.
Park's name was not on the roster of players for a friendly against Spain in Switzerland on May 30 or for the qualification games for the 2014 Brazil World Cup - away to Qatar on June 8 and at home to Lebanon on June 12.
He has come under fire for delaying his compulsory military service by obtaining a 10-year residency visa for Monaco last year, when he played for AS Monaco.
South Korean football authorities had urged him to explain his position publicly on the controversy before the roster was announced Thursday.
"I think he should publicise his thoughts clearly (on the issue)," coach Choi Kang-Hee told journalists after revealing the 26-player roster.
"A national team must take into account not only an individual player's capability but the atmosphere of the whole team."
Choi said he and others had agonised over how much Park's presence would be helpful for the team.
"What is important is whether a player is willing to sacrifice for the team and whether he has pride in his team," Choi said.
The former national skipper has had a lacklustre first season at Arsenal, managing just six appearances since his move to London last August.
Allegations of draft-dodging are a sensitive topic in South Korea, where most men must undergo two years in the military.
