NAPLES, ITALY - Italy launched Europe's first private high-speed train service last week, as the country looks towards the more liberal economy that Prime Minister Mario Monti wants to put on the rails.
The dark-red, bullet-shaped "Italo" trains are run by NTV, a company headed by Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo, who wants to take a quarter of the market from state rail network Trenitalia, the biggest employer in the country.
"Italo has arrived, the competition has kicked off," NTV told its first passengers on an inaugural trip from Rome to Naples as they admired interiors that included a cinema carriage, leather seats and panoramic windows.
The project is one example of the new ambitions of the euro zone's third-largest economy under Mr Monti, a former European Union competition commissioner who plans to shake up a sluggish economy heavily influenced by protectionist traditions.
Economics professor Monti came to power in November, replacing Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and has said he wants to take on "vested interests" as well as calling for large-scale privatisations.
Said Mr Montezemolo: "We're talking a lot about growth. This is real growth for the country by someone who invests and takes a risk."
The company he heads had invested one billion euros (S$1.7 billion).
