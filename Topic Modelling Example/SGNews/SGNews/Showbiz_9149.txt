THEY haven't admitted it but the photos already say it all: US actress Megan Fox is pregnant.
The Transformers star has been evading questions about her impending motherhood, but now, with the paparazzi photos of her baby bump circulating on the Internet, the answer is obvious.
The 26-year-old actress flaunted her new figure while holidaying with husband actor Brian Austin Green, 38, in Hawaii, revisiting the country where they got hitched almost two years ago.
She had told reporters in March at a screening of her movie, Friends With Kids, that she's always loved children.
Green, who has a 10-year-old son, Kassius Lijah, with an ex-girlfriend, said at the same event that Fox is an &ldquo;amazing stepmom&rdquo; and that she and the boy &ldquo;love each other to death&rdquo;.
