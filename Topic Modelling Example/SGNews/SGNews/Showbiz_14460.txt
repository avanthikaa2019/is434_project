PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Actress Zahida Mohamed Rafik has gained more fame and Twitter fans following allegations of her relationship with a senior minister who allegedly paid her a substantial amount of money.
As at yesterday, the actress of the movie Anak Mami had garnered 7,000 followers on Twitter.
On Twitter, user Fared Isa tweeted to Zahida two days ago with "Hi millionaire. You kantoi already (You have been "caught"). Lol. I never heard your name before this till the news about you spread all over the country."
Zahida gave an amused reply, saying: "Cool!!! Keep it up ok! Need my beauty sleep now, nite! Esok jgn lupa tweet lagi tau (Don't forget to tweet again tomorrow)! Cheers! At least I am a millionaire, you???"
Many of her Twitter followers had previously made scathing comments about her alleged relationship with the minister, with the actress giving mostly witty replies.
To another Twitter follower who teased her about living an easy life now, Zahida replied: "Excuse me, I work hard for the money. If you have no money, I can derma (donate) a bit. It's ok, Allah knows the truth."
However, the trend changed yesterday when her followers began tweeting more positive comments to her, offering support and encouragement.
User Adlynn Jamlus said: "Bersabarlah dengan dugaan yang diberi..InsyaAllah ada hikmahnya..chill n cheers." (Be patient through the hard times, God willing, there will be a silver lining).
