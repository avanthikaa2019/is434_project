A national climate-change action plan outlining Singapore's strategy until 2020 was unveiled by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean yesterday.
The 136-page document, entitled "Climate Change &amp; Singapore: Challenges. Opportunities.
Partnerships", shares Singapore's plans to reduce emissions across sectors.
It covers areas that include developments in the clean-tech industry and on-going studies to understand the potential of climate change. It also includes details of how individuals, households and businesses have been doing their part in tackling climate change.
The document was launched at the National Climate Change Youth Conference 2012 held at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Mr Teo, who chairs the inter-ministerial committee on climate change, noted that the country's ability to tap on alternative energy, such as wind, solar and nuclear energy, is limited by its small size.
Speaking on the sidelines of the event, he said: "Nuclear power may be an option in the long term but, for now, because of our population density, it is not something we can tap on easily".
To get Singaporeans involved, the National Climate Change Secretariat also published a booklet to provide information on ways they can do their bit for the environment.
Titled "The fight against climate change begins with you", it illustrates, for instance, how much money one can save in a year by adopting energy-efficient habits.
The secretariat will also organise public-education and outreach programmes from September. These include a two-part documentary on the effects of climate change.
