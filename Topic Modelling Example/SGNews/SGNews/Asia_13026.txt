KYOTO, JAPAN - The Kyoto prefectural government has incorporated into its disaster prevention plan a measure to utilize temples and shrines in the city as temporary shelters for people, including tourists, unable to return home after a major earthquake, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.
There are about 2,000 temples and shrines in the city. In cooperation with the Kyoto city government, the Kyoto prefectural government will ask for their cooperation, according to the sources.
An average of 135,000 people visited the city daily in 2010, with more than 200,000 per day in a period in November. If a big earthquake were to occur during the day, most of them would likely be unable to return home.
Because many temples and shrines have various buildings, including a main hall, living quarters and accommodation facilities, they are suitable as temporary shelters. Moreover, famous temples and shrines are easy for people, including tourists, to find.
Among them, Ninnaji and Kinkakuji temples--both registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites--have been designated by the city as wide-area evacuation sites, which can accommodate 11,500 people. Ninnaji has an 80-tatami-mat, or 240-square-meter, accommodation facility.
"If we're asked [to serve as a shelter], we're willing to help," one temple official said.
"In its long history, Kyoto has had many temples and shrines survive disasters," said Prof. Takeyuki Okubo of Ritsumeikan University, who specializes in disaster management for cultural heritage. "They have great potential as shelters."
