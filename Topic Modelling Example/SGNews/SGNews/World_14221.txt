SYDNEY - Infamous Australian crime figure Mark "Chopper" Read has revealed he has terminal cancer and could have only weeks to live.
Read, who shot to worldwide fame after the 2000 film "Chopper" about his violent life, starring Eric Bana, took to Twitter on Thursday to break the news about his failing health.
"Looks like the big C has finally bitten. Let's see how we go," tweeted Read, who in the past has claimed to have been involved in the killing of 19 people.
"I actually feel OK. Some more surgery in a couple of weeks and hopefully I'll be ready to rock 'n' roll after that."
Read, who is in his late 50s, told News Limited newspapers he has four tumours on his liver and could have just six weeks to live.
"I've got liver cancer. They say there's no way out of it," he said.
"As long as the bleeding stops, I don't give a bugger."
Read, who has spent a total of 23 years in jail, is a celebrity in Australia after retiring from a life of crime to write novels, including 1993's "How to Shoot Friends and Influence People".
During his criminal career, he says he was stabbed seven times, shot once, run over by a car, had a claw hammer embedded in his head, and made to dig his own grave.
His most notorious act was having a fellow inmate hack off both his ears to gain access to a prison's mental health wing during a war between rival factions.
