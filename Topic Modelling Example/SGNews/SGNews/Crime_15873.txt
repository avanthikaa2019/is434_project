The man accused of murdering 24-year-old Lie Lek Chee in a Jurong West flat will be held for three more weeks at Changi prison for psychiatric assessment.
37-year-old Gabriel Lee Haw Ling, represented by Mr Subhas Anandan and Mr Sunil Sudheesan, did not attend the mention at a district court on Thursday as he was ill.
He had a medical certificate valid till Thursday, but it did not list any details of his illness, Mr Sudheesan said.
He also told local media that he had not met or spoken to his client, but hopes to visit him in prison in three weeks' time to prepare the defence.
According to local media reports, Mr Sudheesan also said Lee's family members were shocked at the turn of events and were said to be "quite shaken", but remain "extremely supportive" of him.
Paramedics found Elsie Lie's body on the queen-size bed in one of the bedrooms. She had suffered injuries and was pronounced dead at 7.30am.
A bald man, said to be the dead woman's boyfriend, was subsequently arrested at the scene. If found guilty, he faces the death penalty.
He allegedly slashed his lover, gouged out or tore out certain body parts and threw them out of the window.
These were subsequently retrieved by the police.
