YOKOHAMA, JAPAN - Jack Wilson will get another shot at some silverware in the Land of the Rising Sun when he runs out today for the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club at the 53rd YC&amp;AC Japan Sevens.
A week after helping New Zealand grab third spot at the Tokyo Sevens, the son of former All Black Brett Wilson swaps the famous black jersey for the blue of the hosts--though he has some famous boots to fill.
Fiji sevens legend Waisale Serevi played for the hosts from 2008 to 2010 helping the club to three championships.
"I don't like having a star player next to my name," Wilson admitted Saturday. "It will be interesting."
Wilson flew back to New Zealand after last weekend's tournament and only arrived back in Tokyo on Saturday morning.
The 22-year-old said he hadn't needed much persuasion to make the journey, but admitted New Zealand coach Gordon Tietjens had to be worked on.
"We've got a few injuries to key players, so Titch was a little reluctant. But this will give me some conditioning and game fitness ahead of the [HSBC Sevens World Series] tournaments in Scotland and England."
The YC&amp;AC may be the three-time defending champions but their last triumph came in 2010. Last year's tournament was canceled in the aftermath of the events of March 11, and in memory of that the organizers have invited Kamaishi Seawaves from Iwate Prefecture.
The Top East club and its players won plaudits for the way they helped in the rescue and recovery of their city, which was decimated by the tsunami that hit after the huge earthquake.
"After the year they had and all they went through as a club and community, it's great to see Kamaishi at Japan's oldest sevens tournament," said Simon Ryan, president of the YC&amp;AC rugby club.
