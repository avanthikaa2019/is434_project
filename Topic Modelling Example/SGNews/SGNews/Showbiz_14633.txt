After four years of domestic bliss, there's something on singer Ning Baizura's mind - a child. &ldquo;My husband (Omar Shariff) was so busy being my manager and building my beauty businesses, that we really didn't have the time. Now, I'll be getting someone else to be my manager, so that I can have babies with my husband,&rdquo; she jokes. The 37-year-old has been very busy later with shows, recording and conceptualising a new album of big-ballads, that she says will be out by year-end under Universal Music. &ldquo;Yes, we've been busy but the time is right to have a child now,&rdquo; she says glancing at her husband. &ldquo;No pressure! No pressure!&rdquo; she laughs, glancing at him, again. Besides wanting a &ldquo;real&rdquo; baby, Ning also wants to make more &lsquo;musical babies.' The success of the 2011 album 3 Suara , a group effort with singers Jaclyln Victor and Shila Amzah introduced Ning to a whole new generation of fans. Ning is currently finishing off the theme song to the upcoming movie Lagenda Budak Setan 3 - a melodic, tear-inducing ballad called Sejati . The song is written and produced by Indonesian songwriter Winda Benjamin. She is also preparing some intimate live shows in June at Alexis Bistro in Kuala Lumpur and the Hard Rock Caf&eacute; in Penang. &ldquo;It's going to have a Latin element to it. It's going to mix covers with my own songs,' she says. She said this after a sold out Secretaries Week performance at the Federal Hotel , which saw secretaries swarming towards her to take pictures of their idol singing. She jokingly told the crowd that felt like she selling stuff at a &ldquo;pasar malam.&rdquo;
