A robber who tried to rape a 20-year-old woman ended up injuring his genitals when she slashed him with the parang that he had dropped.
She was heading to a grocery store near her house in Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, at 4pm on Thursday when the man confronted her and held a parang to her neck.
He dragged her to a dark spot nearby, pushing her to the ground and demanding cash and jewellery, a police source told Harian Metro.
When she refused, he reached into her pocket and took out RM100 (S$41) and her mobile phone.
Despite her pleas to be left unharmed, the man kept stepping on her and ordered her to take off her clothes.
When she refused, he tried to remove her pants.
"The woman took the chance to kick him. He lost his balance and the parang fell from his hands. The woman quickly grabbed the parang and slashed his genitals," he said.
