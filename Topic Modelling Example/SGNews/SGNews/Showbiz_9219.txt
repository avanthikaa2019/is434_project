Paris Hilton is always an easy target for mockery.
Recently, the 31-year-old heiress was ridiculed for her awkward dancing and off-tune singing to her new single Last Night during her debut as a deejay at thePop Music Festival in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
At one stage of the one-hour set, Hilton even fumbled over the equipment, prompting a staff member going on stage to help fix the sound levels.
Hilton, who sported dazzling headphones and a matching microphone, was certainly oblivious to the boos from the concert-goers.
"I could not have been happier with the crowd's reaction to my set," Hilton told E! News.
"It felt so good to be in control of the party and see everyone dancing!"
