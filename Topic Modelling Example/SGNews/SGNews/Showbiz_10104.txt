MONTREAL - The drummer for the British rock group Radiohead paid homage Sunday to Scott Johnson, the sound technician killed when an outdoor stage set up in a Toronto park for a group concert collapsed.
"We have all been shattered by the loss of Scott Johnson, our friend and colleague," drummer Phil Selway wrote in a brief statement posted on the group's website.
Johnson died around 2000 GMT Saturday when part of the metal-frame stage at Downsview Park collapsed, a Toronto police spokesman said.
Johnson "was a lovely man, always positive, supportive and funny; a highly skilled and valued member of our great road crew. We will miss him very much.
"Our thoughts and love are with Scott's family and all those close to him," read the message, signed simply "Phil."
The late Johnson, 33, was a native of Doncaster, England, according to a group spokesman cited by Canadian media.
The Saturday accident occurred about three and a half hours before the show was to start.
The concert was canceled and officials opened a probe into the cause of the accident. Contrary to early speculation, there were no strong gusts of wind at the time the stage collapsed.
According to Radiohead's official website, the Toronto concert was sold out. Downsview Park can accommodate up to 40,000 spectators.
