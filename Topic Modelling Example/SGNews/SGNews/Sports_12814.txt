The Singapore LionsXII team dropped two crucial points last night in their chase for the Malaysian Super League title, after managing only a 0-0 draw against bottom-placed Kuala Lumpur.
The Lions came into the match stung after last Saturday's 3-3 home draw with Kedah, but failed to find the net in the absence of top scorer, injured captain Shahril Ishak.
Last night's result put them under great pressure of ceding the top spot to second-placed Kelantan.
They still lead the table with 41 points from 21 games. Defending champions Kelantan are four points behind but have played four fewer matches.
