South Korean rhythmic gymnast Son Yeon-jae won another bronze medal on Saturday at a World Cup Gymnastics meet in Sofia, Bulgaria, bringing home the nation's second medal in the competition.
The 17-year-old won the bronze in the ribbon final with 27.300 points at the World Cup series. This is the second time a Korean athlete has brought home a medal in a series sanctioned by the International Gymnastics Federation. Son also took home the bronze in the hoop final on April 29 at the World Cup series in Penza, Russia.
On Friday, Son also scored 109.800 points to take seventh place overall.
Previously, Son advanced to 10th place in the individual all-around at a World Cup series and this is the second time that the athlete has advanced to the final four in any discipline.
Son was also the first Korean to bring home an international medal at a discipline final, winning a bronze medal in the hoop at the Grand Prix in Moscow in February.
Son's victory comes after she won a bid for the 2012 London Olympic Games by taking 11th place during the 2011 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships in Montpellier, France.
Son, a native of Seoul, currently trains in Russia.
