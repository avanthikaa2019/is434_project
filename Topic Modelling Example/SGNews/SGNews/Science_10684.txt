An open-source project is being developed to offer the same kind of experience that iPhone and iPad users have, but without the need to own an Apple device.
Called Project Magenta, it is an "implementation of Darwin/ BSD on top of the Linux kernel" that will be "fully binary compatible with iOS 5.0", the project said on its website.
However, the Project Magenta operating system will not be able to access applications on Apple's App Store.
