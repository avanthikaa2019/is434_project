Fresh out of school and fresh into a relationship, Ngee Ann Polytechnic graduates Woo Wan Fong and Matthew Yang are also much-needed fresh blood in our local film industry.
The young couple blew the judges away and bagged the top prize at the second edition of The New Paper FiRST Film Festival yesterday (April 5, 2012).
Named after the number of squares on a chessboard, their winning entry '64' is a silent film which compares life to a game of chess.
Local filmmaker Jack Neo, one of the judges of the film awards, was all praise for the film's cinematography. "The lighting is well done. It's well-shot and well-edited. The acting is great as well. There were no dialogues scripted for the actors, and yet we are able to understand the whole story purely from watching the actors' expressions."
The 52-year-old veteran said he is keen to help develop '64' into a feature film. He might also cast its lead actor Louis Law, who won Best Male Performance, in his upcoming military comedy Ah Boys to Men.
Check out what made this movie a winner.
