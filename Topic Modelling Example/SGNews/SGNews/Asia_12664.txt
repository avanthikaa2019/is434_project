About 15% of Japanese men aged between 30 and 40 have never had sex because they fear being laughed at by women who are generally more sexually experienced, reported Kwong Wah Yit Poh.
Quoting a professor from Japan's Meiji University, the report said Japanese women, even those below 20, had become more sexually active than men in the last decade.
This resulted in men preferring to remain as virgins as they feared being laughed at by the more sexually experienced women.
He said many men with limited sexual knowledge felt inferior and did not dare pursue women.
This subsequently has lead to many men remaining unmarried and old-aged virgins.
