JAKARTA: Pop diva Lady Gaga's show in Indonesia has been cancelled, her promoters said today after Islamic hardliners threatened "chaos" if she entered the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation.
"Lady Gaga's management has considered the situation minute to minute, and with threats if the concert goes ahead, Lady Gaga's side is calling off the concert," Minola Sebayang, lawyer for promoters Big Daddy, told reporters.
"This is not only about Lady Gaga's security, but extends to those who will be watching her," he added.
Earlier this month Jakarta police refused approval for the show after the hardline Islamic Defenders Front threatened violence if Lady Gaga performed, calling her a "devil's messenger" who wears only a "bra and panties" on stage.
The promoters had indicated that a deal was being hammered out to tone down the star's racy show, but her own management vowed no compromise to appease religious conservatives or censors.
Big Daddy president director Michael Rusli said it was "unfortunate" that the show had to be called off.
"For the past few days we have communicated with the government and Lady Gaga's side. The government has given support, but this is not about the permit," he said. "The cancellation is really due to concerns over security."
