MANILA, Philippines - It's official, Jessica Sanchez is going to the Finals of American Idol.
She will be the first contestant of Filipino descent to make it to the finale of the popular reality television singing competition.
The results were announced Thursday night (Friday Manila time), a day after the nationwide vote following performance night where Sanchez sang Mariah Carey's "My All", Aerosmith's "I Dont Want To Miss A Thing", and The Jackson 5&prime;s "I'll Be There."
She earned the nods of the judges for almost all songs except for "Idol" judge Randy Jackson's review that Sanchez's third performance lacked the "moment-moment."
Sanchez, a 16-year old American of Filipino and Mexican descent, competed against Joshua Ledet and Philip Philips for the Final Top Two round.
The show's finale will be held on May 23 where the new "American Idol" will be crowned.
