A double nominee at the upcoming 31st Hong Kong Film Awards, veteran actor Sean Lau Ching Wan is glad that he has double the odds of winning the Best Actor trophy in the face of strong rivals like Andy Lau.
The 48-year-old is nominated for his roles in Johnnie To's Life Without Principle as well as Alan Mak and Felix Chong's Overheard 2. Both are critically-acclaimed crime thrillers.
Andy Lau, on the other hand, is nominated for his role in Ann Hui's heartwarming drama A Simple Life. The soon-to-be first-time father is tipped to be the most likely winner so far. But Sean said he won't be putting in extra efforts to up his chances of winning.
"At this stage, I really can't do much," said Sean, who was recently in town for Italian luxury brand Tod's with his wife Amy Kwok, a former Miss Hong Kong winner and TV actress.
"Winning a trophy requires no confidence. Acting, however, requires a lot of confidence, and I always use up my confidence after filming wraps," the unassuming actor added.
His other competitors include China-born actors Jiang Wen and Ge You, both nominated for their roles in Let the Bullets Fly.
The Hong Kong Film Awards will be held on April 15, 2012. But win or not, the prolific Sean will still be seen tackling a variety of roles in a string of new films, including Derek Yee's cop thriller The Bullet Vanishes and The Pang Brothers' 3D disaster film Inferno.
