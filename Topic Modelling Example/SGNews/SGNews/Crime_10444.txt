The police have arrested a 35-year-old woman who used her old address to borrow from loansharks.
She was arrested yesterday afternoon at Hougang Ave 9 after preliminary investigations revealed that she had used her previous residential address to obtain illegal loans from loansharks.
As a result, the current owner and occupants of her previous residence became the victims of loanshark harassment.
Investigations also showed that she failed to report the change of her residential address within 28 days.
Police investigations against the suspect are on-going. Under the Moneylenders Act (Revised Edition 2010), any person who is guilty of providing false contact information to obtain loans from loansharks shall be liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.
Under the National Registration Act, any person who is guilty of an offence of failing to report a change of address shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
