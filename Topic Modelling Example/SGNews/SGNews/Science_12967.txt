WASHINGTON - More smartphones means more Americans are using the devices to get location information or to share their whereabouts with friends, a study showed last Friday.
A Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project report found 74 per cent of US smartphone owners use the device to get real-time location-based information, and 18 per cent use a geosocial service to "check in" or share their location.
Over the past year, smartphone ownership among US adults has risen from 35 per cent to 46 per cent, the study noted.
This means that the overall proportion of US adults who get location-based information has almost doubled over that time period, from 23 per cent in May last year to 41 per cent in February this year.
The percentage of US adults using geosocial services like Foursquare has likewise risen, from 4 per cent last year to 10 per cent this year.
"We've watched mobile phones become increasingly entwined in people's everyday activities, and location-based services are an important part of that," report author Kathryn Zickuhr said.
"Smartphones' geolocation abilities are clearly popular with their users, who can get the information they want exactly when and where they want it."
The jump in location services has also raised privacy issues and has prompted lawmakers to consider efforts to protect the privacy of people whose location can be tracked.
The Pew report surveyed more than 2,000 adults last year and again this year and is believed to have a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points.
