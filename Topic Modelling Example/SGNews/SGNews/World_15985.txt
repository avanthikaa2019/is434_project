WASHINGTON- US First Lady Michelle Obama appeared on Tuesday night's episode of "The Biggest Loser" to promote her campaign against obesity - and has hosted the US diet reality show's first White House workout.
The six competitors still vying for the title of "Biggest Loser" - the one who loses the most weight - got the shock of their lives when they were invited to Washington by the wife of US President Barack Obama.
After having makeovers for the occasion, the six contestants met Obama and were reunited with loved ones - prompting floods of tears of joy.
"Congratulations, you have shown to millions of Americans that each of us can make positive changes in our lives," Obama said in a video message to contestants.
"It's overwhelming for me," said 43-year-old competitor Mark. The scenes of Obama working out with contestants at the White House are due to air next Tuesday, according to NBC, which broadcasts the program.
