Mr Lin Jun's parents flew to Montreal from China to meet Canadian authorities and university officials.
They were unable to speak and the 33-year-old's mother was "crying all the time" and "could barely walk" after landing in the country where her son was brutally killed.
They arrived at Concordia University, where Mr Lin had been studying, and met investigators as well as university officials, the Daily Mail reported.
What Mr Lin's parents will not be able to comprehend is why their gentle son met such a violent end.
On his blog, Mr Lin called himself Big Bad Justin, but in reality, according to his postings and his acquaintances, he was a quiet, unassuming man who came to Canada to study engineering and computer science.
But there was a dark side to him.
On Valentine's Day last year, he posted a computer-altered photograph of himself with wild purple hair and a cracked face with a mouth of broken and missing teeth.
"My self-portrait," he wrote beneath the repulsive image, the Globe and Mail reported.
In another online posting a month before he was murdered, Mr Lin took a photograph of an empty Montreal subway car.
His mystifying caption "midnight cannibalism train" led some Chinese Internet users to speculate that he was foreshadowing his own gruesome death.
He also used as his online username Justin Rain, the name of an actor with a minor role in the Twilight vampire movie saga.
More than anything else, he hoped to find a partner. When asked at Montreal's Tyark College what his goal in life was, he had said that his biggest ambition was to find love.
Recalled Miss Alexandra Afanase, a fellow student in business class: "That is what I remember about him. He was in computers, and he was looking for love."
