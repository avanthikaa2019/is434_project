Web celebrities and people known to be involved in scandals are not allowed to be guests on TV shows, according to the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT), Southern Metropolis Daily reported Tuesday.
Li Wei, SARFT's deputy director, said that TV programs, especially news programs, should not be too recreational or vulgar.
Li added that programs focused on providing career services would be banned from boosting audience ratings by spoofing job seekers.
