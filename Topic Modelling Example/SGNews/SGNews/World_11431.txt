PARIS - French police said Saturday they are actively hunting a Canadian porn star suspected of filming the dismemberment of his boyfriend and mailing the body parts.
A police source said "targeted searches" were under way for Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, amid reports he might be in France, after an airport official said passenger lists of flights from Canada were being checked, so far without result.
The police declined to say whether the searches were linked to the behaviour of Magnotta, dubbed "Canadian Psycho" by the popular press, on previous visits to France, or definite reports that he was in the country.
Police said Friday they had no certainty about Magnotta's presence in France.
Interpol on Thursday issued a Red Notice wanted persons alert for Magnotta, also known as Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov, to its 190 member countries after a video of the grisly killing surfaced online.
Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail meanwhile quoted unnamed sources as saying he could be in France.
