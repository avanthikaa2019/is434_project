NEW YORK - Pop star Rihanna was briefly hospitalised in the US this week and posted a picture on Twitter showing her arm hooked up to an intravenous drip, with media reports citing "exhaustion" and "dehydration."
Several entertainment news websites reported Wednesday that the Barbados-born singer was admitted after attending the Met Costume Ball in New York on Monday night. She had for several days told her Twitter followers that she had been feeling sick.
But when the updates stopped on Tuesday one fan who tweeted Rihanna to ask what was going on prompted the singer to post the picture which showed her trademark long black fake nails and a fluids drip taped up to her arm.
The mediatakeout.com website reported that Rihanna had suffered exhaustion and dehydration after a night of hard partying at the Met, but said she was now "doing better" and had flown back to her home in Los Angeles.
The New York Post, meanwhile, quoted an anonymous source as saying the singer had become sick from "excessive partying and not slowing down."
