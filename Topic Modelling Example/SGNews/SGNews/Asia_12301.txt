DENPASAR, Indonesia - Indonesia has agreed to a clemency plea by convicted Australian drug trafficker Schapelle Corby, slashing five years off her 20-year jail sentence, a court official said on Tuesday.
"The clemency letter for Schapelle Corby was issued on Monday with the approval of the president and with that Corby's jail sentence is reduced by five years," said Amzer Simanjuntak, spokesman for the Denpasar district court on the island of Bali, where Corby is imprisoned.
Corby, 34, was convicted in 2005 of smuggling 4.1 kilograms (nine pounds) of marijuana and is serving her sentence at the overcrowded Kerobokan prison.
She filed a clemency appeal about two years ago to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, when her lawyers said she should be released on humanitarian grounds because of mental illness.
Her lawyer, Iskandar Nawing, has said that Corby had been driven insane at Kerobokan, one of Indonesia's most notorious prisons, whose 1,000 inmates include 60 foreigners, 12 of whom are Australian.
The prison houses murderers and paedophiles and has also been hit by outbreaks of violence, including in February when it was taken over for several days by rioting prisoners after a gang stabbing.
The president has the final decision on clemency, with the power to reduce or overturn jail sentences.
