Singapore popstar Stefanie Sun uploaded a photo of herself on her Weibo micro-blog account, asking readers if they could tell if she was pregnant.
Posted on Thursday evening, Sun, 34, still looked slim without a noticeable baby bump.
This was the first photo Sun has posted since announcing her pregnancy on her micro-blog on Monday morning.
Many of her celebrity friends sent their congratulations over the micro-blog site.
Chinese singer Na Ying commented on the post, asking Sun to post another picture in three months' time when it is more visible.
Sun tied the knot with Dutchman Nadim van der Ros, 35, on March 31 last year and held their customary Chinese wedding banquet on May 8. They are expecting their first child.
