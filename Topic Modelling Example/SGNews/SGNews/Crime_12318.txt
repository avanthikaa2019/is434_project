JAKARTA - Customs officials in Sanggau Regency, West Kalimantan, have allegedly foiled an attempt to smuggle 406 grams of crystal methamphetamine (locally known as sabu-sabu) from Malaysia to Indonesia.
The suspect, JN, was arrested on Sunday after being examined by border officials in Entikong.
"At first, officials became suspicious because of the way he moved when his passport was being examined," customs officer Safarudin said on Monday, as quoted by kompas.com.
"Officials searched him and found four packs filled with white powder in the pockets of his pants."
The officials brought the packs to the local branch of the National Drug and Food Monitoring Agency (BPOM) to examine their contents and identified the substance as meth, he said.
Previously the Customs and Excise Directorate Office revealed that in 2012, drug smuggling attempts via Soekarno-Hatta International Airport were dominated by Malaysian drug syndicates, with 85 per cent of foiled attempts hailing from that country.
