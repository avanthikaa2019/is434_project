Moving to Orlando, Florida - where he pursued a master's degree in the entertainment business two years ago - didn't mean that home-grown rocker Shyam Raj was going to stop making music.
Last year, the former frontman of comedy-rock quartet Thambi K Seaow and grungemetal outfit Withered Tree embarked on his latest project, and the result is this four-song EP, which is about "being broken down to be built (up) again".
Impressively, each song has been recorded straight through - that is, no creative editing, no bells and whistles.
Raj's extensive vocal range means songs like Caroline and the sprawling title track boast some awe-inspiring metal-style vocals.
