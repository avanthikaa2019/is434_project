A mother of five was jailed for three months after she pleaded guilty to stealing RM$81 (S$33) from a woman during a wedding.
Zurina Ahmad, 38, yesterday apologised to the court saying she stole the money to use for her daily expenses.
However, Senior Magistrate Hj Nabil Daraina said he felt the defendant was not remorseful and sentenced her to jail time.
The maximum term she could have received was seven years under section 370 of the Penal Code.
Court documents stated that housewife Zurina attended a wedding with her husband at a home in Kg Bukit Beruang on June 17.
Around midday she left the wedding party to explore one of the upstairs bedrooms, belonging to the victim Izzah Hafizah Hj Ali Bahrom. The defendant rifled around the room until she found RM$81 inside a wallet in a dressing table drawer.
However, the grandmother of the victim had noticed Zurina going upstairs and asked one of her relatives, Siti Noorhamidah, to go check on the defendant.
When the defendant was discovered standing in front of the dressing table she told Siti Noorhamidah that her scarf had come loose and someone had asked her to look for a pin in one of the rooms.
Once Zurina had gone downstairs, Siti Noorhamidah told Izzah that the defendant had been in her room, and she then discovered that the money was missing from her wallet.
Izzah confronted the defendant who initially denied she stole the money, but when they asked her to hand over her handbag they discovered the missing money.
Zurina later admitted to the theft upon police investigations.
