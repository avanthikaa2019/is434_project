ATHENS - A makeshift bomb exploded outside a tax office in Athens early Monday, a police source said, causing damage but no injuries as the debt-mired country struggles to to form an emergency government.
The explosion outside the tax office in Maroussi, a suburb north of the city centre, occurred at 3.08 am (00:08 GMT, 8.08am Singapore time).
The device is believed to have been made from gas canisters, a method usually employed by radical anarchist groups.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Greek political parties were on Monday to resume last-ditch talks to form an emergency coalition government after inconclusive elections on May 6.
If no deal emerges by Thursday, when the new parliament reconvenes, new elections will have to be called, a prospect dreaded by EU peers as it could mean further delays to the country's promised structural reforms.
