WASHINGTON - Three friends who work in Maryland's public school system have claimed a third of the record $656 million (S$827.9m) Mega Millions jackpot, the Maryland lottery said Tuesday.
"We are thrilled that three such deserving Marylanders have won this money," said Maryland lottery director Stephen Martino said on the lottery's website.
"It's gratifying to know that these individuals, who have given so much to the public through the years, have had this wonderful luck. It couldn't have happened to nicer people," he said.
Calling themselves the "Three Amigos," the three public school workers arrived at the headquarters of the Maryland lottery with their financial advisers, and picked the $158 million cash option, the lottery said.
After taxes, they will each take home just under $35 million, it said.
The lottery did not identify them by name but said one was a woman in her 20s, a man in his 40s, and another woman in her 50s.
The three shared one of the three winning tickets in the March 30 drawing for the record $656 million dollar prize, the largest in US lottery history.
Tickets with the winning combination of 2, 4, 23, 38, 46 plus Mega Ball 23 were sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland amid an unprecedented nationwide lottery-buying frenzy.
Kansas lottery chief Dennis Wilson said his state's winner turned up at his offices in Topeka shortly before noon Friday with a lawyer and financial officer in tow - as well as a request to stay out of the headlines.
