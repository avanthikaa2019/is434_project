SINGAPORE - More than 100 trees in total were uprooted over the weekend because of stormy weather and exceptionally strong localised winds.
The National Parks Boards (NParks) told the media that 13 trees were Sunday uprooted near the tracks at Changi Beach Park while another 100 were discovered to have fallen within the park itself.
Heavy rains had also saturated and softened the soil in the area.
A total of 10 more trees in other parts or Singapore were also affected by the strong winds.
No reports of injuries were received, and all trees causing obstruction have been cleared.
NParks advised members of the public to refrain from visiting parks and nature reserves during stormy weather.
