PARIS - Berenice Bejo, co-star of the hit French silent movie "The Artist", is to host the Cannes film festival opening and closing ceremonies next month, the festival's chairman told AFP on Wednesday.
Gilles Jacob confirmed reports that the French actress, who won a Cesar award in France and an Oscar nomination for her role in the movie, will host both ceremonies in the Riviera city, on May 16 and 27.
Organisers are to announce the 20-odd films in the official Cannes competition at a press conference in Paris on Thursday, with just under a month to go before the world's top movie showcase.
