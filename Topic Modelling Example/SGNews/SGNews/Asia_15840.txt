Since March 31, when national healthcare subscribers were given the right to seek free emergency care from all hospitals, the 1669 and 1330 hotlines have been receiving as many as 300 enquiries daily. Dr Paijit Warachit, secretary general of the Public Health Ministry said the ministry's coordination centre has also been getting about seven calls daily.
Paijit said most of the callers wanted to know what entitled them to emergency services, while many were worried that they might have to pay later.
He also said that the National Health Security Office was looking into providing free emergency medical services to one and all.
