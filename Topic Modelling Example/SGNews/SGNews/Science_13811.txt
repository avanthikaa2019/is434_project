UNITED KINGDOM - A gigantic crab more than 100 times bigger than a standard British shore crab is about to hit United Kingdom, according to news reports.
The Tasmanian giant crab "Claude" was caught by a fisherman in Australia and was sold to a British aquarium for about US$4,900 (S$6,154).
He weighs a whopping 6.8 kilograms, has a 40 centimeter shell and has enough flesh to make more than 150 crab cakes.
Despite his size, he is not yet an adult and is expected to grow to double his current size.
