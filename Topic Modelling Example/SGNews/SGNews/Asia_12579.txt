TANEGASHIMA, Kagoshima - Japan launched an H-2A rocket early Friday that put a commercial satellite into orbit for the first time.
The rocket was carrying four satellites, including a South Korean commercial satellite, when it was launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture at 1:39 a.m. Friday. All satellites were confirmed to have been put into orbit, the center said.
This was the 21st H-2A rocket to be launched and was the 15th time in a row that one blasted off without a hitch, raising the rocket's success rate to 95.2 per cent. The only time a rocket failed was the sixth launch in 2003.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., which was in charge of the launch, intends to make a full-scale entry into overseas markets for satellite launches, company officials said.
"We could emphasize the strong reliability of our rocket technology," said Motohisa Furukawa, state minister for space development.
"The government will support [the rocket industry] to secure opportunities for commercial launches," he added.
The H-2A rocket carried a South Korean multipurpose satellite known as KOMPSAT-3 or Arirang-3, two Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency satellites, Shizuku and SDS-4, and a Kyushu Institute of Technology satellite, Horyu-2.
Arirang-3 is equipped with an optical camera, which will be used to take high-resolution images to gather geographical information as well as environmental and agricultural data. Shizuku will measure rain and vapor to monitor global climate change and water circulation.
The cost of the launch was not announced because it was a commercial operation.
