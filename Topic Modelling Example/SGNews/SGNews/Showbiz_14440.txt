NEW YORK - Troubled actress Lindsay Lohan will portray Hollywood legend Elizabeth Taylor in a television movie about her romance with actor Richard Burton, Lifetime said Monday.
Production will begin in June in Los Angeles for the movie "Liz and Dick," Lifetime said in a statement.
"We are thrilled Lindsay will portray beloved Hollywood legend Elizabeth Taylor," Rob Sharenow, executive vice president of Lifetime, said in a statement.
"She is one of the rare actresses who possesses the talent, beauty and intrigue to capture the spirit of such a provocative icon."
Lifetime said the up-and-down romance between Burton and Taylor, who died last year at the age of 79, was "the most notorious, publicized and celebrated love affair of its day.
"Swarmed by paparazzi, Taylor and Burton's love affair was played out entirely in front of the global press from the time they met," yet, "Taylor and Burton shared an undeniable love greater than most people could have ever dreamed."
The role is a break for Lohan, 25, who after a promising early start has become known chiefly as a hell-raising celebrity with substance abuse problems and frequent brushes with the law.
"I have always admired and had enormous respect for Elizabeth Taylor. She was not only an incredible actress but an amazing woman as well," Lohan said.
"I am very honored to have been asked to play this role."
