SINGAPORE More employers here have resorted to hiring older foreign maids, as younger candidates shun working in Singapore.
According to four maid agencies quoted in The Straits Times in the past three months, 30 per cent of the maids hired were above 30 years of age, up from 15 to 20 per cent last year.
The owners of the agencies expect the proportion to go up to about 50 per cent in the next six months.
Younger maids in their 20s prefer to work in countries like Hong Kong and Taiwan, where the pay is higher, the report said. Many are also waiting for the compulsory day-off policy to kick in on Jan 1 next year, before they will come in.
Under the new ruling which was announced in March, employers must give their hired maids, or those whose work permits are renewed, a weekly rest day.
However, employers can have the option of giving their maids a day off in lieu within the month, or give them monetary compensation that amounts to at least their daily wage.
The trend of younger maids shunning work in Singapore has come as a boon to the older ones, who are often viewed as less energetic and less adaptable.
A larger number of older maids are also seeking employment here, agents said.
Maids in their 30s, who tend to be less fluent in English, are finding it easier to pass the mandatory language test, which has become easier in recent months, The Straits Times said.
