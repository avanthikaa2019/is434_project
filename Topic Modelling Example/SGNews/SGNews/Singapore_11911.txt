The Housing Board's inaugural Community Week has reached out to more than 20,000 people - including over 5,000 youth - through 41 activities and programmes.
The week, which ended yesterday with a welcome party for new residents in Yishun, was aimed at encouraging residents to bond with each other in order to build community spirit.
