About 4,900 Singaporeans living, working and studying in the US gathered at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York to celebrate all things Singaporean at Singapore Day 2012.
Organised by the Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU) in the Prime Minister's Office, Singapore Day is held in key cities with a significant number of Singaporeans.
Participants were treated to the antics of comedian Hossan Leong, as well as Singaporean dishes whipped up by local hawkers flown 15,000 kilometres to the location.
Hawker Cheng Kong Sang of Toa Payoh Rojak said that he was honoured to be at Singapore Day once again after his first experience in 2009 in London.
The 81 year-old maestro, who served up 1,500 plates of rojak at Singapore Day 2012 with his son-in-law Lim Swee Seng, said he was very happy to travel halfway across the world to serve Singaporeans his signature rojak.
Mr Cheng hoped that Singaporeans who've tasted his rojak in New York will visit his stall at Old Airport Road for another round when they next return home.
The event also saw the showcasing of the Singapore Memory Project - a new initiative that tells the story of the country through collecting shared memories from Singaporeans on what Singapore means to them.
This year's event was graced by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of National Population and Talent Division Teo Chee Hean.
In his remarks, DPM Teo highlighted the need for an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore.
DPM Teo said that despite the island state's transformation over the years, Singapore remains our home and a place for Singaporeans to build their future.
He expressed hoped Singapore Day would bring Singaporeans closer and enjoy a slice of home together; and that it would foster close-knit Singaporean communities around the world.
