The Harry Potter film series may be over, but at least one of its acting alumni may now be eyeing a career behind the camera.
Redhead English actress Bonnie Wright, 21, who played Harry Potter's girlfriend Ginny Weasley, had her directorial debut Separate We Come, Separate We Go screened earlier this week at the Cannes Film Festival.
The short film - which was shot on a budget of &pound;5,000 (S$10,000) as part of Wright's graduate project at the London College of Communication - tells the story of an unlikely attachment between a lonely child (Emily Dunham) and a man wrestling with grief (Harry Potter co-star David Thewlis).
