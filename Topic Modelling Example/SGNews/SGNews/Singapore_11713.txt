SINGAPORE - During the horrifying hour that she was stuck under the lift, Madam Rose Tay banged repeatedly on the floor of the lift, hoping to attract attention.
The 82-year-old woman had been trapped under a lift that had come crashing down on her and Filipino maid Clarita Abanes, 46, in the Church of St Michael on the evening of May 16.
She told The Straits Times (ST) that she encouraged Ms Abanes to bang on the floor of the lift as well, and they did this continuously for the next hour.
Although the noise did not manage to attract the attention of the congregation which had gathered upstairs singing hymns, it caught the attention of the church dogs, which started barking and alerted the other people in the church.
"So actually, the dogs saved us," she told the ST reporter.
The devout Catholic said that when she saw the lift coming down, she prayed to Joseph, Jesus and Mary in her heart to save her.
While Madam Tay managed to survive the ordeal, Ms Abanes did not.
Ms Abanes suffered more serious injuries and blacked out during the ordeal, and passed away in hospital a week later from her injuries.
Madam Tay expressed regret that it was because Ms Abanes was helping her into the lift that she died.
The elderly woman said she had gone to the church alone for evening mass, and had met Ms Abanes and her employers on the ground floor.
Ms Abanes was asked by her employers to help Madam Tay into the lift.
According to Ms Abanes' cousin, who gave her name as Ms Logie, it was likely that Ms Abanes did not notice that the lift had not descended to touch the ground floor when she pulled open the glass doors of the lift.
