JOHOR BARU - A two-year-old boy was taken on a terror ride by a car thief who drove off with the child as the mother and two other siblings went into a supermarket.
However, the child was dropped off about 30 minutes later.
The theft took place in Kangkar Pulai at noon yesterday.
It is learnt that the woman had driven her three children to the supermarket to buy some groceries and left the two-year-old inside the car with the engine running.
