SINGAPORE - The two women charged for assaulting their neighbour over a dispute involving the burning of incense and joss paper in August 2011 have been fined $1,000 each.
One of them, 37-year-old Ong Siok Bee, was fined another $1,500 for endangering the man's safety by throwing a flower pot at him.
The neighbour, 52-year-old Seow Hung Lye, later suffered chest pains and died about an hour after the fracas.
He and his 49-year-old wife had been burning incense and joss paper outside their Paya Lebar Crescent terrace house when their neighbour Tan Phui Moi, 45, came to their gate to take pictures for a police report.
Seow tried to grab the camera while his wife used a broom to hit Tan. Tan's adopted sister, Ong, joined the fight with a broom.
The two sisters then threw flower pots at Seow.
They only stopped after Seow's son sprayed insecticide on the two sisters, allowing Seow and his wife to retreat into their house.
Seow became breathless and unconscious. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he died at 5.45pm.
The two women were fined $1,000 each on Wednesday by a district court for committing affray.
