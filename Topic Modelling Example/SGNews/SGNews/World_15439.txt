MACAU - US billionaire Sheldon Adelson said on Wednesday that he plans to spend US$35 billion (S$44 billion) on a mini-Las Vegas strip in Spain, where he is courting the country's two top urban areas, Barcelona and Madrid, with plans for a casino complex.
Las Vegas Sands Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Adelson also said he was looking to build in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.
Adelson was speaking at a press conference ahead of the opening of his new US$4 billion casino property in Macau, the world's largest casino destination.
Las Vegas Sands said in February that it was studying an investment of as much as 15 billion euros (S$24.7 billion) over 10 years in a casino complex in Spain, which would include 36,000 hotel beds, 18,000 slot machines and three golf courses.
Under its US$31 billion Macau unit Sands China Ltd, the group already has two casinos open in the former Portuguese colony.
