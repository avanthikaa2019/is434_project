IT IS double happiness for True Blood stars Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer.
The 29-year-old Oscar-winner and her husband of nearly two years are expecting twins.
This is Paquin's first pregnancy, while the 42-year-old Moyer has two kids from previous relationships - Lilac, 10, and Billy, 12.
Their co-star, Sam Trammell, 43, let slip the news that Paquin "is actually eating for three". Trammell told Us Weekly magazine: "I'm so excited for them. It's so interesting that True Blood has become, like, the 'twins show'."
Trammell is a father to 11-month-old twin boys.
