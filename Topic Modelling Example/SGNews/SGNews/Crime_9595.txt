A group of four senior citizens got together to dupe another elderly woman in a gold coin scam earlier this year.
Yesterday, Malaysian Yap Bun Kwong, 66, was sentenced to three months' jail after he admitted to deceiving Madam Lam Lai Yin, 70, into believing that she was investing $10,000 to buy gold coins. But there were no gold coins.
Yap - a Singapore PR - and his group of Singaporean accomplices, had the common intention of cheating Madam Lam.
He was the second man to be jailed in the scam.
On March 27, one of his co-accused, Mohamed Sarip Ejang, 72, who was involved in the same scam, was jailed three months.
Two other men - Sum Hone Yang, 80, and Poh Choon Hoe, 53 - are on the run.
The court heard that on Feb 15, Yap and Sum had approached Madam Lam at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange and offered to help her find a job.
Yap later contacted Madam Lam and asked to meet her the following week at the same bus interchange, on the pretext of arranging a job forher.
On Feb 21, at 11am, Yap and Sum met Madam Lam.
They were later joined by Mohamed Sarip, who came up with a story that his brother had been hospitalised after an accident andhad asked him to sell some gold coins.
Mohamed Sarip then showed Madam Lam a small gold coin and claimed that he had 3,000 of them for sale at $380 each.
He said the coins were stored in a warehouse and he needed $80,000 to retrieve them.
Yap and Sum convinced Madam Lam to invest $10,000 to retrieve the gold coins to sell.
They also told her that she would get a commission of between $1,000 and $3,000 for her investment.
Yap then accompanied Madam Lam to a nearby POSB bank to withdraw $10,000. Madam Lam handed $2,000 to Yap and the balance of $8,000 to Sum at Bugis Junction later the same day.
Yap has made a restitution of $2,500. He could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined.
