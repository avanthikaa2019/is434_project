Maid agents here are appealing to the Indonesian Embassy to change its mind on a new hiring fee policy set by the Indonesian government.
The new structure, which took effect on May 1, disallows agencies from earning commission from maids hired here. Agencies who do so risk being blacklisted by the Indonesian embassy.
Agents The Straits Times (ST) spoke to said that costs incurred from helping maids find employers would have to be passed on to the employers If the matter is left unsolved.
They are unwilling to absorb the fees, which range from an average of about $675 to $900, depending on the maid's salary.
The agents also told ST that they wanted officials from the Association of Employment Agencies (Singapore) (AEAS) to help sort the problem out with the Indonesian embassy here.
About 40 maid agents have requested for the AEAS to announce their stance on the issue.
When contacted, AEAS head Ms Jayaprema told ST that an extraodinary general meeting will be held on the matter.
According to ST, Mr Sukmo Yuwono, a counsellor at the Indonesian Embassy said that maid agencies could charge maids service fees if they manage to obtain permission from the Indonesian recruiters and maids involved.
Under the Employment Agencies Act, maid agencies are allowed to charge a service fee, which does not exceed one month of the maid's salary. This service fee can be charged for each year of the duration of the contract, as long as the total amount does not exceed two months of the employee's salary.
There are about 103,000 Indonesian maids in Singapore currently but this number could fall if frustrated maid agencies turn to other countries for their supply of domestic helpers.
