OKLAHOMA CITY - LeBron James and Dwyane Wade proved they were not yet ready to pass the torch to the next generation by leading the Miami Heat to a 100-96 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game Two of the NBA Finals on Thursday.
James scored 32 points and Wade added 24 as the veteran-laden Heat rebounded from Tuesday night's lacklustre 105-94 setback to even the best-of-seven series at 1-1.
Oklahoma City fought back from a 13-point deficit in the last nine minutes and trailed 98-96 when Kevin Durant missed a five-footer with 10 seconds left.
James was fouled on the rebound and calmly sank two free throws with seven seconds to play to seal the victory.
Durant, the NBA's scoring champion, finished with 32 points, including 26 in the second half.
The best-of-seven series shifts to Miami for Game Three on Sunday night.
