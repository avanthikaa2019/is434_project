Move over, Rihanna - there's a new bunch of Barbadians on the block.
On their debut album, this quintet seem to draw influence from earlier RiRi, with almost all 12 tracks boasting similar reggae- lite beats and sexy pop stylings.
Lead singer Amanda Reifer sounds like a combo of the Umbrella singer and No Doubt's Gwen Stefani, albeit a little less in-your-face, which actually works on sunkissed numbers like Headphones.
Check out lead singles Lick Ya Down and Twilight, both of which have all the makings of summer smash hits.
