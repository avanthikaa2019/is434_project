Google is removing URLs from its search function, but before anyone cries foul, it's letting people know about it, CNet said.
The tech giant released an edition of its Transparency Report - which shows who is requesting URLs to be taken down, copyright owners, and all targeted domains since last July.
Everything that is deleted is allegedly copyrighted or pirated material - mostly from software and entertainment companies.
