BERLIN - German police shot dead a man who attacked them with an axe after they attempted to break up a row over a parking place, prosecutors said on Monday.
The 47-year-old become embroiled in a heated argument with his neighbour over a parking spot outside their block of flats on Sunday afternoon, whereupon he pulled out an axe and set upon the other man, who was not identified.
The neighbour fled into his house, pursued by the 47-year-old who tried to smash down his front door with the axe.
When police arrived, the attacker "barricaded himself in the building and attacked the officers with the axe when they attempted to gain access to the flat", said a spokesman for prosecutors in the southern city of Augsburg.
"At this point, the officers used their weapons," added the spokesman, Matthias Nickolai.
Authorities said they had now launched a probe into the circumstances surrounding the incident.
