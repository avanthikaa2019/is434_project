Forty-five people have been arrested for suspected involvement in unlicensed money-lending activities.
The 34 men and 11 women, aged between 18 and 74, facilitated unlicensed money-lending activities by allowing their bank accounts to be used by loanshark syndicates to facilitate their business.
Investigations against those arrested are still on-going.
First-time offenders found guilty of assisting in the business of unlicensed moneylending may be fined between $30,000 and $300,000, be imprisoned for up to four years and caned up to six strokes.
