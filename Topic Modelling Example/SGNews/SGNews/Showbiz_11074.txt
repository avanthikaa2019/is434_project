By now, audiences would be familiar with Ben Stiller's lion, Chris Rock's exuberant zebra, David Schwimmer's shy giraffe and Jada Pinkett Smith's assertive hippo.

Stealing some of the spotlight is animal-control officer Captain Chantel DuBois, played with relish by Frances McDormand.
Drawn with fierce eyes and thin cruel lips, DuBois turns out to be a formidable match - even for the smart and devious penguins.
