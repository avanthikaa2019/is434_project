INDIA - A 38-year-old man went through an ordeal when he could not return money he borrowed from a colleague.
Supriyo Chatterjee's wife and son were abducted in Jagatpur, India, when he could not settle the loan, Tamil Nesan reported.
Fortunately, Gujarat police managed to rescue the mother and son, and arrest the abductor.
Supriyo, who worked in a jewellery workshop in Bhavnagar, live in a rented house with his wife and one-year-old son.
He borrowed Rs3 lakh (S$8 700.71) from Keur Ojha, who charged a high interest rate.
When Supriyo suddenly lost his job, Ojha started pressuring him to settle the amount.
Supriyo managed to pay Rs2.5 lakh and assured Ojha that he would settle the balance in a few weeks' time.
However, he was shocked when Ojha said that the accumulated interest had gone up to Rs3 lakh again.
Supriyo claimed that Ojha then abducted his wife and son and threatened to either kill them or sell them off if he failed to repay the outstanding amount.
Police have also arrested Ojha's wife and his parents.
