TOKYO - A Japanese policeman has been arrested for licking a woman's hair in a restaurant, police said Thursday.
Fellow officers detained forensics specialist Tatsuya Ichikawa, 50, at a fast food joint after he was spotted tonguing the locks of an unsuspecting 25-year-old woman in Shizuoka prefecture, central Japan.
"I wanted to lick so I did," Ichikawa told police, according to media reports.
A spokesman for Shizuoka prefectural police confirmed Ichikawa's arrest, adding that he was on medical leave at the time and did not specialise in the analysis of human hair.
