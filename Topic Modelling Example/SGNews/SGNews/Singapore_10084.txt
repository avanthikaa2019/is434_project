SINGAPORE - A small fire started out of a stall's ventilation ducting located at Joo Seng food centre yesterday afternoon.
Stallholders and customers at the premises at Block 1, Upper Aljunied Lane had to be evacuated to safety, reported The Straits Times.
Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that they received the call at 4.05pm. By then, everyone had already safely evacuated.
The fire was put out within 10 minutes as it was limited to the ventilation ducting above the stall and not threatening to spread, said the SCDF.
No injuries nor damages to other stalls were reported.
SCDF will continue to investigate to rule out any foul play.
