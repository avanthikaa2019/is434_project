PETALING JAYA - Less than 24 hours after Internet marketeer Chin Xin-Ci was nearly abducted at the car park of a shopping mall, two women were robbed of RM80,000 (S$32,000) from the same place on Monday.
The two, who work at a Japanese goods store on the second floor of The Curve, wanted to go to a bank on the ground floor to deposit the takings for the past three days.
They were about to enter the lift at 10.45am when two men came by and threw curry powder at their faces before grabbing the bag containing the RM80,000.
The men, who were not wearing masks, escaped in a blue Proton Wira parked outside the mall.
Deputy OCPD Supt Meor Hamdan Meor Mohamad said police had a CCTV recording of the incident.
"The staff screamed for help and tried in vain to give chase as the suspects fled via the emergency staircase," he added.
Workers at the store claimed that their colleagues, an accountant and a supervisor had curry powder thrown at them by the robbers.
The workers, who declined to be identified, said it was the first time that such an incident had occurred to them.
"Our company's standard operating procedure is that those responsible to bank in the money must use the escalator when they go downstairs to do it," the employee said.
The workers also said that many people working at the mall were now afraid for their safety after the robbery and the attempted abduction.
Chin was forcibly pushed into her car by two men after she went shopping at 5.20pm on Sunday.
She managed to put up a fight before escaping.
