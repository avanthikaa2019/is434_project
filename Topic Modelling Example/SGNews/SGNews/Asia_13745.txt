Police in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, are distributing pictures of Sri Hartuti, who they suspect is involved in a Rp 30 billion (S$423,000) fraud case, due to what they say is her failure to respond to a summons for questioning.
"We have sent several summonses, including to her lawyer. She would tell us that she couldn't come, saying that she was sick or on business. She hasn't answered any of our summonses to this day. This is why we're putting her on our wanted list. It's also why we're circulating pictures of her," Balikpapan Police chief Adj. Comr. Sabar Supriyono said on Wednesday, as quoted by tribunnews.com.
Police said that Hartuti encouraged her alleged victims to invest in her company, PT Chrisby Karunia Manunggal, a tourism and travel business.
Up until the middle of 2011, investors received the profits that they had been promised. Then the flow of money began to slow.
Several dozen investors who had pooled Rp 30 billion in her company soon found that Hartuti could not be contacted, and filed a report on her with the police.
