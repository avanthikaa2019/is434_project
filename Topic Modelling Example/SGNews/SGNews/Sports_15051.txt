Sprint star Usain Bolt made a triumphant start to his 2012 season under rainy conditions last Saturday, joking that the weather would prepare him for the 2012 London Olympics.
At the UTech Classic in Kingston, Jamaica, Bolt anchored the Racers' 4x100m relay team to victory in a year-best 37.82sec, beating an MVP club relay team, which included Asafa Powell and Dwayne Chambers, that ran 38.27.
