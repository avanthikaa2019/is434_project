A man was jailed for nine months today for molesting a woman police sergeant.
25-year-old Ilham Tumpang, a former part-time waiter, was found guilty of touching the then 27-year-old police officer's bottom at Mandarin Gallery on Jan 1 last year.
The Straits Times reported that the incident caused deep emotional stress to the victim, now 29. She was in uniform when she was molested.
Ilham, who had taken some alcohol, denied touching her buttock.
He is currently serving a 15-month sentence for three counts of theft and for driving a stolen cab without insurance coverage.
The jail sentence will run together with his current sentence.
He could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or received any combined sentence for outrage of modesty.
