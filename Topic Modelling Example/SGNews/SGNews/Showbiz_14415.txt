SINGAPORE - When K-pop superstar Kim Hyun Joong comes to Singapore in May, he will attempt to give high-fives to some 3,000 fans during his concert.
This is the first time any performing artiste to Singapore is attempting such a feat as high-five sessions are typically intended for a smaller group to allow fans a more intimate time with their idol.
Previously the high-fives were only opened to 500 lucky fans, but Kim has decided to extend it to everyone in the audience, said a press release.
The two-hour concert, held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on May 4, will showcase over 10 songs, dance routines and interactive segments.
One lucky fan will also stand to win a set of T-shirt and carton avatar brooch, designed by Kim himself for this Asia tour.
In Korea, the star's official animated character U:ZOOSIN sells like hotcakes. So far, some 50,000 units have been sold.
Tickets can be purchased via SISTIC online, hotline and counter bookings.
