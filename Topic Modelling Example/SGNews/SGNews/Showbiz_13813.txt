SINGAPORE's theatre darling Ivan Heng delighted audiences with his latest stage offering - Romeo and Juliet.
This was the first time that W!ld Rice has attempted to do a work of William Shakespeare and the play ran for April 12 to 28.
The story of two star-crossed lovers caught in the midst of feuding families, Romeo and Juliet, is probably one of the world's best known love stories.
Ivan Heng does well to tackle the difficulty that text presents and does not shy away from the moments of homoeroticism and vulgarity. Ivan tackled these with humour and had the crowd reacting with loud laughter.
The director 'Singaporean -ised' his showing of Romeo and Juliet, by having the cast deliver their lines in the local accent, without the Singlish.
Though it was easier on the ears, anyone unfamiliar with the Bard or the period may have still struggled with the dialogue.
Though most parts of the play's dialogue was made understandable by the cast's good acting, that did enough to make the words come alive through action.
A fine example is the opening scene, where Lim Yu-Beng who plays Sampson from the house Capulet sets the tone of the rivalry between the two houses with a line about the women from Montague, playing with the word 'maidens' and 'maidenheads'.
The crude humour behind the text would have been lost on anyone who does not understand it, but he puts his point across rather well with his actions and had the crowd in stitches, just as the Bard would have intended.
Ivan Heng also does well with a bare set that at most times only had a bed, a few tikki torches for a party and a screen for images.
The minimalistic setting allowed the actors to translate the text through their bodies and eliminate any possible distractions.
To sum it up, Shakespeare would have been proud of Ivan Heng's production. It was done as the Bard would have wanted, without the stuffiness and entertainment that catered to the masses.
