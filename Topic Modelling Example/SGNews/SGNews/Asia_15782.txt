ANHUI, China - A woman who used a breast enhancement gel has been divorced by her husband after he blamed the steroid injections for causing their daughter's cerebral palsy, Guangzhou Daily reported Friday.
Zhou Shaoping, 40, from Anhui province, told the paper that she spent 5,000 yuan (S$997) having the product Amazingel injected in 2003 at a clinic.
She hoped getting bigger breasts could gain her more affection from men after she was betrayed by her ex.
In 2006, Zhou gave birth to a baby girl after meeting a new partner and one year later got married.
Though she thought her breast milk was unusually yellow, she still fed her baby for three months. The baby was later confirmed to have cerebral palsy, but it is not known if it was caused by the breast gel injections.
After Zhou and her husband spent all of their money trying to help find a cure for their baby they started to quarrel. When her husband discovered Zhou had used Amazingel in the past, he blamed her and left, the paper said.
Zhou said she gave up her career to look after her sick girl and had to go live with her parents.
She told the paper she suffers pain in her breasts, but she is not sure if it is caused by the gel.
