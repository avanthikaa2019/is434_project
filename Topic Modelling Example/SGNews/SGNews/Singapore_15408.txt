Toshiba yesterday officially opened a research and development (R&amp;D) centre that will ex- plore a more cost-efficient and environment- friendly way to treat industrial waste water in Singapore.
This is possible with a new method involving a reusable material called "functional powder", which absorbs toxic elements from the waste water.
The powder can also extract valuable elements - such as copper - from the water for recycling.
Toshiba also inked a Memorandum of Understanding with national water agency PUB yesterday to explore a collaboration to develop and test the application of the powder.
The facility, called the Aqua Research Centre, is set up by the Japanese firm's Social Infrastructure Systems Division and is its first water-treatment centre outside Japan.
The centre is located at PUB's WaterHub in Toh Guan.
Toshiba estimates that it will incur about 100 million yen (S$1.5 million) in costs for the research centre.
Toshiba's "functional powder" was invented in 2008.
As the powder can be reused more than 500 times, this method of waste- water treatment is about 40 per cent cheaper than conventional industrial water-treatment processes.
Using the powder is also more environmentally friendly, as it produces little to no chemical side products, unlike conventional treatment methods.
Toshiba aims to use its water-treatment process commercially in Singapore within two to three years. Together with PUB experts and analysts, it will begin testing a treatment-process technology that involves the "functional powder" at the new centre.
Mr Chew Men Leong, chief executive of PUB, said that Toshiba "will add vibrancy to the local water R&amp;D landscape, and boost Singapore's growing status as a global hydrohub".
In recent years, the Government has identified water as a strategic growth sector in Singapore, with R&amp;D as a key driver.
