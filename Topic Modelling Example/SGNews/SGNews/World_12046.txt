WASHINGTON - A gunman who held hostages at an Indiana real estate office shot himself after releasing them unharmed and has died, police said Friday.
The gunman "was transported to the hospital and later died in the hospital" after suffering from "two self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head" while holed up at the Prudential Executive Group Real Estate office, Valparaiso police Sergeant Michael Grennes told AFP.
The Post-Tribune cited the Porter County coroner in identifying the gunman was Roy Ferguson, 48, of Texas. It said the man entered the building with a gun believing an employee owed him money. Police would not confirm the gunman's identity pending notification of family members.
The standoff began at 10:05 am (1505 GMT), when the gunman entered the office and held an undisclosed number of people at gunpoint.
Police confirmed there was a brief exchange of fire between armed officers and the gunman. A female employee then left the building with a head injury she received from the gunman, though it was not a gunshot.
"She was transported to Porter Hospital and has since been treated and released," the Valparaiso Police Department said in a statement. "All other hostages were released unharmed."
Reports said the hostages numbered as many as 15.
For several hours, the man refused to surrender and FBI agents were in contact with the gunman in an effort to get him to put down his weapon and exit the building, Grennes said.
Around 4:30 pm (2130 GMT), police heard gunshots inside the building. Three members of a SWAT team in armor and helmets then forced their way inside, breaking through a first-floor window by climbing up a tactical truck, the Post-Tribune said, adding that the two loud pops of flash grenades sounded.
Nearby schools had been in "modified lockdown" in response to the incident, the Times of Northwest Indiana reported. Nearby businesses were also told to evacuate as a precaution.
Police said the area has since been cleared.
