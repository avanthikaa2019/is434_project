BEIJING - The United States should "take necesssary measures" to prevent a repeat of the Chen Guangcheng incident, China said Monday, after a diplomatic row with Washington.
Beijing last week demanded that the United States apologise for sheltering the blind activist, who fled house arrest last month for the US embassy, where he spent six days.
"The US side should draw a lesson from the relevant incident with a responsible attitude, reflect on its policies and moves and take necessary measures to prevent similar incidents," said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei.
Chen's flight from under the noses of dozens of guards made headlines around the world and embarrassed the Chinese government, which has accused Washington of interfering in its affairs.
The activist left the US embassy shortly after the arrival of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Beijing last week for key talks with Chinese leaders, after China said he could move to a "safe" location.
But after speaking to friends and family, he said he did not feel safe in China, and wanted to go to the United States to study.
Washington said on Friday China had indicated it would allow him to travel, but it remains unclear when that might happen and whether he would be allowed to return to China.
