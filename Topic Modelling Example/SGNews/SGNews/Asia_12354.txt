JAKARTA - National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) chief Vice Marshal Daryatmo has announced that the agency has ended the search for the flight-data recorder (FDR) from the Sukhoi Superjet 100 that crashed earlier this month.
"We found nothing significant recently even though we have added three extra days to scour larger areas around the crash site," Daryatmo told reporters at Cijeruk command post in Bogor, West Java, on Monday.
A Russian team has also ordered their personnel to leave Mt. Salak.
Based on Government Regulation No. 36/2006, the Indonesian rescue team could have stopped the search operation after seven days, but the team had continued their operation.
Daryatmo said that all personnel had been withdrawn from the crash site.
He said that the team decided to stop the search since the National Police Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) unit managed to identify all 45 passengers killed in the crash.
Daryatmo said the team decided to stop the search despite not having such a significant part of the black box.
Last week, the team had retrieved part of the black box, believed to be the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) that records the pilot's conversations.
Meanwhile, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), Oni Suryowibowo, said that staff have been working on the available data, Antara news agency reported.
The National Police announced on Sunday that all 45 people on board the Sukhoi Superjet 100, which crashed on May 9, had been identified.
The Russian-made aircraft crashed into the hills of Mt. Salak in West Java while on a demonstration flight.
The officials will hand over the victims' remains to their relatives in an official ceremony on Wednesday at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta.
