Asian acts were among the top money-spinners last year, with five of them making it to the list of the Top 10 concerts staged here last year, in terms of ticket sales.
Of the five, three were Korean pop acts dominated by dancing hunks and leggy lasses, such as Super Junior and Girls' Generation.
The list was provided to my paper by the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore yesterday. A spokesman clarified that the list is only an indicative one derived from ticket-sales figures, and not in order of ranking, due to confidentiality agreements.
Yesterday, my paper reported that concert ticket sales hit an all-time high in Singapore last year, with an estimated $68 million in revenue, a $26-million spike compared to 2010's $42 million.
Touted as one of the biggest Korean pop concerts here last year, the Korean Music Wave 2011 staged in July saw about 7,000 fans in attendance.
The 31/2-hour concert boasted 10 acts and was headlined by Korean record label YG Entertainment's two hottest-selling acts, Big Bang and 2NE1.
In terms of audience size, it was outdone by the concerts staged by Korean acts Super Junior and Girls' Generation.
Both bands played to a sell-out crowd of over 6,000 fans at the Singapore Indoor Stadium for each of the two nights they staged.
But the title for being the biggest crowd-puller last year went to Hong Kong Heavenly King Jacky Cheung, who performed here in August for five consecutive nights.
Tickets of between $98 and $228 for all nights were sold out.
Only three nights were initially planned for the Singapore leg of his Jacky Cheung 1/2 Century Tour, but concert organiser Unusual Productions decided to put up two more shows due to overwhelming response.
He is believed to be the first artist to have held five consecutive shows here.
Cheung also set similar records during the Shanghai and Guangzhou legs of his tour.
