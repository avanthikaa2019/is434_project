Guangzhou police have set up a task force to investigate the death of a foreign resident who collapsed after fighting with a motorbike taxi driver.
"We will investigate the case to the fullest and promise to make our findings public," a police officer in the city's Yuexiu district said on Tuesday.
Authorities have not released the identity of the foreign man.
According to Guangzhou's public security bureau, the man had taken a motorbike taxi to Shanxi Plaza in Sanyuanli Dadao at about 1 pm on Monday. Upon arrival, he argued with the driver, identified only as Sun, about the fare. The two began fighting in the street.
Police arrived and took both men to the nearby Kuangquan police substation for questioning.
There, police said, the foreign man fainted and fell to the ground at about 5 pm. Emergency medical services called to the station were unable to revive him.
The cause of death has yet to be determined, police said, adding that medical experts who examined the body found no wounds.
On Tuesday at 3 pm, traffic on the busy Guangyuanxi Lu was brought to a standstill when a group of foreigners gathered in front of the Kuangquan police substation, seeking an explanation for his death.
The group dispersed after talking with police, and traffic returned to normal at about 5 pm, according to the public security bureau.
The area around Guangyuanxi Lu has many foreign residents. Most are from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa.
