KUALA LUMPUR - A businessman Datuk is being investigated for negligence by police after his RM500,000 (S$204,000) Porsche Cayenne was stolen along with two magazines of ammunition for his Sig Sauer semi-automatic pistol. The Datuk and his company's general manager went to the Bintang Palace karaoke in Jalan Imbi at 12.30am on Tuesday. When they arrived at the premises, the Porsche Cayenne was handed to a car jockey to park.
It is understood that the businessman had left several important documents inside the vehicle and two magazines containing 10 and 12 bullets, respectively.
At 1.55am, the car jockey entered the private karaoke room where the Datuk and the general manager were relaxing and informed them that the Porsche Cayenne had been stolen.
Frantic, the Datuk immediately notified the police and an all-points bulletin was issued on the vehicle and registration number. At 4am, police received a tip-off that the car had been spotted.
A team was dispatched to a hotel along Jalan Sultan Ismail where the Porsche Cayenne had been abandoned. Checks revealed that the documents and ammunition were missing.
A police forensics unit team checked the vehicle thoroughly and also dusted it for fingerprints. A K-9 unit was also sent to the scene but failed to unearth any leads or scents.
City Criminal Investigation Department chief Datuk Ku Chin Wah confirmed the case when contacted by the New Straits Times saying it was being investigated under Section 379 of the Penal Code for theft and Section 3 of the Firearms Act 1960.
It is understood that the Datuk, who is licensed to carry a firearm, is also being probed for negligence as proper procedures stipulate that the firearm and ammunition should be in the possession of the holder.
