The body of a Myanmar national who fell overboard a boat on Tuesday has been found.
Nr Maung Zaw Myo Win, 32, was last seen on Tuesday at 7am.
Search and rescue operations began on the same day but his body was recovered only at 7.45am on Thursday, reported The Straits Times
Mr Zaw was last seen in the water shouting for help by another boat's crew member at around 8am. By the time he alerted Mr Zaw's fellow crew members, he was nowhere to be seen.
The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) was alerted at 8.30am that Mr Zaw, an employee of Everlast Marine Services, was missing from the boat.
Mr Zaw worked on board the harbour craft, which ferries people to bigger ships and to Singapore's southern islands, such as St John's Island.
According to Mr Mark June Lazo, 28, who works on the same boat as Mr Zaw, the latter fell off the boat while he was bathing. His clothes, towel and mobile phone were found near the area where he was believed to be bathing.
Mr Lazo said Mr Zaw worked with Everlast Marine Services for four years and understands Mr Zaw planned to return to Myanmar this year.
Colleagues told The Straits Times that Mr Zaw could not swim.
Mr Zaw's body is now with the Police Coast guard, and the incident is being investigated.
