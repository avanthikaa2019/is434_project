JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he wants Israel's coming general election to be held on September 4, more than a year ahead of schedule.
"We are proposing September 4, and afterward, if God's willing, the voters will give us a mandate," he told his cabinet in remarks released by the prime minister's office.
On Sunday, Netanyahu said in a speech to a convention of his right-wing Likud party that he would seek an early vote in four months' time but did not disclose an exact date.
