A cool $250,000 has been raised by the 28 corporate donors taking part in Football With A Heart, Singapore's first executive football charity fund-raiser.
The project - essentially a five-a-side football tournament - was jointly launched by Singapore Pools, the Singapore Recreation Club (SRC) and Football Association of Singapore (FAS) on June 18.
The tournament and a carnival will be held at the Padang on Aug 25 and President Tony Tan, the patron, will be the guest-of-honour .
Addressing the donors at the programme's media launch, Singapore Pools CEO Tan Soo Nan said: "The target was to get 28 corporate teams, and if possible, bring in new names and not only the traditional, loyal supporters of Singapore football like Tiger Beer and StarHub.
"We also wanted to raise $250,000 for our charities. We reached both targets, and I thank you all for your support." Minister of State for Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck, one of the main drivers of the project and the guest of honour at yesterday's launch, said: "I'm motivated by the fact that it can contribute to a good cause, and also by my passion for football and sports in general. Plus, it meets the Vision 2030 objective of bringing the community together.
"I hope Football With A Heart will be for the long term, and I'm looking forward to playing my part in doing something for the less-privileged."
Mr Teo will lead a Parliamentary team in an exhibition match against a side of personalities from business agencies on Aug 25.
The sum that has been collected will go to six charities that help youth at risk, persons with special needs and the aged sick.
They are Apex Harmony Lodge, Bo Tien Welfare Services Society, CARE United, Jamiyah Children's Home, the President's Challenge 2012 and Ren Ci Hospital.
The five key corporate donors to Football With A Heart are Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore, NETS, POSB, the Singapore Sports Council and StarHub.
