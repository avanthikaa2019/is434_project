She made it to the top 10 of the Global Indian Festival (GIF) 2012 Model Search.
But Miss Presana Narayanan, a 31-year-old of Malayalee ethnicity, was kicked out of the competition for allegedly making racist remarks about Malaysia's Tamil community.
Malayalees are people from the Indian state of Kerala which borders Tamil Nadu.
Miss Narayanan's comments, which were posted on her Facebook page, angered a large section of the Malaysian Tamil community, Malay Mail reported.
The Tamils, in turn, started an "Anti Presana Narayanan" Facebook page. At last count, there were over 8,800 people rallying against her. She has since deleted her Facebook account.
Over the last two days, two police reports had been lodged against her, the complainants urging police to arrest her over the seditious remarks. They are also demanding she apologise for her comments.
The contest organisers have confirmed that Miss Narayanan was out of the event, which was held on Saturday.
Mr Sree Anandan, GIF business development manager, said they called for an immediate meeting upon learning of the incident and decided to boot her out of the contest.
He told Malay Mail: "The person we're looking for has to represent the global Indian community. We don't practise racial discrimination and she has definitely failed to live up to our criteria."
A contest spokesman added: "We regret that she doesn't fit our criteria because of her racist remarks. We hope this is a lesson for other contestants.
"We emphasise (the importance of) inner beauty, character and mindset."
