Actor Kamal Adli admitted he had received a text message saying he will be sued for not attending the preview of the movie Aku Ada Kau Ada? last month.
However, he denied that the sender was Metrowealth (MIG) chief executive officer David Teo, adding that it was from an officer in the company.
"I did not receive any message from David," Kamal was reported as saying in Berita Harian.
The actor, who had made four films under the company's banner, was in Jakarta to promote another film during the preview.
