It was a bad romance, all right.
US pop star Lady Gaga has chosen work over love, dumping US actor Taylor Kinney to focus more on her career.
The 26-year-old was first linked to Kinney, 30, in July last year, after he was featured in the music video for her song You And I.
A source told Us Weekly: "She will be touring non-stop until next year and has found she can't have a relationship at the same time.
"There's just no room for anything else. Her work is all-consuming."
The source added that Kinney was completely self-centred and "didn't completely get Gaga".
