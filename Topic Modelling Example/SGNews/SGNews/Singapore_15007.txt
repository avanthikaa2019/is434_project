The Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) yesterday put out an alert on Asian Fair Trade Advisory Group, a company that claims to help consumers to get money back from timeshare contracts.
It added that the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore has suspended advertisements by the group.
Case advised consumers to verify any firm's claims of being able to dispose of timeshare memberships at good rates, before accepting offers.
