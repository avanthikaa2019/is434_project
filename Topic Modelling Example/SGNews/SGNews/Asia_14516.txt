INDONESIA - Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan has called on authorities to appeal the light sentences handed down to four people who killed orangutans.
The minister said on Sunday that orangutan killers could be sentenced to up to five years in jail.
However, the Tenggarong District Court in Kutai Kartanegara, East Kalimantan, last week sentenced four people to eight months' imprisonment each and fines ranging from Rp 20 million (S$2,740) to Rp 30 million instead.
The four were employees of PT Khaleda Agroprima Malindo, a branch of the Malaysia-based Metro Kajang Holdings Bhd, and had been charged with capturing and killing orangutans at a palm plantation.
"I think the eight-month prison term handed down to each defendant was simply too light. We will ask the prosecutors to appeal the sentences," the minister said, as quoted by kompas.com.
Khaleda senior manager Phuah Chuan and division head Widiantoro were sentenced to eight months' imprisonment and each handed a Rp 30 million fine.
Meanwhile, two lower-rank employees, Imam and Mujianto, were sentenced to eight month's imprisonment and a handed a Rp 20 million fine.
Prosecutors had requested one year's jail per offender.
Earlier this month, activists from the Center for Orangutan Protection (COP) urged the Attorney General's Office (AGO) to investigate the "light charges".
They claimed that the defendants should be sentenced up to five years' in jail with Rp 100 million fines, based on the 1990 Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystems Law.
