Peter Georg Heimerl, 54, and his Thai wife Piyanuch Unnahawiriya, 48, collected a bag containing the cash, Heimerl's German passport, eyeglasses and house keys, which he'd dropped in Charoenchai's taxi on Monday afternoon.
Heimerl had taken the cab from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Soi Khajornwit in Samut Prakan's Bang Phli district.
The couple thanked Charoenchai and rewarded him with Bt3,000 (S$122).
The cabbie said he noticed the bag under the passenger's seat the next day and spotted the bundle of cash inside.
He said he decided to turn the bag in at the radio station because it wasn't his. The radio station then helped locate the owner.
