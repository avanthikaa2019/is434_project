The stress of everyday life is driving Singaporean men aged between 30 and 40 to pay young girls to have sex with them, Sin Chew Daily reported.
The daily quoted psychologist Dr Yang Jia Le as saying it was not difficult for men younger than 30 to befriend and pick up underage girls at nightclubs but this is not the case with older men.
"Therefore, they (the older men) need another solution to fulfil their needs.
"The matured men, unlike the younger ones, are financially capable of paying for sex with underage girls," said Dr Yang from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, adding that the girls could ask at least S$500 (RM1,228) a session.
Recently, 48 men aged 21 to 49 were charged with having paid sex with girls below 18 years.
Thirty of the men were in the 30 to 40 age group.
