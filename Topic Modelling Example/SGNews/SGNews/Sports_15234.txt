KUALA LUMPUR - Play was suspended midway through the Maybank Malaysian Open's second round in case of lightning after storm clouds gathered over the event at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club Friday.
South Africans Otto Hennie and Jbe Kruger held the clubhouse lead with nine-under-par totals of 135, with compatriot Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open winner, one shot back through 12 holes.
Oosthuizen continued his stirring return from last weekend's play-off loss at the US Masters to lie two under par in his unfinished second round.
But playing partner Charl Schwartzel, the overnight leader, gave up three shots to slip back to a share of provisional 12th place as the hooter sounded just after 4:00 pm (0800 GMT).
Tournament organisers were monitoring the weather in the hope of resuming the second round later on Friday, an official said.
