A diver who was cleaning the hull of a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) was reported missing to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) at about 2.55pm on Saturday.
The diver, from CuTech Marine Services, was working on the VLCC "KOKKARI" that was anchored 4km southeast of Marina South Pier.
As investigations are currently ongoing, CuTech Marine Services is unable to the identity of the young diver, said to be a foreigner.
According to standard protocol, divers are supposed to resurface every 40 minutes. When he did not appear, standby divers were activated, said Mr Bala, a spokesman from CuTech Marine Services.
MPA was notified when the standby divers were unable to locate the missing person.
A search and rescue operation coordinated by MPA, involving two MPA and one Police Coast Guard (PCG) craft, has been launched.
The MPA has issued navigational broadcasts to vessels in the vicinity to keep clear of the search and rescue area, and to report any sighting of the missing person.
PCG is investigating the incident.
