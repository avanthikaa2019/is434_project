SINGAPORE - While sales of DVD players and recorders have been faltering of late, Southeast Asia has registered a thriving Blu-ray market.
In the first three months of 2012, the Blu-ray market expanded by 51 per cent in sales volume in the region.
Overall, the consumer electronics markets in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam have registered a slight volume growth of two per cent in the first quarter of 2012.
This growth was driven largely by heightened sales in LED TVs as well as the proliferation of Blu-ray technology across all markets.
Mr. Gerard Tan, Account Director for Digital Technology at GfK Asia said the declining price of the Blu-ray players has fueled the surge in sales, which is boosted correspondingly along with the rise of HDTV adoption, since HD video players are needed to complete the viewing experience.
Major manufacturers of video players are also jumping on the bandwagon. There are now more than 20 local and international manufacturers to date, offering a total of 118 models of Blu-ray players, many of which come equipped with new and innovative features.
"The declining prices of Blu-ray players is fueling the surge in sales, which is also boosted correspondingly along with the rise of HDTV adoption since high definition video players are necessary to achieve the complete viewing experience," said Mr Tan. Smart Blu-ray players allow consumers to view Internet content directly on normal TVs.
With the latest developments in the market, the industry is gearing itself up for long term growth as manufacturers continue to enhance their offerings to sustain the interests of consumers.
