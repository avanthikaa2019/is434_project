Spanish furniture maker OHEA has introduced an electronic bed that makes itself.
The Smart Bed is equipped with two mechanical arms and a roller that move the blanket back to the head of the bed in a process that takes only about 50 seconds.
When the user flips a switch positioned at the foot of the bed, the bed senses the body movement and makes itself three seconds later.
The furniture also contains a built-in safety device that prevents operation while a person is lying on the mattress.
OHEA has not yet announced the release date or price for the Smart Bed.
