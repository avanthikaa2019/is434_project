A team of scientists here have come up with a microchip that can transfer data wirelessly more than 1,000 times faster than Bluetooth.
The chip can be used in mobile devices such as smartphones to transfer movies and songs in seconds.
A two-hour movie, for example, would take just 30 seconds to transfer between phones with the chip.
The work of the team - from Nanyang Technological University and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Institute of Infocomm Research - has received 16 international patents .
Their work has also been featured in 51 science journals and conference papers.
