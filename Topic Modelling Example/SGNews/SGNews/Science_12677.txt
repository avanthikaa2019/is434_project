A recent survey has revealed an upward struggle for Facebook's advertising programme, independent digital marketing agency Greenlight said.
44 per cent of respondents in the global survey said they would 'never' click on a Facebook sponsored ads while 30 per cent 'strongly distrust' the social network with their personal data.
Facebook ranked as the third most popular website (after Google and YouTube) when asked 'How regularly do you use the following websites/services?'.
It ranked second when asked 'Which of the following do you use on your mobile phone?', with roughly 30 per cent of those surveyed saying they use Facebook on their mobiles and tablets.
50 per cent of respondents to Greenlight's survey said they use Facebook for social engagement, sharing photos, and catching up with friends and family.
&ldquo;Facebook's popularity doesn't come as a surprise. However, with over 30% of respondents saying they 'strongly distrust' Facebook with their personal data, Facebook's advertising programme has an upward struggle,&rdquo; says Hannah Kimuyu, director of paid media at Greenlight.
&ldquo;Facebook's advertising programme allows brands to connect with more than 800 million potential customers, through targeting their age, gender, location and interests, in other words - personal data.&rdquo;
Kimuyu adds, &ldquo;Although 44% say they would 'never' click on advertisements or sponsored listings in Facebook, it is interesting to see that those who do find the targeting effective and engaging.
