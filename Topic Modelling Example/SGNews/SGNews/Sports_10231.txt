SINGAPORE - Team Singapore won the gold medal for its Team Free routine at the synchronised swimming segment on the second day of the synchronised swimming events at the SEA Swimming Championships 2012 tonight.
The evening's Team Free event required no predetermined elements to be executed and therefore highlighted the best in a team's creativity, innovation and strength in the water. Team Singapore did just that, scoring an impressive 35.53 in the technical merit and 36.40 in artistic impression, with a combined score of 71.93.
Meanwhile, Malaysia's Zylane Lee, three-time gold medallist at the 2011 SEA Games won the Free Solo routine with a score of 70.63.
"Immediately after Crystal Lee's routine, I was a bit nervous, she did well but I was very happy with my win, I was lucky I guess," said the 20-year-old Zylane Lee.
Zylane narrowly secured her win with a very close margin of 0.55 points, in front of closest contender, Singapore's Crystal Yap (70.08), silver medallist at last year's SEA Games.
"I felt a bit sad, but I guess this is an opportunity for me to work harder next time," said Crystal Yap, silver medallist in the Solo Free routine.
Huynh Minh Trang of Vietnam completes the podium for Solo Free with her bronze, while Vietnam and Myanmar take second and third for the team competition respectively.
The last day of synchronised swimming action continues on Sunday with the Duet Free and Team Free Combination at the Toa Payoh Swimming Complex. Tickets are available at the door at $5.00 each.
