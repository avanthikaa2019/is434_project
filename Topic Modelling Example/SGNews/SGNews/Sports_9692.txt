The Portuguese Football Federation is facing disciplinary action after a fan tried to get on the pitch during the country's Euro 2012 quarter-final win against the Czech Republic, UEFA said on Saturday.
European football's governing body said in an emailed statement that they had launched proceedings against the FPF for "the inappropriate behaviour of their supporters -- attempted invasion of the field of play by a fan".
The case will be heard on Monday, it added.
Portugal won Thursday's match at the National Stadium in Warsaw 1-0 with a Cristiano Ronaldo goal. They play the winners of Saturday's quarter-final between title holders Spain and France in the first semi-final next Wednesday.
