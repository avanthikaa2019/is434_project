Last year, the number of incidents that caused service delays of over five minutes per 100,000km travelled by a train in operation was 5.1 for Bukit Panjang LRT, the highest for any train line here.
The lowest was for the North East Line at 1.
A lower incident rate indicates a more reliable service level.
