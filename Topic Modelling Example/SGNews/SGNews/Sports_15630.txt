Indonesian Davis Cup team turned the tables by defeating archrival Thailand 3-2 after young player Wisnu Adi Nugroho won the last match against Kittipong Wachiramanowong on their final day of Davis Cup Asian Zone Group II semifinal matches on Sunday.
The win was Indonesia's first since having been consistently beaten by Thailand in four out of six previous meetings kompas.com reported on Sunday.
Wisnu, who replaced Aditya Hari Sasongko, defeated the Thai player in straight sets 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 at the Tennis Stadium in the Gelora Bung Karno sports complex in Senayan, Central Jakarta.
Earlier, the team's number one player, Christopher Rungkat, overtook Danai Udomchoke in a dramatic five-set victory 6-3, 6-2, 0-6, 4-6, 6-1.
Heavy rain delayed the match in the fourth set while Udomchoke led 5-4. Christopher lost the fourth set but managed to salvage the match by rebounding in the last set 6-1.
"I already prepared myself to anticipate a long, heavy match against Danai," said Christopher, who defeated the Thai player in men's single final at the 26th SEA Games last year in Palembang, South Sumatra.
Thailand previously led the match 2-1 on Saturday after Thai twins Sonchat Ratiwatana and Sanchai Ratiwatana crushed Christopher and David Agung Susanto 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-1.
The two teams shared 1-1 on their first day when Christopher overpowered Wachiramanowong while Aditya succumbed to Udomchoke.
Indonesia will face the Philippines, who had successfully outdone Pakistan, in September's final match.
