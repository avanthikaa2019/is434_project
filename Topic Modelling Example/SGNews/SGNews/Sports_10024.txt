BEIJING - Former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is set to sign for Shanghai Shenhua, joining Nicolas Anelka at the Chinese club, its chief investor said.
The Ivory Coast international, 34, will announce the move on his personal website, Zhu Jun told the state Xinhua news agency, in a deal that will reportedly put Drogba on 200,000 pounds (S$398,006) a week.
French forward Anelka, who joined Shenhua in January also from Chelsea, has openly said that he wants Drogba to join him at the ambitious Chinese club.
Zhu denied a report in Shanghai's Xinmin Evening News that Drogba, who left Chelsea after helping the English Premier League club to their first Champions League triumph last month, would earn an annual salary of 12.0 million euros (S$19.19 million).
Another Shanghai newspaper, the Oriental Morning Post, said Monday that Shenhua have offered Drogba 200,000 pounds a week.
Deep-pocketed Shenhua have spent lavishly on foreign talent, including coaches. They sacked head coach Jean Tigana earlier this season and replaced him with former Argentina manager Sergio Batista last month.
They are currently 12th in the 16-club Super League.
