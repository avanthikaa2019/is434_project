SINGAPORE - He was involved in a gang clash in 1999 that left one man dead.
The former secret society leader then spent the next 12 years on the run overseas in Malaysia, Thailand and the Netherlands.
But in May 2011, the 51-year-old bachelor was arrested at Changi Airport after returning because he missed his home and family.
Chan Heng Kee was sentenced seven years by a district court on Thursday. He had pleaded guilty in March to voluntarily causing grievous hurt and causing hurt with a dangerous weapon.
He and his accomplices had attacked three men believed to have been members of a rival secret society. One of them, Devadas Paneerselum, 29, later died.
A fight had broken out at 3.30am on Oct 22, 1999, after the Devadas and two friends quarrelled with a member of Chan's gang. The trio repeatedly shouted out the name of a secret society.
Chan, together with five or six accomplices, then charged at Devadas and his friends, repeatedly shouting their secret society slogan. Chan was armed with a knife.
Devadas was stabbed in the thigh and lost a large amount of blood. His friends were also injured.
Chan got rid of the knife in a dustbin after he heard police were on their way and fled in a taxi with an accomplice called Teo Boon Yam.
Devadas was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital but died of his injuries shortly afterwards.
Chan left Singapore at 7am that same morning and stayed overseas until his arrest in 2011.
Teo was sentenced in 2001 to five years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane after being convicted of similar charges.
