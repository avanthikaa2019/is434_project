Three men were arrested this week for suspected involvement in loansharking activities.
Two suspects, aged 19 and 20, were nabbed in the vicinity of Hougang Street 61 on Thursday.
Loan shark-related items such as ATM cards, bank transaction receipts, more than $1,300 cash and mobile phones with suspected debtors' records were found on them.
Another man, aged 33, was arrested on Friday after the police were alerted to a case of loan shark harassment, in which the door of a HDB flat at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 was splashed with paint.
