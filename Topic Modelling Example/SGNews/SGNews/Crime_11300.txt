PARIS - Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel insisted Monday at the start of his appeal hearing on Monday that he was not responsible for the five billion euros his gambles lost leading French bank Societe Generale.
"I am not responsible for this loss and the acts I am accused of. I always acted with the knowledge of my hierarchy," he told the judge when asked why he was appealing his 2010 conviction.
The 35-year-old Frenchman was originally sentenced to five years in jail with two years suspended for breach of trust, forgery and entering false data into computers during the 2008 covert stock market deals.
The original verdict also required him to pay back the staggering 4.9 billion euros (S$7.9 billion) his market gambles cost Societe Generale.
But critics said the ruling made him a scapegoat for a banking system based on pure greed.
