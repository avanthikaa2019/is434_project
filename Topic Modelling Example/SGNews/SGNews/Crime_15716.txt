KUALA LUMPUR - A man died from a gunshot wound and the police found no other evidence except the bullet. Now, will this be enough to find the killer?
Just like the way they do it on television, the Royal Malaysian Police used science to catch the killer in this 2011 murder case.
Ballistics technology has come a long way and within an hour of searching on IBIS, the authorities found the killer.
When detectives first looked at the body of the man found in Selangor, they had no idea that this was only the latest in a series of murders spanning three states.
Senior Asst Comm Dr Yew Chong Hooi said that usually the three cases would have been investigated separately, adding that this probably would have led nowhere.
"The murders in Perak, Johor and Selangor had no real connection between them. But when we put the bullets' information into IBIS, the system linked all three cases because the murders were committed with the same gun," he said.
He said most of the time, a bullet was only compared to an average of 10 samples, which meant that ultimately, many criminals were able to elude the law.
"When we got a bullet from a crime scene, we couldn't check it with every sample in our database as this would take forever," he said.
"So, we had to rely on things like clues from the investigating detective to point us in the right direction or if we recognised an unusual marking on the bullet from another case."
However, thanks to IBIS, SAC Dr Yew said this was but a thing of the past.
"With IBIS' help, we arrested two men for the murders. I am confident that this system will go a long way towards helping the police fight gun-related crimes in the country," he said.
