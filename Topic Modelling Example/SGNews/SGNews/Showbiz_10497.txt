PETALING JAYA - Catch Carlsberg managing director Soren Ravn rapping on the Football Every Day Euro 2012 webcast today.
Ravn, who is a die-hard Denmark fan, was in a jovial mood as he bantered with the Football Every Day crew of Zack Yusof, Brian Martin and Shaun Orange during the recording.
His country made a great start in Euro 2012 when Denmark beat Holland 1-0 on June 9.
"I feel that this Euro 2012 is great for all Danes around the world.
"Usually, the Danes would not perform well in the group matches in the past European Championships but it is different this year.
"With such a good start, I firmly believe that the Danish team would qualify for the quarterfinals this year and maybe the finals.
"Denmark has great strikers and midfielders and even a world-class goalkeeper in Stephan Andersen. This is a well-rounded team and it is just a joy to see the Danish squad play,'' said Ravn.
At the end of the webcast, Zack was beatboxing while Ravn did a freestyle rap.
Carlsberg is the beer sponsor for Euro 2012. The company has lined up more than 1,000 activities in various locations throughout the country and is giving a chance to 100 Malaysians to watch the Euro 2012 semi-finals live.
