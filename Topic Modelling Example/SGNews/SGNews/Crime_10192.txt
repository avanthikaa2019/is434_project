KUCHING, Malaysia - Sarawak police rescued a three-month-old baby girl from being sold for RM17,000 to a baby-for-sale syndicate here yesterday.
The syndicate was uncovered after police questioned a 51-year-old local man who was in possession of an Indonesian passport at a coffee shop at MJC Batu Kawa township.
Suspecting that the man was a middleman for a human trafficking syndicate, police raided a nearby snooker centre at 6.30am.
In the raid, a police team from the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Unit and the Vice, Gambling and Secret Societies Unit found three local women aged between 19 and 28, and the baby.
The team then raided an apartment on the third floor of the same building where they found the baby's 27-year-old Indonesian mother.
State Criminal Investigation Department chief Datuk Zulkifli Hassan said initial investigations revealed that the mother sought the help of the middleman to sell her baby for RM17,000 (S$6,959).
All the suspects were taken to the state police headquarters for further investigations and remanded for attempting to sell the baby while the baby was sent to the Sarawak Hospital for a medical check-up.
State police commissioner Datuk Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani said they were investigating the extent of the syndicate's activities in the state, and whether it extended beyond Sarawak.
