WASHINGTON - US seismologists issued an Indian Ocean-wide tsunami watch following a massive earthquake off the coast of Sumatra Wednesday but said it appeared to have only generated small waves.
The 8.6-magnitude earthquake was followed by a massive aftershock, measuring 8.2, off the Indonesian island, raising a new tsunami threat.
Victor Sardina, a geophysicist with the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, told AFP the first tsunami was &ldquo;not anywhere near&rdquo; as large as the devastating waves that struck Asia in 2004 and Japan last year.
He said the tsunami measured a mere 35cm near Padang, Indonesia, but could swell to as high as a meter near Sri Lanka, adding that US scientists were still carefully monitoring the situation.
Earlier, the center said &ldquo;earthquakes of this size have the potential to generate a widespread destructive tsunami.&rdquo;
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in a bulletin after the quake added that &ldquo;sea level readings indicate a tsunami was generated. It may already have been destructive along some coasts.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Based on these data the threat continues for all coastal areas of the Indian Ocean,&rdquo; the Hawaii based center said.
The first quake struck at 2:38 pm (0838 GMT, 4.38pm Singapore time) at a depth of 33km with its epicenter some 435km from Banda Aceh.
The US Geological Survey said the aftershock struck at 10:43 GMT, 615km from Banda Aceh.
The area was one of the hardest-hit from the December 26, 2004 quake and subsequent tsunami that wrought devastation across the Indian Ocean and killed some 220,000 people.
The earthquake that caused the 2004 tsunami had a magnitude of 9.2, but also a much stronger vertical component, whereas Wednesday's earthquake was more horizontally directed, Sardina said.
Last year, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami off northeastern Japan, killing some 19,000 people and sparking a nuclear disaster after an atomic power plant was swamped by the wave.
