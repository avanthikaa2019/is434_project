Six Internet cafes were sealed by Kuala Lumpur City Hall in the first three months of the year for acting as fronts for gambling.
Deputy Federal Territories and Urban Wellbeing Minister Datuk M. Saravanan said more than 100 computers were seized in the raids.
"This is part of our efforts to prevent vice activities such as prostitution, gambling and illegal massage parlours from mushrooming in the capital. The situation is under control."
He was replying to Senator Chiew Lian Keng who asked why vice activities had continued despite raids by the authorities.
Saravanan said one way of ensuring the operators did not resume their business was to organise more raids with better intelligence.
"We have identified hot spots where such activities flourished and we are focusing our raids there."
He said 123 premises were sealed last year and almost 3,000 computers used in Internet gambling were seized.
Saravanan said the main enforcement agency that tackled prostitution and gambling was the police.
"But City Hall frequently participates in these raids."
He said City Hall sometimes organised raids and invited the police, Immigration and Rela personnel to participate.
