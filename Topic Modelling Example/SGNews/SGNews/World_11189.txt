OSLO - An Oslo court said Tuesday it expected to hand down its verdict in the trial of Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway last year, on July 20 or August 24.
"It is not yet known on what date (the) judgment will be given, but it cannot be expected sooner than July 20. Another possible date for the judgment is August 24," the court said on its website.
Without excluding other dates, court spokesman Markus Iestra told AFP that the court was actively working to ensure that the verdict would fall on either July 20 or August 24.
Until now, rumour in the court corridors had it that the verdict would fall on July 20, two days before the one-year anniversary of Breivik's twin attacks.
Breivik's trial began on April 16 and is set to last until June 22.
