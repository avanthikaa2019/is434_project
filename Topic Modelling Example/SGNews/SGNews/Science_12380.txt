Content strategist Agnes Goh of local charity Focus on the Family Singapore has seven tips for parents on the use of gadgets when raising their children:
Early exposure to gadgets may create addictive patterns of behaviour that may stunt holistic development.
This is especially important as more gadgets now come with Internet access.
Family mealtimes should be gadget-free so that children can have meaningful person-to-person interaction with their family members.
This move can reinforce the notion that such endeavours as learning and reading are necessary evils to be endured rather than rewards by themselves.
Gadgets cannot replace parents in meeting children's needs.
Not all apps are harmful to children. There are apps which are educational and beneficial to a child's development.
Adults caught up with gadgets are not setting a good example for their children.
