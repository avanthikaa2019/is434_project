International model Lisa S is coming to town to personally handpick the Season 4 contestants of reality show Supermodelme.
She will be choosing the contestants during the Audi Fashion Festival (AFF), marking the show's collaboration with the event for its fourth season.
She says, "With a platform like the Audi Fashion Festival, I'm sure there will be plenty of talented girls to choose from and I'm really looking forward to it!"
The call for entries will expand to Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Vietnam, Singapore, Philippines and China. Season 4 has greater appeal as it promises an increased cash prize of $35,000 from the previous amount of $20,000, as well as a highly sought-after contract with top international agencies in both Europe and Asia.
The top 3 contestants of season 4 will be given the exclusive opportunity to walk the runways AFF 2013, exposing them to a 'live' audience and international fashion experts.
Ms. Tjin Lee, Managing Director of Mercury Marketing &amp; Communications - the organizers of AFF - says, "The partnership with Supermodelme ties in beautifully with our goals for AFF, which are to show support for home-grown initiatives and talents and create high-level opportunities for emerging stakeholders in Asia's fashion scene."
Lisa S will be joined by resident judges, actress and supermodel Ase Wang and ELLE Singapore's Editor-in-chief, Sharon Lim in the show's new partnership with AFF.
