An enhanced emergency preparedness (EP) scheme called EP123Plus! was launched yesterday by the People's Association to build networks of trust among different segments of the community.
It also incorporates elements promoting racial understanding and social cohesion.
The Community Emergency and Engagement Council aims to engage 80,000 residents as part of its target to have one in three households EP-ready by 2015.
