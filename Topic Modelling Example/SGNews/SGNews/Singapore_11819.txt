SINGAPORE - Residents walking by Bishan Street 23 may have thought they walked into a movie set on Monday evening.
An SBS Transit bus service 162 lay static at the side off the road cordoned off, as Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers fully suited in hazardous material (HazMat) suits combed the entire length of the bus.
A police spokesperson said they received a call at about 6.20pm that a suspicious object had been found on the bus.
The HazMat team was immediately dispatched to the scene, and when the item was found, the passengers were ordered to alight from the bus.
Ms Priscilla Tan, 43, a housewife on her evening jog, told The New Paper that the scene resembled "something from a movie."
"It was like some alien invasion," she said.
She added that the area was crowded with onlookers, but none she asked had any clue as to what happened.
It is not clear what made the driver stop the vehicle or who alerted the police.
Mr Patrick Chin, who was on his way home from work, said that the officers were checking something under the seats. TNP reported that it is a white powder.
The team conducted tests on the object using detectors, but did not find any positive readings.
At 11pm, the bus was allowed to drive off.
Police assured members of the public that it was no threat or danger to them.
