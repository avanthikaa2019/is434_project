A dramatic scene unfolded at Block 327 Hougang Ave 5 when a woman hurled her personal belongings from her eighth-storey flat.
According to The Straits Times, the 61-year-old is a former patient at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
She also threatened suicide, prompting police and officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to inflate anti-suicide air bags in front of and behind the block.
For several hours, she flung items such as clothes and papers onto the field in front of the block. An eyewitness said the woman also opened the window sporadically and waved her arms, and shouted in Cantonese.
The incident began at about 11am, and continued for five hours.
The New Paper reported that hundreds of curious bystanders were watching the drama as it unfolded.
An eyewitness told The New Paper that a passer-by and his son were almost hit by some of the items flung from the flat.
SCDF personnel climbed onto the ledge below the woman's flat after she refused to let them into her flat.
When they could not talk her out of jumping, officers forced their way into her house by sawing through the gate and breaking down her door.
As police led her away, she continued threatening to kill herself. Police confirmed that the woman is of unsound mind.
Neighbours said she was an introvert who lived in the flat for more than 20 years. One neighbour said she had been pacing the corridor daily since Monday, talking to herself.
