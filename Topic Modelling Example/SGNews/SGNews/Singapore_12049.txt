Polling for the Hougang by-election began at 8am today.
23,368 Hougang voters are set to vote for a new Member of Parliament for the Hougang Single Member Constituency (Hougang SMC).
The by-election, which was triggered by former Hougang MP Yaw Shin Leong's expulsion from the Workers' Party (WP), is being contested by Mr Desmond Choo, 34, of the People's Action Party (PAP) and Mr Png Eng Huat, 50, of the WP.
Hougang residents will cast their votes in nine polling stations, which will close at 8pm.
Voters in the Hougang by-election are advised to take public transport or where possible, walk to their polling stations as parking is generally not allowed within the premises of polling stations.
The public is also advised to leave after casting their votes and not loiter around the vicinity of the polling stations.
The results for the by-election are expected to be announced before midnight today.
