MANILA, Philippines - Think summer could not possibly get any hotter than it already is? Think again.
Slimmers World International just raised the temperature a couple of degrees with its Miss Bikini Philippines Pageant 2012 held at Diamond Hotel Manila where 24 candidates from Slimmers World branches throughout the country showed off their slim and sexy bodies.
The 24 candidates were selected after a "careful screening process that combed through hundreds of hopefuls across the Philippines," Slimmers World said in a statement.
The candidates stayed for 20 days in Diamond Hotel Manila to prepare for the pageant by undergoing "special training for personality development, modelling, nutrition counselling, and fitness and skin assessments," it said.
"Slimmers World Miss Bikini Philippines advocates the healthy, fit and beautiful lifestyle for every Filipino," it added.
"The extensive measures taken by Slimmers World ensure that all the candidates can stand toe-to-toe with the best the world has to offer in international competition," it said.
The Grand Coronation will be held on April 27, 7 p.m. at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Plenary Hall where one candidate will be crowned as Miss Bikini Philippines and represent the country in Miss Bikini International that will be held in China.
Tickets to the Coronation Night are free. Interested parties may call Slimmers World hotlines at 536-3333 / 525-8771 / 091-SLIMMERS for inquiries.
