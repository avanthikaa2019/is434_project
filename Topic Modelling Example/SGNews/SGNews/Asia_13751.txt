HA NOI, PHILIPPINES - An inflatable liferaft carrying seven tugboat crew - three Indonesians, two Malaysians and two Bangladeshis - has been found drifting in the East Sea by Vietnamese fishermen.
The crew were off the Malaysian-registered tug boat Wantas VI which, they said, was hijacked by pirates.
The Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre of Region 3 was overseeing their transport to hospital to be treated for severe dehydration and sickness after 15 days at sea.
The crew members were expected to arrive in port in Phu Yen Province this morning.
According to Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, the tugboat, towing a barge, departed from Langkawi, Malaysia on April 12 en route to Tawau, Malaysia.
