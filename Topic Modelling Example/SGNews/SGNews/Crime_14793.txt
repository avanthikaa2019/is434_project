SYDNEY - A man was in custody on Thursday after he allegedly kidnapped, handcuffed and repeatedly sexually assaulted a Japanese woman, reportedly a tourist, in Sydney.
Chief Inspector Rick Johnson told reporters the victim, 29, got to know the man after arriving in Australia in January. She travelled around the country and met up with him again on Tuesday.
It was then that her ordeal began.
"The offender made a number of advances to the victim. When she resisted she was detained by some form of bondage method, by tying her up," Johnson told state broadcaster ABC.
Handcuffs were used and the man then allegedly repeatedly sexually assaulted her, a police statement said.
The woman told police she escaped by climbing out of a window when she was untied to use the toilet.
"She was obviously very distressed but very willing to provide police with all the information that they required," Johnson said.
The man, 48, has been charged with three counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of kidnapping.
