Two 16-year-old youths who had stolen a bicycle were arrested following a tip-off from a man.
Four more accomplices, aged 15 to 16 years old, were also arrested.
A 28-year-old man spotted two youths behaving suspiciously at the void deck of Blk 281 Toh Guan Road on May 8 at about 12.20am.
He continued observing them and called the police when he noticed them trying to cut the lock of a bicycle.
The stolen bicycle and a cutter were found on the two suspects when the police arrested them at the scene.
Through follow-up investigations, four more youths were arrested near Boon Lay Way and Clementi Ave 5. Two bicycles, believed to be stolen, were seized.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the six suspects are believed to be involved in at least three cases of bicycle theft near Jurong East and Toh Guan Road housing estates.
Investigations are ongoing.
If convicted, they will face a fine or will be punished with imprisonment for a term of up to three years, or both.
Acting Commander of Clementi Police Division, Superintendant of Police Rosalind Khoo, commended the public-spirited citizen which led to the arrest of the suspects.
She urged bicycle owners to keep their bicycle at home when they are not using it and to lock it up when left unattended even if only for a short while.
Bicycles should be secured to a permanent structure such as a bicycle rack and all bicycle components should preferably be locked or secured.
Owners are advised to use a durable lock such as a U-lock that provides better security compared to cable locks or use a lock with an alarm feature.
If the bicycle needs to be parked at a public place, choose one with high human traffic and is well-lit, preferably with closed-circuit TV monitoring, and make unique permanent identification marks such as engravings or affix the Bicycle Security Label on the body.
