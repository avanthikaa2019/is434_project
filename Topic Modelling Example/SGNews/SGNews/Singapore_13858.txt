A 27-year-old Singaporean changed his name from "Gau Saik" (dog faeces in Hokkein) because he felt embarrassed whenever his name was called in public, Guang Ming Daily reported.
The name was given by his grandparents when he was a baby.
The man said he was teased by his friends, and his teachers "tried not to laugh whenever they called my name", it reported.
To avoid embarrassment, the man gave himself a Christian name.
However, as the Christian name was not part of his official name, his Hokkien name was still called out loudly at clinics and banks.
The man finally managed to change his name by filling a form in the presence of a lawyer and submitting it to the registration department, it reported.
