An Italian man was arrested in Bangkok's Bang Kho Laem district for allegedly making pornographic films, Immigration Police deputy chief Pol Maj-General Warin Boonyakiat told a press conference yesterday.
The suspect denied the charge. Police say their investigation found that 58-year-old Marco Lazzarini was running the porn website perverx.com from a house in Soi Sathupradit 20. Police say they made the arrest after searching Lazzarini's house and finding film-making tools, sex props and a computer.
An initial police investigation found that Lazzarini had visited Thailand four times as tourist, had a Filipino wife, and allegedly used Thailand and the Philippines as a base for making porn films. Police have charged him with violating the Computer Crimes Act, punishable by five years in jail and/or a Bt100,000 fine, and revoked his Thai visa.
