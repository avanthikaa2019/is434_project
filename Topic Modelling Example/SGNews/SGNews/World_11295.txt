JERUSALEM - The Israeli military carried out air strikes on Gaza overnight, injuring one Palestinian, after a rocket was fired at southern Israel, the army and Palestinian medical sources said on Monday.
"Overnight, IAF (Israel Air Force) aircraft targeted a weapons manufacturing facility and a terror tunnel in the northern Gaza Strip. Direct hits were identified," it said.
"The targeting of these sites was in response to the rocket fire on communities in southern Israel," it said, referring to a rocket which hit the Eshkol region along the southern stretch of the Gaza border, without causing injuries or damage.
Palestinian medics said one person was hurt in a raid on northern Gaza City, but it was not clear how serious his injuries were.
Several hours earlier, medics said a young militant injured in an Israeli air strike on Friday had died of his injuries.
Saraqa Kudeh, an 18-year-old militant with the radical Popular Resistance Committees, was badly wounded along with two other PRC militants in a strike near Khan Yunis on Friday afternoon.
One of them already died from his wounds on Friday night.
The strike came after an early morning incident along the border in which a militant managed to cross into southern Israel, sparking a firefight in which the gunman and an Israeli soldier were killed.
Since the start of the year, Palestinian militants have fired more than 270 rockets at southern Israel, according to the Israeli army.
Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, maintains a tacit truce with Israel, but other Palestinian groups in the territory occasionally fire rockets across the border.
