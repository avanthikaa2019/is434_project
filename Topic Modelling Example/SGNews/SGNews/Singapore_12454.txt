SINGAPORE - A 38-year-old cyclist was found dead near Changi Coast Road on Saturday, reported The Straits Times (ST).
The police received a call for help at about 5pm but only found the body in a forested area off the cycling track at 9pm. Paramedics declared the man dead an hour later.
Police have classified the case as unnatural death but no foul play is suspected, according to ST. However, the police have not released details about who he is.
The deceased was believed to have been cycling with a friend, who alerted the police, when he realised "something was amiss", said the report.
Changi Coast Road is a popular trail among cyclists for its shady, straight and uninterrupted cycling path of more than 7km. The route is considered an easy one.
