LONDON - Some 12,500 British officers will be deployed daily during the Olympic Games in the country's largest ever pre-planned policing operation, the Metropolitan force said on Monday.
With 67 days to go until the event begins, police revealed that 52 forces from around Britain will provide officers for the operation, which will run from June 4 until September 16, after the close of the Paralympic Games.
There will be around 12,500 officers on duty during peak days with 9,500 operating in London, according to a statement released by police. Specialist officers trained in search techniques, marine, public order and firearms will be on call along with the mounted sections, dog units and motorcycle escorts.
"Every force is playing its part in delivering a fantastic summer of celebration," said National Olympic Security Coordinator Chris Allison.
"The summer of 2012 will be a busy and challenging time for the British police service, but with confidence and pride I can say we have the officers we need to keep the Games and our wider communities safe and secure," he added.
A security force of more than 40,000 people, backed by a huge intelligence operation, is to guard the Games - which start on July 27 - at a cost of &pound;553 million (S$1.1 billion).
Some 13,500 of the security personnel will be from the Ministry of Defence and armed forces, working alongside police and more than 16,000 private security guards and unpaid volunteers.
Security chiefs are believed to be preparing for a range of threats including a "lone wolf" terrorist, riots or cyber-attacks.
In February, thousands of emergency personnel held a two-day exercise simulating a terror attack on the Underground train network during the Olympics.
