Well-known plastic surgeon, Woffles Wu, will have two charges of instigating an elderly employee to take the blame for him for two speeding offences mentioned next month.
The Straits Times reported that the 52-year-old has been accused of abetting Mr Kuan Yit Wah to provide misleading information to the police in 2005 and 2006.
Mr Kuan alleged lied that he was the driver of a car caught speeding at 95kmh along Lornie Road that has a 70kmh speed limit, in 2005.
He was 76 years old at the time of the incident in Sep 2005.
He was also said to have lied again in Nov 2006 for another speeding offence where the car was travelling at 91kmh along a 70kmh-speed-limit Adam Road.
Both instances involved Wu's car but The Straits Times reported that court papers did not state who the actual driver was.
The case with Wu appearing will be mentioned in court on June 13.
He can face a maximum penalty of $1,000 fine and six months' jail on each charge.
