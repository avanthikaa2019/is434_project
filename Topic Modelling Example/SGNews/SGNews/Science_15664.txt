Russia is developing weapons that can bend minds and put people in a zombie-like state, the Daily Mail reported last Saturday.
Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin has confirmed that his country's scientists are working on guns that emit electromagnetic radiation (EMR). He claims that the new weapons will be "more acceptable in terms of political and military ideology" than nuclear weapons.
A high dosage of EMR is known to be harmful to biological systems. When exposed to humans, it can damage internal organs, induce stress and even effect behavior.
Anatoly Tsyganok of the Military Forecasting Center in Moscow said such a weapon is "highly serious." He said when a man was exposed to concentrated waves, his temperature shot up like he was "thrown into a hot frying pan."
Some are raising concerns that this new weapon that can attack central nervous system might be used against Russia's own people.
According to the British paper, 43-year-old Sergei Serykh said he was attacked with the weapon, claiming it was "many times more powerful than in the Matrix films."
He and his family were reported to have committed suicide while seeking asylum in the United Kingdom in 2010, but his relatives feared there was foul play involved. Local media reported that Serykh had mental problems.
There had been another suspicious death concerning the futuristic weapon. Two years ago, a former major in the a Russian intelligence agency died, allegedly after making claims about such a weapons program to the British Secret Intelligence Service MI6.
