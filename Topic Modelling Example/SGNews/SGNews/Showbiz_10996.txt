Bollywood glamour is in the air as Indian celebrities descended here for the 13th International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Weekend.
Singapore previously hosted the IIFA event at the Indoor Stadium in 2004.
Mr Sabbas Joseph, director of Mumbai-based agency Wizcraft Entertainment International - which organises the extravaganza - said that although other countries have hosted it more than once, Singapore is the only city to have hosted the IIFA Weekend twice.
At a press conference held yesterday at Raffles City, he said: "We are excited and confident that this year, too, will be grand, spectacular and memorable."
Actresses Chitrangada Singh and Neha Dhupiya, actor Ayushman Khurana and Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann were also present.
According to Zee News, Bollywood bigwigs Shahid Kapoor and Farhan Akhtar were spotted at a Mumbai airport earlier this week. Actors Randhir Kapoor and Rajiv Kapoor and director Ramesh Sippy were also seen.
Shahid, who will co-host the IIFA Awards at the Indoor Stadium tomorrow with Akhtar, will promote his romantic drama Teri Meri Kahaani (Our Story) and will also perform hit Tamil songs.
Actress Bipasha Basu, who arrived on Wednesday, visited the Singapore Zoo yesterday, where she tweeted pictures of her posing with orang utans.
