The former River Valley High School teacher charged for sex with a minor appeared in court dressed in a suit.
This was a stark contrast to Chua Ren Cheng's first appearance at the Subordinate Courts, where he dashed out of the building in a hoodie, cap, sunglasses and a mask to avoid the media.
The 31-year-old was accompanied by his lawyer, Amarjit Singh.
His lawyer asked for an adjournment and was granted one.
Chua will return to court on June 11 for a discovery conference where the prosecution and defence teams will exchange information about the case.
Chua initially said he would plead guilty, but it is uncertain if he will still do so. He allegedly paid $750 for sex with the girl between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on Dec 22, 2010 at the Strand Hotel.
He is among 48 men charged with having paid sex with an underage prostitute.
