NEW YORK - The NBA has slapped Miami forward Udonis Haslem with a one-game suspension and center Dexter Pittman with a three-game ban over incidents in game five of their playoff series against Indiana.
Haslem was suspended for striking Tyler Hansbrough in the head and shoulders during the Heat's 115-83 rout of the Pacers on Tuesday. The Heat lead the series 3-2.
Reserve Pittman was suspended for an illegal elbow to the chin of Indiana guard Lance Stephenson in the final minutes of the game, said league executive vice president Stu Jackson.
Both Haslem and Pittman had their flagrant fouls upgraded to a category two after a video review by the league's disciplinary officials following the game.
Hansbrough was also given a flagrant foul but was not suspended.
Haslem and Pittman will begin serving their suspensions on Thursday when the Pacers host the Heat in game six of their Eastern Conference semi-final series.
