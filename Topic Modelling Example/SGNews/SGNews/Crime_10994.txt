GEORGE TOWN - Three police officers were among four men nabbed by the state Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) for allegedly offering and receiving bribes.
Penang MACC director Datuk M. Samarajoo said the officers from the Pulau Tikus police station and an individual were picked up in two separate operations on Wednesday.
"The police officers were arrested after a report was lodged against them for allegedly receiving a bribe of RM1,500 (S$605).
"In the second case, we picked up an individual here for offering a RM5,000 (S$2,017) bribe to a state secretariat officer.
"The four are expected to be charged in court soon," he said yesterday during the Sun Tzu's Strategies For Thinking MACC Officers seminar here.
Samarajoo said the state MACC had made 31 arrests since January, most of them involving civil servants. Of the 31, six were detained for offering bribes.
On another matter, Samarajoo said MACC found no element of corruption in the RM5 million (S$2 million) controversial "Kancil car park" project at the foot of Penang Hill.
The Penang Development Corporation (PDC) is making preparations to demolish the building.
Nibong Tebal MP Tan Tee Beng had lodged a report with the MACC last year as he was suspicious that Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, PDC and the Penang Municipal Council had allegedly "mischannelled" the funds.
The building was poorly designed with steep ramps, low ceilings and parking bays that were said to be only suitable for Perodua Kancil.
