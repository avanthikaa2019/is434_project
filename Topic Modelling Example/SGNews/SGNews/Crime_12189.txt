MALACCA - Residents here were startled when a foreigner hurled abuse at people and acted aggressively in public without any reason.
It was only after he was detained and brought to the hospital that authorities discovered that a drug capsule he had swallowed earlier had burst in his stomach.
The five-hour drama began at about 10pm on Tuesday when the Nigerian, who is believed to be a student of a university here, began acting aggressively at Taman Melaka Baru.
He went on to shout at people at the Malacca International Trade Centre in Ayer Keroh at 3am.
A team of policemen, who were already watching him when the ruckus started, decided to arrest him and took him to Malacca Hospital, where he slipped into a coma.
Doctors discovered that the man had about 30 ampoules, believed to contain drugs, in his stomach.
It was learnt that 27 ampoules had been retrieved from the man.
