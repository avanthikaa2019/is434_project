TAIPEI - Taiwan prosecutors on Thursday appealed against a court ruling which granted a three-year suspended sentence to a popular Japanese-Taiwanese celebrity for attacking a Taipei taxi driver.
Singer-actress Makiyo, who is known by one name, last month received a lighter sentence than the four-year jail term prosecutors had sought in a case that has captivated Taiwan for months.
Her friend Takateru Tomoyori, a Japanese citizen, got a four-year suspended sentence in the same assault in February.
However, prosecutors said in a statement that the ruling had "many flaws" and that they disagreed with the court for finding the duo guilty of common assault rather than the more serious aggravated assault.
The case stirred a rare bout of anti-Japanese sentiment in Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony until 1945.
Makiyo, 27, initially denied assaulting the taxi driver and claimed that Tomoyori was defending her after the driver touched her chest during an argument.
However, public anger mounted after surveillance camera footage showed that Makiyo joined in the assault and seemed to have encouraged her friend to beat up the driver, who was hospitalised for several weeks for head trauma.
She later apologised and said she did not remember the details because she was drunk.
Makiyo, who was born to a Japanese father and a Taiwanese mother and holds Japanese citizenship, has not been able to work on the island since the authorities revoked her working permit after her indictment.
