An international broadband research specialist is looking for 900 volunteer participants for a year-long study.
The study will help identify areas for improvement to Internet service providers, a vital step in bringing top-notch internet services to local users.
The study is conducted by SamKnows, and backed by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA)
As part of the study, volunteers will receive reliable reports about the service they are receiving which can be used by ISPs to diagnose issues with an Internet connection.
They will be sent a small, purpose-built 'Whitebox' device that plugs into their Internet connection.
When a volunteer's broadband line is not in use, the Whitebox runs a series of automated tests to measure the speed and performance of the connection.
The device only tracks bandwidth speeds and does not collect or track personal internet usage.
