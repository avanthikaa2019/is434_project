MALACCA - Top Taiwanese star Ella Chen and her Malaysian businessman husband, Alvin Lai, held their private wedding reception at the Equatorial Hotel here amid tight security.
Besides 10 bodyguards employed to keep away prying eyes, a dozen Rela members were also deployed.
Their ivory white-themed wedding banquet was attended by around 800 close family members and friends of Alvin, who hails from here.
Gorgeous white and peach-coloured roses filled the extravagantly decorated Dewan Melaka, where the celebrity couple celebrated their union, in the hotel.
Although no press was invited to the event, an insider at the five-star hotel told The Daily Chilli, The Stars news portal, that Alvin paid an estimated S$45,600 for a custom-made wedding do.
He paid S$570 per table and asked for 80 tables. He comes from a well-to-do family. His parents wouldnt allow him to marry a superstar like Ella if he didnt have the money, added the source.
The newly-weds observed the full Chinese tradition at their wedding.
Their day began in the morning with the groom fetching his bride, who was sheltered under a hand-woven tray held by a woman acting as a chaperon, to his familys residence in Ujong Pasir for a tea ceremony.
At Alvin's residence, the couple then served tea to the elders in his family as a sign of respect, starting with his parents.
The parents of Ella, who looked resplendent in white with her face covered by a demure veil, also flew down from Taiwan to witness the ceremony.
I'm just so happy, said the blushing bride on Wednesday when she arrived in Malaysia.
My husband is the best! But I must be careful not to indulge too much in the good food in Malaysia. I will have trouble fitting into my dress.
The singer/actress, who is one-third of the hugely popular Taiwanese pop band S.H.E., wed Alvin in Taipei on May 5.
Although the couple have been friends for quite some time after meeting through Ellas bandmate Hebe Tien, their romance only blossomed one-and-a-half years ago.
