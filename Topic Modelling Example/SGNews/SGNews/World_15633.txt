MANAGUA - It was a bad week for plenty of beachgoers in Nicaragua and a slightly better week for jellyfish, who stung at least 855 bathers who hit the beach on Holy Week break, authorities said.
The vacationers were treated for jellyfish stings on Nicaragua's Pacific coast, most of them at the crowded beaches of Jiquilillo, Masachapa and Pochomil, the local Red Cross said.
Authorities chalked up the high number of bites to the large crowd of Easter holiday beachgoers.
