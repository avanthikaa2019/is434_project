An unemployed man who had sex with a 13-year-old girl on two occasions, and also broke into a church, has been sentenced to three years and six months in prison.
The court heard on Friday that Zulkifri Said, 23, had sex with the minor at the staircase landings of two blocks of flats in Toa Payoh and Jurong.
According to the Straits Times (ST), Zulkifri and the girl met over the internet in 2010 and were in a relationship for eight months.
Although they had broken up, the two would still meet.
They had sex at the staircase landings between November 2010 and February 2011.
After the second encounter, Zulkifi and the girl had an argument, which resulted in her being warded for taking a number of pills.
A social worker then learned of and reported the case to the authorities.
In court, Zulkifi also admitted to breaking into Calvary Bible Presbyterian Church with Muhammad Herwan Abdul Hamzah, 22, on March 4 this year.
They took with them property worth a total of $1,470.
His accomplice was sentenced to jail for two-and-a-half years.
Two other charges of sex with the minor were taken into consideration during his sentencing.
