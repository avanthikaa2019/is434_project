In a landmark ruling, a 39-year-old woman was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail after pleading guilty for operating an unlicensed employment agency (EA).
This is the first custodial sentence since the Employment Agencies Act was amended in 2011.
Under the revised act, Chua Mei Chern was found guilty of four charges, including: declaring false information in a work permit application, illegal employment, abetting in a conspiracy to make a false statement, and for operating an unlicensed EA.
On top of these, she faced 17 other cheating charges under the Penal Code.
For cheating charges, she was sentenced a total of seven years imprisonment on top of her 25-week sentence for the Ministry of Manpower-related charges. The two sentences will run concurrently.
In passing judgment on this landmark case of an unlicensed employment agent, District Judge Liew Thiam Leng considered the prosecution's submissions that she was the mastermind of an illegal operation and had caused harm to five workers.
Under the revised Employment Agencies Act (EAA), which took effect on April 1, 2011, any person who operates or abets an unlicensed employment agency is punishable with a fine of up to $80,000 and up to 24 months' jail, or both.
For subsequent convictions, a fine of up to $160,000 and up to 48 months' jail, or both, will be imposed.
The public are advised to use only MOM-licensed employment agents for their employment needs.
