A former lecturer resorted to stealing money from men she befriended at a casino after losing more than S$40,000 of her savings at the Resort World Sentosa Casino in Singapore, reported China Press and Sin Chew Daily.
Melviana Johnson Fu, 30, was said to have on numerous occasions seduced male winners at casino tables and brought them to hotel rooms for one night stands to steal their cash.
In the first incident, she was reported to have offered sex to a 47-year-old man in exchange for cash two years ago.
However, she stole S$6,300 from his wallet and a credit card while the man was bathing in the hotel room.
She was also said to have repeated the same scam on two 39-year-old men, stealing their belongings after having sex with them.
A district court sentenced her to 10 months' jail on Wednesday for three counts of theft.
Her lawyer pleaded for leniency, saying that before becoming a gambling addict, the former lecturer from a university in Kuala Lumpur used to be a role model teacher.
Kwong Wah Yit Poh reported of prostitution rings in Taiwan using international coffee chains to schedule meetings between agents, pimps, sex workers and even clients as a means to hoodwink the authorities.
Quoting a report from Taiwan's Apple Daily, it said an agent would bring girls to meet several female pimps every weekday afternoon.
It also said that the pimps even arranged for potential customers to meet up with their girls at the same outlet.
