PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - A Malaysian businessman's gift of a white Ferrari to former celebrity couple reality star Kim Kardashian and basketball player Kris Humphries for their wedding is set to steal the limelight in their divorce proceedings.
Britain's Daily Mail reported that the 27-year-old NBA player wanted his wife to tell the truth regarding the US$325,000 (S$408,167) car.
Humphries wants to know what happened to the luxury car given to them by a "wealthy Malaysian businessman" who had reportedly attended their wedding, among other things.
However, a representative of Kardashian told a website that she had bought the car herself.
Her lawyer Laura Wesser accused Humphries of seeking publicity by trying to prolong the proceedings to dissolve the 72-day marriage.
The couple separated last October and the 31-year-old Kardashian has a new boyfriend in musician Kanye West.
The spat came up after Kardashian recently announced that she was donating US$200,000 (RM600,000) to charity to cover "double the value" of their wedding gifts.
However, a website reported that she had obviously "forgotten" to factor in the pricey Ferrari.
It said although Humphries has no intention of asking for the car, his attorneys do intend to question Kardashian under oath as to why she did not include the value of the car when she tallied up the value of their wedding gifts.
A source told the paper that Humphries was "not interested in the money", but was doing all he could to get the truth out.
He is seeking an annulment but his legal team is undecided on whether to pursue allegations that the marriage was a fraud.
The only way this case would not go to trial is if Kardashian publicly apologises to Humphries and admits that she only married him for television ratings, the report stated, quoting a source close to Humphries.
They have to return to court on Aug 15 for a status hearing.
