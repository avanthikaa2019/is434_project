The humble headset that most people use for their phones and MP3 players is largely wired, but a new breed of wireless headsets is slowly emerging.
"Slowly" because such headsets are few and far between and they are also costly, compared to their wired counterparts.
Plantronics, a maker of Bluetooth headsets for mobile phones, has a new offering that may take the trend of Bluetooth stereo headsets a bit further.
The BackBeat Go Bluetooth headset weighs 13g and can provide up to 41/2 hours of listening or talk time, plus 10 hours on standby.
Sound quality is not bad, although I still feel corded headsets have an edge.
The biggest advantage of the BackBeat Go is the elimination of the cord to the player/phone.
How much: $169
