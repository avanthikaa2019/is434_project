An H-2A rocket carrying a South Korean satellite is scheduled to be launched from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture on Friday.
It will be the 21st launch of the H-2A rocket, but the first to carry a foreign satellite.
Launching a foreign satellite is a long-held dream among people in the country's space program. If the launch is successful, it could help Japan win a piece of the world's satellite launch market.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., which is in charge of the launch, received the order to launch the South Korean multipurpose satellite Arirang-3.
The satellite will obtain high resolution images for map-making, environmental studies, agriculture and other purposes.
After the failure of the No. 6 rocket in 2003, H-2A rockets have made 14 consecutive successful launches, a success rate of 95 per cent.
"By successfully launching [the H-2A], we want to increase the rocket's appeal in the international market," said Shoichiro Asada, general manager of MHI's Space Systems Department.
About 40 people, including executives of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute and the media will visit Tanegashima island to observe the launch.
To welcome them, students at a local middle school made signs that read "Pray for a successful launch" in both Japanese and Korean, and installed them at two locations in the center of Minamitane, home to the space center.
The local community also supports the attempt to launch a foreign satellite, with restaurants preparing menus written in Korean.
However, launching a satellite from Japan is expensive compared to launching one from other countries because of the strong yen, making it difficult for Japan to obtain overseas orders.
The No. 21 rocket will also carry three other satellites, including a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency satellite that will monitor climate change and the earth's water.
