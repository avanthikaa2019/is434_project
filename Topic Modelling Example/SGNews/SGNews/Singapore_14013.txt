Wilford Goh, 18, a classically-trained pianist, can also make his violin sing with ease.
Says his mother, Mrs Veronica Goh: "When he was three, he asked to learn the piano after seeing someone play it. We thought he was too young, so we sent him to music appreciation classes.
"By the time he got to primary school, we noticed he was always above average," says Mrs Goh, who works in a church organisation.
In the same year he started primary school at Montfort Junior School, Wilford asked to pick up another instrument - the violin.
At the age of six, he was selected through auditions to join the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts' School of Young Talents.
Just three years later, he achieved Grade 8 in both the violin and piano from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, which awarded him with distinctions for both instruments.
The recent graduate of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)'s International Baccalaureate programme scored 42 points out of a maximum of 45.
He is waiting to enter national service.
