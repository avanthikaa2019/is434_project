SINGAPORE - A man was jailed four weeks for punching a cabby in the face, after refusing to pay his taxi fare.
The court heard that Jeevan Ashok, 24, a manager, took a cab driven by Mr Lip Tuck Seng, 46, from Orchard Towers to Tampines Street 23 on Aug 30 last year.
He refused to pay the $27 cab fare on arrival and walked off.
Mr Lip gave chase, demanding payment. Another taxi driver, Mr Yeo Tee Yoong, 45, drove past and stopped to help.
They caught up with Jeevan, who still refused to pay, and claimed that he did not take Mr Lip's cab at all, reported The Straits Times.
He then challenged them to a fight, saying that he had secret society links. Mr Lip said he did not want to fight, but Jeevan punched him in the face.
Jeevan was previously convicted for disorderly behaviour and traffic-related offences.
He was fined $1,500 after pleading guilty to a charge of disorderly behaviour at a Tampines carpark on Jan 1, 2012. Another similar charge was considered during his sentencing.
