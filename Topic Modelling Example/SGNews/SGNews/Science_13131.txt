Twelve asteroids discovered by the Lowell Observatory in the US state of Arizona have been named after areas in the Tohoku region affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake.
According to the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, naming rights are given to the individual or group that contributes most to the observation of an asteroid.
The Lowell Observatory's Edward Bowell, who discovered the asteroids, and other researchers agreed they should be named after devastated areas in Japan in the hope they will be rebuilt.
Some of the asteroids, which are impossible to see with the naked eye, were named Hamadori, Nakadori and Aizu after areas in Fukushima Prefecture.
Others were named Miyagi, Iwate and Rikuzen-Takata.
"Asteroids named after the devastated areas are out there somewhere. I hope it encourages those involved in reconstruction efforts," said Junichi Watanabe, deputy director of the NAOJ.
