SINGAPORE - Central Provident Fund (CPF) members can top-up the Ordinary and Retirement accounts of their parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law from January next year.
Currently, this can be done only for their spouses, siblings, parents and grandparents.
Individuals who make cash top-ups to their parents- in-laws' and grandparents- in-laws' accounts will be granted income-tax relief.
Only cash top-ups qualify for the tax relief, although CPF members can also use additional savings from their own Ordinary accounts for the top-up if they have met the minimum-sum requirement of $131,000.
The maximum amount of tax relief CPF members can now enjoy for top-ups to family members is $14,000, including cash top-ups made into the individual's own CPF account.
The changes to the CPF Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme were announced yesterday by Minister of State for National Development and Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin at a retirement security conference The changes would spur individuals to enhance the retirement adequacy of their loved ones, he said.
