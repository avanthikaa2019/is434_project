TAIPEI - Taiwan rock band Mayday won a string of awards, including best album and best band, at the Golden Melody Awards for Asia's best Mandarin chart music in Taipei on Saturday.
"I want to thank our fans who have supported us for the past 13 years and I want to thank the judges," Mayday lead singer Ashin told a cheering crowd in the Taipei Arena.
The five-member band also bagged best song of the year, best producer, best composer and best arrangement for its latest hit album "Second Round."
Singapore singer-composer Tanya Chua saw off Taiwan pop divas A-Mei and Hebe Tien as well as fellow Singaporean Stefanie Sun to win her third best female singer title.
"I feel like I am dreaming, I didn't expect to win this award again," Chua said.
Taiwanese rocker Ascent Chan was the night's surprise winner when he beat four better known rivals, including Hong Kong's Eason Chan and Taiwan pop star and last year's winner Jay Chou, to be crowned best male singer.
"I actually thought I'd lose. I want to thank Jay Chou... I want to thank the judges and my family," he said.
Performers from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore competed in more than 20 categories at the 23rd edition of the awards.
