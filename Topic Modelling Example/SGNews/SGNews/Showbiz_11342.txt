JAPAN - The Cultural Affairs Agency has begun collecting information on more than 300,000 anime and manga titles in a database that will be opened to the public in fiscal 2014.
The project is part of the government's "Cool Japan" strategy to promote the nation.
The agency also aims to use the project to help foster the country's cultural industry.
The database, covering anime, manga, games and media arts that utilize computer graphics, will store such information as the names of the creators, details of the content and locations where the products originated. To help with Internet searches, the agency will display information about original works on which anime were based.
The database will assume part of the functions of what would have been a state-run media arts center dubbed the "hall of anime."
The center was planned in 2009 under the administration of then Prime Minister Taro Aso as a base to collect, display and study anime and other pop culture products.
However, the Democratic Party of Japan criticized the plan as a waste of money and canceled construction of the center.
