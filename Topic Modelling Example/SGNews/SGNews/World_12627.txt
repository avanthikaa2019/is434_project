JACKSON, Michigan - Teenager Ryan Hart was finishing off his sandwich when he bit on something that he thought tasted like rubber.
However, when he spat it out, he was shocked to discover that it was a fleshy, severed part of an Arby's employee's finger, reported the Associated Press.
The 14-year-old told a local newspaper in his city that when he inspected the object, he knew what had been in the junior roast beef sandwich he was eating last Friday.
Hart told the Jackson Citizen Patriot: "I was about to puke... It was just nasty."
The severed finger was almost 3cm long.
It was later discovered that an employee had severed her finger on a meat slicer but left work without telling anyone.
Her co-workers continued to serve food and fulfil orders until they realised what had happened.
In a statement released on Wednesday, John Gray, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Arby's, apologised for the 'unfortunate incident'.
He added that the restaurant had stopped food production, and cleaned and sanitised the restaurant thoroughly after discovering what happened.
Arby's is still investigating the matter, and health officials have allowed the eatery to remain open.
While Ryan said he is feeling fine, his mother is furious over the episode.
The family is mulling whether to pursue legal action over the matter.
