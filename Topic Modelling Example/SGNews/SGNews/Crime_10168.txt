An odd-job worker was jailed for four months on Friday for engaging the services of an underage Vietnamese prostitute on June 19 last year.
Tan Wah Eng, 60, had unprotected sexual intercourse with the girl, then 17 years old, at the Four Chain View Hotel in Geylang.
After that, he paid the teenager $120.
Tan had been introduced to the girl by his acquaintance, Seng Swee Meng, 42, at a nearby coffee shop that day.
Seng, who was jobless, was jailed for five years on April 11.
He had pleaded guilty in January to 15 charges for offences including harbouring prostitutes, receiving them at Changi Airport and abetting to obtain commercial sex with minors.
Thirty-six other charges for similar offences were taken into consideration during his sentencing.
For having commercial sex with a prostitute below 18 years of age, Tan could have been jailed up to seven years and fined.
