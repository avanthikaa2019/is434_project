The visitors will call it a Greek tragedy - two refereeing decisions going against them in the space of three minutes just before half-time to reduce them to 10 men and then deny them a penalty.
In the 44th minute, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, already on a yellow for fouling Robert Lewandowski less than 10 minutes earlier,was adjudged to have pushed Rafal Murawski, preventing the Polish midfielder from going through on goal.
But The New Paper's referee analyst Francis Lee said it was a "weak yellow", and that the 23-year-old Greek defender should not have been sent off.
He said: "Papastathopoulos had his hands on Murawski, but the Poland player was already losing his balance before there was contact."
Perhaps it wouldn't have been such a surprise if the Greeks realised referee Carlos Velasco Carballo dished out 178 yellow cards and 16 red cards in 29 La Liga games last season, according to ESPN's Dale Johnson.
However, Lee felt the Spaniard got it spot-on with his decision not to award Greece a penalty less than three minutes later, when Poland defender Damien Perquis' arm clearly made contact with the ball.
He said: "It was unintentional. Perquis slipped, and he didn't know where the ball was. You can see clearly his arm was not stretched out to block the ball.
"If the referee had seen the incident and let play go on, he was right to deem it ball to hand instead."
Penalty or not, considering how the Greeks played in the second half, imagine what could have happened if they had not lost a man to a very harsh decision.
