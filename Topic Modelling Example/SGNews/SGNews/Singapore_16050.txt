More than 30,000 free scoops of ice cream were given away by Ben &amp; Jerry's today to thank their supporters.
For this year's Free Cone Day, the ice cream maker's seven scoop shops across the island saw crowds even before doors opened at 2pm. Opening hours were extended till 8pm, from 7pm last year to accommodate office workers who wanted to get a free scoop.
Those who came in groups of four got a free upgrade to a pint for sharing, netting an extra scoop for free.
As part of its support for Earth Hour Singapore 2012, fans were encouraged to give generously to WWF.
The annual tradition was started by founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield at the Burlington Gas Station in Vermont, USA. Free Cone Day is now celebrated in many of the 800 scoop shops around the globe from North America to Europe and Asia.
For those who were not able to get free ice cream today, Ben &amp; Jerry's will be giving away a free scoop voucher for a min $19.79 purchase (in a single receipt) in the month of April to commemorate the year that Free Cone Day was started.
