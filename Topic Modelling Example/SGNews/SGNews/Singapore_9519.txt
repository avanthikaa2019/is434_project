KUALA LUMPUR - Perkasa wants Singapore to recall its three diplomatic staff here over their alleged involvement in the April 28 rally and apologise to the Malaysian public and Government.
Led by their president Datuk Ibrahim Ali, about 200 members of the Malay rights group gathered outside the republic's High Commission in Jalan Tun Razak to hand over a protest letter yesterday.
He and four others - deputy president Datuk Abdul Rahaman Bakar, vice-president Zulkifli Noordin, secretary-general Syed Hassan Syed Ali and historian Datuk Ramlah Adam - entered the commission to meet its officials.
Their supporters, who arrived in six tour buses, remained outside the building and chanted slogans against Singapore and sang patriotic songs.
The police were present to control the situation.
Speaking at a press conference later, Ibrahim said they would not pressure the Singapore government to fulfil their demands but would "wait and see" how best the republic would handle the issue.
In a meeting with Asean diplomatic missions on June 11, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman had raised the involvement of foreign diplomats during the rally, saying it might lead to negative perception about the good relations between Malaysia and the respective countries.
Last week, Singapore High Commissioner Ong Keng Yong was summoned to Wisma Putra, where Anifah conveyed the displeasure of the Malaysian Government over three envoys from the republic taking part in the rally.
The Singaporean government has dismissed allegations that it interfered in the domestic politics of Malaysia.
