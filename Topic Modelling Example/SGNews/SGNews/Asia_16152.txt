Okinawa Electric Power Co said on Monday its one-megwatt solar power farm on Japan's southern Okinawa island started operating on March 29, as planned, as the government prepares for a July launch of a subsidy scheme to spur electricity from renewable sources.
Japan is overhauling its energy policy after the Fukushima radiation crisis in March 2011 shattered public confidence in the safety of nuclear power.
To accelerate the growth of renewable energy sources, parliament approved bills last year requiring utilities to buy output from five sources - solar, wind, geothermal, small-sized hydro and biomass power - at pre-set rates enough to lure investors for the first three years.
Japan's 10 regional power companies drew up plans in 2008 to build a total of 22 large solar plants with capacity of 102.3 megawatts to help the world's fifth-biggest emitter cut greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring energy security.
Their plans could be followed by dozens more large solar projects by non-utility companies if the pricing for the scheme is as lucrative as what Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association has proposed of 42 yen ($0.5) per kilowatt hour for 20 years.
A panel of experts started a debate on the pricing last month and is expected to finalise a report to Trade Minister Yukio Edano in May at the earliest.
