Singapore has a lower crime rate than many other cities, and is recognised as one of the safest countries in the world.
This is what Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said at this year's police workplan seminar at the Home Team Academy, reported The Straits Times.
DPM Teo credited the police with doing well in investigating and solving crime, especially serious offences.
He said that out of 16 murders that took place last year, only one case remained unsolved. Eighty-seven per cent of housebreaking cases last year were also solved, while culprits behind the DBS ATM skimming case which affected hundreds were arrested within a short time.
DPM Teo emphasised that the police must look ahead to see how it can better meet the demands of the future amidst rising public expectations.
The nature of crime has also been changing, especially through the use of technology, and the police cannot overcome these challenges by hiring more people or doing more of the same things they have done well before, he added.
