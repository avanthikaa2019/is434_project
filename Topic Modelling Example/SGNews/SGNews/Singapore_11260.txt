MALAYSIA - Six Singaporeans were injured when their tour bus nearly plunged into a ravine in Sarawak on Sunday, The Star reported.
Their bus, ferrying them back from a two-day church retreat, overturned very close to a 50m-deep ravine.
It was trailing behind another tour bus when the driver lost control of the vehicle after negotiating a sharp bend on the mountainous road.
Police said the driver of the bus in front stepped on the brakes to stop the second bus from rolling into the ravine.
