TOKYO - South Korea secured their place at the London Olympics after beating Peru in straight sets on the final day on Sunday of the women's volleyball qualifying tournament.
With a 25-11, 25-18, 25-21 victory, the South Koreans finished with a 5-2 win-loss record for 15 points behind world champions Russia, 25-14, 25-17, 25-17 winners over Taiwan.
"We couldn't take part in the Beijing Olympics and we struggled since then, but today we were able to achieve our dream," said South Korean coach Kim Hyung-Sil.
"We won the bronze medal in the Olympics 36 years ago. We'll do our best to win a medal again. Hopefully, our men's team will also qualify for the Olympics.
"And we defeated Japan 3-1... that boosted our confidence a lot. After that, we got better and better."
Hwang Youn-Joo, the team's top scorer of the day with 14 points, said injuries had prevented South Korea from getting to the Olympics last time.
"This time, everybody had a strong feeling to go to the London Olympics as a unified team. We tried hard to do and we made it," said Hwang.
Earlier in the day, Thailand outclassed former world champions Cuba 25-23, 25-23, 18-25, 25-21 to keep their Olympic hopes alive. They now need to wait for the outcome of the match between Serbia and hosts Japan later.
The top three teams in the eight-team round robin and the best-placed Asian side among the rest qualify for the Olympics.
Italy, the United States and China have already qualified after taking medals at the World Cup last year with continental winners Algeria, the Dominican Republic, Turkey, Brazil, as well as hosts Britain, joining them.
