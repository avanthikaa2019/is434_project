SINGAPORE - She may have become $416,000 richer, but Mdm Choo Hong Eng feels that winning the money has given her more problems such as losing friends.
Dubbed the "Jackpot Aunty", Mdm Choo, 58, had taken on Marina Bay Sands (MBS) casino to claim the $416,742.16 she won at a slot machine, and received the cash in full last November.
However, after seeing reports about her winnings, friends started calling her every other day to ask for money for loans or to help pay bills, she told The Straits Times (ST).
She lost many of these friends, some whom go back 30 years, after she turned them down. "But what can I do? I can't help so many people," she told ST in Mandarin.
The devout Buddhist has made good her plans to give half her winnings to charity. ST reported that she donated $280,000 to 26 charities, each getting between $5,000 and $20,000.
Just like her "friends", other charities have also approached her for donations. She feels bad declining them. Mdm Choo has lost 3kg due to the stress of handling these requests.
An avid volunteer, Mdm Choo also spent $60,000 on volunteer work such as cooking up meals for 3,500 residents in welfare homes, and has given a separate donation to the victims of the Bangkok floods.
Last October, the hawker was playing the slot machines when the "Cash Bonus" sign appeared.
However, she was told that instead of the full jackpot, she would get $50,000 and a sports car worth $258,962 instead.
She complained to the Casino Regulatory Authority, and was given her winnings in full a month later.
Mdm Choo said that she didn't spend a single cent on herself or her two adopted daughters. She still lives in the same HDB flat and drives the same Volkswagen delivery van.
However, she has sworn off going into casinos, saying the win was just "pure luck".
While she wishes things would "go back to normal", she is thankful for the few "real friends" that have stood by her without badgering her for handouts or resenting her win.
