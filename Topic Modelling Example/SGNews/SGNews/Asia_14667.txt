Police detained nine teenagers Wednesday for killing a 17-year-old girl and burying the body in a park.
Police in Ilsan, on the outskirts of Seoul, said the runaway boys and girls beat the victim with blunt weapons on April 5 for badmouthing them. Two of them, however, felt guilty and later turned themselves in.
Police will seek arrest warrants for the five suspects who are believed to have led in committing the crime.
