JARKARTA, Indonesia - Soekarno-Hatta International Airport police on Thursday arrested ten out of 14 suspects who allegedly had stolen fuel worth Rp 1 billion (S$140,000) over the past four months from aircraft fuel tanks.
Airport police deputy chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Tatan Sulistiyana identified the 10 suspects as AS, ED, IB, IS, MF, MJ, RMB, RMS and YS, who all worked as aviation technicians at the airport.
Tatan said SY, IS and RMS were Sriwijaya Air employees assigned to conduct daily technical check-ups on airplanes that were parked at the airport's terminals at night, but did not mention which company the other suspects worked for.
"The suspects, assisted by other technicians, siphoned avtur [aviation turbine fuel] from airplane fuel tanks into dozens of containers they had previously prepared," he said.
One of the suspects said he had stolen the fuel because he received a salary of only Rp 1.5 a month, which was "far from enough" to meet his family's needs.
Tatan said the suspects allegedly sold every 35-liter container of fuel for Rp 200,000 to a fence, who later found interested customers.
He said police arrested the group of technicians as a result of an operation conducted between March and April. Law enforcement seized a total of 2 tons of fuel, stored in 57 containers, three vehicles used to transport the stolen fuel and Rp 6 million cash from the suspects as evidence.
"What the suspects did could have endangered [passengers] because if airplanes run out of fuel while flying without a recheck before flying, we can imagine what would happen," he said.
Tatan said the suspects could face seven years in prison under the Criminal Code.
