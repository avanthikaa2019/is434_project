With poetic flair, grittiness and sensitivity, American writer-director Paul Weitz (About A Boy) has given Robert De Niro his best role in years.
The Oscar-winning thespian delivers a powerhouse performance as eccentric and down-on-luck cab driver Jonathan Flynn, who reconnects with his son Nick (a superbly unhinged Paul Dano) after a long absence.
A soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy adds to the indie flavour, while Julianne Moore provides strong support.
Being Flynn (M18) Drama/102 minutes Rating: 4/5 stars
