YOKOHAMA - A 17-year-old male high school student was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of possessing weapons including a converted handgun capable of killing a person, police said Tuesday.
According to the Metropolitan Police Department, a revolver converted to fire ammunition, four air guns and two toy guns resembling real ones were found in the boy's home in Yokohama on March 20. The student was arrested on June 18.
Possession of weapons that fire ammunition is a violation of the Firearms and Swords Control Law.
According to the MPD, the student collected model guns and played survival games as a hobby. He allegedly made fake guns and has put them on sale on Internet auction sites for between 10,000 yen (S$160) and 25,000 yen since 2008.
He also illegally converted a toy gun into a real weapon by drilling holes into the cylinder and making other changes, and test-fired the handgun at empty cans, the police said.
The student attends a high school with a high rate of success in university entrance examinations, and is believed to have learned how to convert fake guns through the Internet and by other means.
The student was quoted by police as saying: "I watched 007 [James Bond] movies and became interested in guns. I thought there would be no problem if I didn't use them on other people."
