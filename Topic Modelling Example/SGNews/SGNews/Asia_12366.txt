TAIPEI - Taiwan's intelligence chief said yesterday that China plans to build two aircraft carriers in addition to the first in its fleet, a refitted former Soviet carrier currently undergoing sea trials.
"Indeed, the Chinese communists have decided to build two aircraft carriers on their own," Mr Tsai Teh-sheng, head of the island's National Security Bureau, told Parliament.
Mr Tsai said that construction of the warships is slated to start in 2013 and 2015 respectively, with delivery dates of 2020 and 2022, and that they would be conventionally powered.
He said that since the middle of last year, China had conducted six sea trials of its first carrier, and that Taiwan expected it to go into service before the end of this year.
"Initially, it may simply serve for training purposes, but it can be transferred for battles when necessary in the future," he said.
The Chinese ship's sea trials have sparked international concern about China's widening naval reach, amid growing regional tensions over maritime disputes and a United States campaign to assert itself as a Pacific power.
Mr Tsai's comments came in response to queries from Mr Lin Yu-fang, a lawmaker from the ruling Kuomintang party, who said the development could force Taiwan's entire defence strategy to be overhauled.
"Once the two warships join the Chinese navy, their threat to Taiwan will be way larger than that of the 'Varyag'," he said, referring to the reconditioned 1980s Soviet-era carrier.
