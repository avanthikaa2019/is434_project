Four male and one female subjects aged between 15 and 21 years old have been arrested by the police for vandalising electrical meter boxes.
The police received a report on April 13 from a Yishun housing estate resident informing them of someone tampering with the electrical meter unit out side his home, causing power failure.
The officers saw that other electrical meter units had also been tampered with, with some of the boxes covering the units suffering from damage.
After conducting a probe and using information provided by residents, officers established the identities of those involved and arrested them in the Yishun Street 72 area on April 16.
According to preliminary investigations, the five subjects are believed to be responsible for other similar cases in Yishun housing estates between April 13 and 14.
Investigations are ongoing.
Anyone found guilty of vandalism can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed up to three years.
Convicted males who are 50 years old or below can also be caned between three and eight strokes.
Commander of Ang Mo Kio Police Division, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police, Keok Tong San commended his officers and the community for their partnership.
