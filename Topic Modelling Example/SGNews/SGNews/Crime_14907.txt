KUALA TERENGGANU - An 18-year-old suspect, who was shot in the left thigh, endured pain for more than 20 hours to avoid being nabbed by the police.
When police caught up with him, he had only bandaged the injured thigh and was being treated at the Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital.
Terengganu CID chief Asst Comm K. Manoharan said he was shot by the house owner after fleeing with another youth during a house break-in in Kampung Palas, Bukit Payung on Monday.
Police are still looking for the other suspect.
