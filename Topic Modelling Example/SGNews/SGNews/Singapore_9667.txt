SINGAPORE - The Merlion will be closed to the public for two months for repairs and cleaning.
During the makeover, the stains on the Merlion will be removed and fine cracks will be filled in.
The waveform on which it rests will also be replaced, said The Straits Times.
The closure of the iconic statue is the longest since it was built in 1972.
It will re-open again in time for its 40th birthday on Sept 15.
In the meantime, panels of artwork featuring the Merlion are placed around the scaffolding so tourists who visit the icon may still be able to take photographs there.
