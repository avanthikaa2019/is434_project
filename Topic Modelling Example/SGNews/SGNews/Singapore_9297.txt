SINGAPORE - Mr Freddy Lee Thaim Yew, younger brother of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, died of cancer yesterday afternoon at home.
The former chairman of Vickers Ballas, one of Singapore's most prominent stockbroking firms, had just celebrated his 85th birthday earlier this month.
He leaves behind his wife Eleanor Ngo Puay Chin and four children: Edmund, Tina, Jeffrey and Selena.
Ms Tina Lee, 50, told The Straits Times that her father had prostate cancer six years ago but recovered from it. Last month, however, he was hospitalised twice in less than two weeks.
He fortunately managed to return home in time for his 85th birthday celebration on June 4. Yesterday, his doctor went to his home twice. He died at 3pm with his family by his bedside.
The paper reported that his three siblings visited him last week. Youngest brother Suan Yew met him about a week ago, eldest brother Kuan Yew on Sunday and sister Monica on Wednesday evening.
Mr Lee was a teacher for three years before he joined the police force in 1950. He stayed there for 18 years.
In 1970, he became a partner of stockbroking firm J. Ballas and Co, the predecessor of Vickers Ballas. He stepped down as chairman in 2000 before its merger with DBS Securities in 2001.
After retirement Mr Lee spent his days playing golf and breeding and training race horses. He once owned a horse farm in New Zealand.
Described as a doting grandfather, Mr Lee would set aside Fridays to spend time with his grandchildren, three of whom live in US while the rest are in Singapore.
The wake is at the family home at 37 Coronation Road West. The funeral service for Mr Lee will be held at St Andrew's Cathedral on Monday at 11am. He will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium.
