SINGAPORE - It is believed to be Asia's largest women-only run.
And this year's Great Eastern Women's Run promises to be even more exciting as it will include a half marathon.
Speaking at the launch of the event at ION Orchard yesterday, Great Eastern's general manager (Singapore), Khoo Kah Siang said: "For this year's run, in addition to the 5km and 10km categories, we will be introducing a 21km category to cater to the more serious runners.
"This will be the first women-only half marathon in the region."
To launch the event, high-profile local personalities like Irene Ang competed yesterday in a "Shop and Run Challenge" to raise funds for charity.
The Guest-of-Honour at yesterday's launch was Associate Professor Fatimah Lateef, Member of Parliament for Marine Parade GRC and a seasoned marathoner.
Said Prof Fatimah: "Women in Singapore generally find it difficult to carve time out of their busy schedules for sports.
"A race such as the Great Eastern Women's Run will encourage more women to take up running and lead more balanced, healthier and more fulfilling lives."
Participants will run past iconic Singapore landmarks such as The Float @ Marina Bay, the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer.
Said Dr Khoo: "The run promises to be scenic and we hope to attract more than 15,000 participants."
Those who find the half marathon too challenging can participate in the 10km and 5km categories instead.
