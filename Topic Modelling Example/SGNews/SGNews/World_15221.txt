UNITED NATIONS - The UN Security Council will vote Saturday on a Western-drafted resolution allowing a ceasefire observer mission in Syria even though Russia is not certain to back the text, diplomats said.
The 15-member council will hold the vote at 1500 GMT (11:00 pm local time) on Saturday.
UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan has called for the speedy adoption of a council resolution to allow an advance mission of 30 military observers to go to Syria next week to monitor a ceasefire which started Thursday.
Russia's UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he was not "completely satisfied" with the talks held at the UN on Friday however.
Russia and China have vetoed two previous Security Council resolutions on Syria.
Neither the United States nor its allies would say that the resolution would be subject to a new veto.
"It would be wise not to make predictions," said US ambassador Susan Rice.
"We have been to this movie so many times."
The United States will send a new version of a draft resolution to the other 14 members of the council late Friday and national governments will then decide whether to back the text, Churkin said.
