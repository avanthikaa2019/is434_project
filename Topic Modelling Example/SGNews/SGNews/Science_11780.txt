In the early days of the iPhone, before the deluge of battery packs for iOS devices, Mophie made the best battery packs for iPhones.
They not only delivered extra battery juice to fading iPhones but also protected the device from knocks and dents. Of course, it's a different story now, what with the abundance of add-on battery packs bundled with all kinds of features.
Still, the latest generation of Mophie battery packs retains the quality and durability of earlier Mophies.
When the packing says 1,500mAh or 2,000mAh, rest assured that they can store and deliver that amount of battery power. And they are cheaper too.
A new series of external batteries is also available - Juice Pack Powerstation (for on-the-go power) and Powerstation Pro, which packs as much as 6,000mAh of battery power.
How much: Juice Pack ($109), Juice Pack Plus ($139), Juice Pack Powerstation ($109), Juice Pack Powerstation Pro ($179).
