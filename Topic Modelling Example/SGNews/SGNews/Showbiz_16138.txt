French gypsy-rock group Les Yeux Noirs will be performing in Singapore this April.
Brought here by the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise de Singapour, they will stage their concert at the AF Auditorium on April 12 at 8pm. Tickets are on sale at all Sistic outlets from $30 for AF members and $40 for non-members.
Founded by two brothers, Eric and Olivier Slabiak, both violinists, the group has cruised through the numerous concerts, festivals, caf&eacute;s and cabarets all over the world where they perform the music of Eastern Europe.
Their name, Les Yeux Noirs (Dark Eyes), is taken from a 19th century song made popular by Django Reinhardt among many others.
