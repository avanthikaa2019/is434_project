LONDON - Northern Irish police said Tuesday it had arrested six people after a man threatened attacks against police and soldiers by republican dissidents opposed to the British province's peace process.
The balaclava-clad spokesman for the Real IRA group pledged the attacks at an event Monday in the province's second city, Londonderry, marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland.
"The IRA will continue to attack Crown Force personnel, their installations, as well as British interests and infrastructure," the spokesman, wearing black combat gear, said at the wreath-laying ceremony.
Police said the six arrested men were taken to Antrim, 53 miles (85 kilometres) south-east of Londonderry, for questioning.
The Real IRA has been blamed for a series of attacks, including the murders of two soldiers in 2009.
Northern Ireland endured three decades of sectarian bombings and shootings pitting Catholics who wanted the province to join with the Republic of Ireland against Protestants who wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The violence largely ended with 1998 peace accords, which paved the way for a power-sharing administration in Belfast, but sporadic attacks continue.
