Police have arrested a 25-year-old man believed to be involved in a spate of cases of criminal breach of trust involving photography equipment.
Since Apr 6, 20120, police have received several similar reports alleging that a man had rented photography equipment from electronics shops and then failed to return them.
Officers from the Central Police Division conducted extensive enquiries and managed to establish the identity of the suspect.
At about 10.15am yesterday, officers mounted an operation and arrested the suspect along Havelock Road.
Based on preliminary investigations, the suspect is believed to be involved in at least five other similar cases committed at electronic shops located in Chinatown, New Bridge Road and Coleman Street.
In the course of investigations, photography equipment comprising five cameras, four camera chargers, a camera lens, eight camera batteries and other photography accessories have been recovered and seized as exhibits.
The suspect will be charged in the Subordinate Courts tomorrow for the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust, which carries a maximum jail term of seven years imprisonment, or with fine or both.
