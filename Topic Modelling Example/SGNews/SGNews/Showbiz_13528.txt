US pop star Britney Spears, 30, recently tweeted a video of her sons Sean Preston, six, and Jayden, five, doing the boogie to We No Speak Americano by Australian duo Yolanda Be Cool.
They were dressed as Star Wars character Boba Fett and Marvel superhero Iron Man.
What's more, a funky filter was applied to the video, giving Spears' kids a decidedly retro look as they excitedly pranced around for the camera.
Spears tweeted: "We shot a fun video for y'all... Hint: it involves my boys... more to come, I promise!"
We're certainly waiting with bated breath.
