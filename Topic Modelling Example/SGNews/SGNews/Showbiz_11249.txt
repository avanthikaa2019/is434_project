Magic buffs, look out for the world's largest touring magic and illusion show, Masters Of Illusion - Live!, as it rolls into town.
The extravaganza will be staged at Singapore Expo on Saturday and Sunday.
The show is a spin-off from the American television series, Masters Of Illusion, and is inspired by the World Magic Awards, recognised as the International Academy Awards of Magic.
The show will feature a who's who in the magic world. The cast of five acts are Joaquin Ayala and Tanya; Darren Romeo; Farrell Dillon; Kalin and Jinger; as well as Kevin James, who was a semi-finalist on America's Got Talent 2007.
They have all won the prestigious The World Magic Award before. And 10 my paper readers can get to watch them in action - for free.
Show organiser Unusual Entertainment will give each winner a pair of tickets worth $98 each to the show on Sunday.
To stand a chance of winning the tickets, answer the following question: Kevin James was a semi-finalist on America's Got Talent.
