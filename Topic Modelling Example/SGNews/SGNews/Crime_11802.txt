KUALA LUMPUR - Federal CID director Commissioner Datuk Seri Bakri Zinin has refuted claims that kidnap cases were on the rise.
In reality, he said such cases were actually on a downward trend due to efforts by the Criminal Investigation Department in tracking down and crippling kidnapping syndicates.
"From 2010 to May 15, a total of 80 kidnap-for-ransom cases were reported to the police.
Of the number, 59 were solved and 61 victims were returned to safety, either after the ransom was delivered or as a result of police intervention," he said in a statement yesterday.
He was refuting a reader's letter published in an English daily which claimed that kidnap cases were on the rise and that kidnappers were now preying on students of international schools.
Comm Bakri said there had only been one reported case of an international school student being kidnapped.
"It is, therefore, inaccurate to state that it has become a trend for kidnappers to target victims in international schools."
