A local teenage radio station in Medan, North Sumatra, Kiss 105 FM, banned Justin Bieber's songs as a protest against the teenage pop sensation's remarks on Indonesia that sparked strong reactions from his fans - known as Beliebers - in the country.
The British tabloid, the Daily Mirror, reported that Bieber recently "mocked the English accent, insulted Indonesia and threw a hissy fit," when in London to premiere his new album, Believe.
During the event, Bieber told an interviewer about the creative process for one of his new tracks, saying it was recorded in some "random country". His manager, Scott "Scooter" Braun, interrupted and informed him it was produced in Indonesia.
"His tone was very condescending and he is just a 19-year-old boy. This is a country with more than 200 million citizens," Kiss FM executive producer Anggi Simanjuntak told The Jakarta Post on Saturday.
Anggi said that the policy was apparently supported by heartbroken radio listeners. "Some of them unfollowed or even blocked Bieber's twitter account from their timelines," she said.
A Kiss FM announcer, Bea Lubis, said that she would probably cancel the ban, "if Bieber apologized in a sweet manner and promised not to say such things about Indonesia again."
Anggi said that the radio had yet to decide how long it would impose the ban.
