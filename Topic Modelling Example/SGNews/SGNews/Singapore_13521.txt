The Indonesian national dragonboat team dominated yesterday's inaugural DBS Marina Regatta, making a clean sweep in the international categories.
They crushed their opponents by more than a boat's length, cruising through Marina Bay to take the 500m Premier Open, Women's and Mixed races.
In all three races, Singapore's national dragonboat team came in second, with the Philippines' Team Triton-Onslaught third.
Almost 2,000 paddlers from about 95 teams took part in seven categories at the regatta, which was held at Marina Bay for the first time in 12 years.
After receiving their prizes from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was the guest of honour, Indonesia team manager Yang Mardinal said: "We were just lucky. It wasn't an easy race.
"We won because we had more practice. But we still need to have even more practice as we're pre- paring for the Asian Beach Games next month."
He added that the 10,000-strong crowd and the central location had spurred his charges to victory.
"Usually, such races are held outside of the city. But this one is right in the centre of the city, with a lot of people cheering us on. That made the teams want to do well even more," he explained.
Singapore's national team captain, Ang Zhi Hao, said of the heavily fancied Indonesians: "We expected them to win. We tried our best but it was difficult for us as we had to keep adapting our strategies to those of the Indonesians."
