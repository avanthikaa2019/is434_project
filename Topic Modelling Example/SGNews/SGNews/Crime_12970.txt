What two Swiss tourists thought was a goodwill gesture turned into horror when one of them was raped and the other molested, Mingguan Malaysia reported.
Ahead of the 2.20pm incident on Wednesday, the two women, both 25, had gone to the Thai consulate in Kota Baru after a vacation in Pulau Perhentian, Terengganu.
A man on a motorcycle saw them walking along Jalan Pintu Pong and offered to give them a lift back to their hotel.
Kota Baru OCPD Asst Comm Azham Othman told the paper that the man, however, took them to the Raja Perempuan Zainab II staff quarters where they had to wait for his friend.
A car with two men then came by and the two women were forced in.
The foreigners were taken to a bungalow where one of them was raped three times.
