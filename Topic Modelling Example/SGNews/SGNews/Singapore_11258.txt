There have been 35 cases of fallen windows from January to May this year, compared to 20 cases in the same period last year and in 2010, said a joint statement by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Housing Board (HDB) yesterday.
Since 2006, more than 70 per cent of all incidents have been due to poor window maintenance.
BCA said it will carry out window inspections in both private and HDB estates.
