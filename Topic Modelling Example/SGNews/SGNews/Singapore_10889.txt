The Anlene Bone Health Check booth at the Co-opaliciouz event was visited by President Tony Tan, highlighting the significance in raising awareness of bone health in Singapore and across Asia.
Anlene, Fonterra's brand of dairy products, has been providing free bone scanning in Singapore for over eight years.
The Fonterra team greeted the President at the event and explained how the painless ultrasound assessment provides information on bone health and bone quality.
Nurses were stationed at the Anlene booth to administer the scans and provide advice on how to maintain good bone health and reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis.
The Bone Health Checks at Saturday's event adds to more than 100,000 free scans already carried out across the island.
General Manager at Fonterra Brands Singapore, Mrs Rowena Danker, said: "Fonterra is committed to raising awareness of bone health across Asia and it is an honour to have the President come and see how the Anlene Bone Health Check is operated.
"The Anlene Bone Health Check has already helped hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans take preventive measures to protect their bone health and we're delighted to be able to continue this work at Co-opaliciouz - a significant national event that saw a turnout of 10,000 people."
Co-opaliciouz, an event organised by the Singapore National Co-operative Federation in conjunction with the United Nations' International year of Co-operatives, celebrates the contribution co-operatives make to the local community.
Since 2005, Fonterra has conducted more than five million bone scans in Asia and the Middle East as part of its research programme to raise awareness of the growing incidence of osteoporosis.
To date Fonterra has spent over US$50 million (S$64 million) on bone health research to increase its understanding of osteoporosis and the role of dairy in its prevention.
