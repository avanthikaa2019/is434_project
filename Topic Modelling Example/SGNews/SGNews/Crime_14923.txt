PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Police believe the bogus medium responsible for the death of three family members in Kajang is still in the country.
According to sources, the man who stays in an apartment, was employed as a security manager there for six months.
However, the management decided to terminate his services on March 31.
A day later, the man is believed to have poisoned the family of five in Kajang and fled with their jewellery and valuables.
It is learnt that since the incident, residents at the apartment have not seen him.
Relatives of the suspect claim they have not heard from him since he left their family home in Taman Seri Bahagia, Kuala Lumpur, following a disagreement over 10 years ago.
Police are looking for Murugan Krishnan, 42, to assist in investigations into the murder.
His last known address is 2-11 Vistana Mahkota, Jalan Pahlawan, Bandar Mahkota Cheras.
It was reported that a medium who claimed to be able to mend family disputes, allegedly poisoned the family by giving them milk laced with weedkiller on April 1.
Chargeman M. Karuppanan, 65, brought the medium to his home to help mend a family dispute between him and his eldest son Sargunan, 38.
His daughter K. Rajeswary, 28, died in hospital on April 4 while her brother Manivaran, 33, died four days later.
Their mother M. Sakunthala, 63, died on Saturday while Karuppanan and his other daughter Malathy, 32, who also consumed the tainted milk, have been discharged from hospital.
Anyone with information should contact ASP Pung Hing Chong at 019-449 9383 / 017-368 3893 or the nearest police station.
