KUANTAN - Six divers who went missing after a trip off Pulau Tioman have been found safe after 21 hours adrift at sea.
A local tugboat, Kencana Makmur, located and rescued the divers about 20 nautical miles north of Tulai Island, about 3km from Chebeh Island off Tioman, said Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) district enforcement chief Capt Abdul Aziz Idrus.
The six - Malaysians Yang Jia Xing, 26; Lim Kong Hooi, 27; Leong Li Kar, 26; and Maggie Lim, 27; Chinese national Xu Zhiming, 33; and Singaporean Hu Jin Jie, 25, - were rescued at 9am yesterday.
"Mersing Maritime Base informed our East Region Operations Centre at 4pm on Saturday that the divers have not returned from their dive at noon.
"We activated Kuantan's operations centre at 4.30pm and mounted a search and rescue operation," Capt Abdul Aziz said at the Kuantan MMEA headquarters yesterday.
