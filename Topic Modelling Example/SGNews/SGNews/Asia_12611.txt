MANILA - Two Philippine Air Force officers were feared dead after their plane crashed at the mouth of Manila Bay during a training mission on Friday.
The military has launched search-and-rescue operations for the pair on board the SF-260 trainer plane, said Lieutenant-Colonel Ernesto Okol, spokesman for the Philippine Air Force.
The aircraft plunged into the uninhabited island of La Monja, by Manila Bay, after taking off from a nearby air force base. The cause of the crash was unknown.
Rescuers retrieved a fuel tank, helmet and plane seat from the water but the two officers on board, a major and a lieutenant, remained missing, said provincial police spokesman Inspector Dennis Orbista.
The light propeller aircraft is one of a fleet of 18 purchased by the Philippines from Italy's Alenia Aermacchi in 1991 as part of the military's modernisation programme.
