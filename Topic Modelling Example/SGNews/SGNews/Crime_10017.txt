A total of 364 employers were caught hiring illegal foreign workers and 64 were hauled to court while 128 were slapped with fines.
The operations were carried out by the authorities after the 6P amnesty programme ended.
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Abu Seman Yusop (BN-Masjid Tanah) said 287,364 illegal foreign workers were registered for deportation. From that number, 161,843 had been sent back.
"The process for deportation takes a long time since travel documents for the illegals need to be prepared first," he said in reply to Fong Kui Lun (DAP-Bukit Bintang) on the illegal foreign workers who were registered under the 6P programme.
"Since the 6P programme started in August last year, more than 1.3 million foreigners had been registered.
"One million were given work permits to continue working here, while 287,364 were to be deported."
He said 536,000 illegal foreign workers employed by more than 100,000 employers had been legalised during the 6P programme. "There are 479,800 registered illegal foreign workers who have not gone through the legalisation process.
"Although the legalisation period ended in April, the interviews for employers are ongoing.
"That's why the ministry is urging employers to schedule an interview with the ministry and complete the process."
According to Immigration Department data, the number of legal foreign workers in the country is decreasing.
Last year, there were 1.5 million legal foreign workers compared with 1.8 million in 2010, 1.9 million in 2009 and more than two million in 2008.
