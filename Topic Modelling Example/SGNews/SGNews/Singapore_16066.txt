SINGAPORE - Nine autistic children were treated to a flight of a lifetime yesterday at Singapore's first and only indoor skydiving attraction.
iFly Singapore hosted the children - aged seven to 11 year olds - to commemorate World Autism Day on April 2, 2012.
The children were from Rainbow Centre Singapore and were chosen from the schools' over 190 students.
Founder of iFly Singapore, Mr Lawrence Koh, said: "It has always been my wish to bring flight to everyone to realise every child's dream of flying.
"I am glad that the children from Rainbow Centre were able to experience the joys of flight and defy gravity today.
"Indoor skydiving not only helps in confidence building but also increases a child's psychomotor skills," he added.
Happy to see the children apply what they learnt, Ms Sharifah Yokoyama said: "There is a misconception that children with autism do not like new experiences one way to assist them is to prepare them about their new experience so that they 'feel safe' about any new environment or experiences. With greater predictability, they will be more ready."
iFly also announced the launch of its Kids Flying Club yesterday in a separate press release, providing children an activity to stay active, make friends, improve their motor skills and boost confidence levels.
From 18 April 2012, children aged seven to 16 years old can fly at iFly Singapore every Wednesday and Sunday between 6 and 8pm at a discounted rate of S$685 for five flight sessions.
Each flight class will see between five and seven students being trained by a group of instructors on a rotation basis.
