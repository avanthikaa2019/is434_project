SINGAPORE - Work on the first phase of a 16km cycling network at Marina Bay has begun, said the Land Transport Authority yesterday.
The 2.5km cycling path along a section of Marina Boulevard, Bayfront Avenue and Marina Gardens Drive is expected to be completed by the first quarter of next year.
The rest of the cycling network in Marina Bay will be developed in tandem with the development of the area and is expected to be ready by 2014.
Certain sections of the cycling network along Marina Boulevard and Bayfront Avenue will be marked by distinctive metallic path markers with an embossed bicycle icon.
Placed at intervals, these markers provide a subtle segregation between the cycling path and the pedestrian walkway fronting some developments.
Similar markers have been used in Belgium and Spain.
