Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang will be in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, from tomorrow to Friday for a Group of 20 (G-20) meeting of trade ministers.
One of the key issues that will be discussed is supporting regional and global supply chains. Lowering unemployment rate is also on the agenda as the ministers will look into the links between trade and job creation.
The ministers will continue to ensure that the G-20 countries fulfill commitments to open up trade, such as rolling back tariff and non-tariff measures that have been put in place since the financial crisis.
The G-20 Trade Ministerial Meeting is held by Mexico, chair of G-20, as a lead-up to the G-20 Summit in June 2012.
G-20 consists of 19 permanent member countries of major economies and the European Union. The host country will send invites to other countries who are not permanent members to participate in the summits and meetings.
Officials from the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Singapore's Permanent Representative to the World Trade Organisation Kwok Fook Seng are accompanying Mr Lim.
