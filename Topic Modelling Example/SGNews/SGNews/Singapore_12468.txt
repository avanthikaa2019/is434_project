SINGAPORE - Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan would have been proud of how the residents of Block 11 at York Hill helped each other when the two fires hit over the past two days.
In his latest blog entry, Mr Khaw wrote that he hopes for a revival of community spirit among neighbours - the kind of spirit seen in the old kampung days.
"In the old kampung days, many families lived close to one another. Neighbours shared their everyday delights and looked out for one another's children. Every child was the community's child," he said.
"With modernisation, we lost a bit of this kampung spirit."
As an example, he brought up the recent fires in HDB towns and how they serve as a reminder that residents should be good neighbours and treat common spaces with respect.
To revive the old kampung spirit in the heartland, Mr Khaw said the inaugural Community Week will be launched next Monday.
He said: "During this Community Week, HDB will be targeting the youth, aiming to get young people more involved in their local communities.
"Through the various activities, young Singaporeans will learn about being considerate neighbours, doing good deeds for strangers and even becoming ambassadors for eco-living in their housing estates."
Mr Khaw also urged Singaporeans to be considerate neighbours so that we can "regain this old way of life".
He added: "This can be as simple as giving the uncle who walks by your corridor a simple smile or helping the aunty who struggles back home with her groceries."
