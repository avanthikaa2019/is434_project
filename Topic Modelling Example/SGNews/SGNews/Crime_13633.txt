KUANTAN, Malaysia - As a maid, 40-year-old Nanis Supardi was tasked with taking care of her employer's handicapped son, who is also bed-ridden.
Instead of giving full attention to the 11-year-old boy, the Indonesian maid had abused the boy including stepping on his face, neck, chest and stomach.
The mother of four also covered the victim's face with a piece of cloth before forcing the helpless boy to drink.
Nanis' cruel acts were recorded on a closed-circuit television camera and she was yesterday sentenced to four years' jail after pleading guilty to abusing the boy at her employer's home in Kampung Batu Hitam between 6pm and 6.30pm on March 13.
She was also sentenced to six months' jail after she pleaded guilty to overstaying as her social visit pass had expired on Feb 29.
The woman, from East Java, was expressionless, when Sessions Court judge Noradidah Ahmad meted out the sentence, which was translated into Javanese by a court interpreter.
When Noradida said her act was cruel as the victim could not even move, Nanis, only said that she khilaf (had made a mistake).
Nanis was unrepresented, while deputy public prosecutor Hidayatul Syuhada Shamsudin prosecuted.
In mitigation, Nanis pleaded for leniency as she had to support her children after she was divorced.
However, Hidayatul had pressed for a stiffer penalty arguing that Nanis, being a mother herself, should not have been so cruel to a child.
Noradidah ordered the jail sentences to run concurrently from the arrest date.
According to the facts, Nanis was hired barely a month before the incident, when she was alone with the victim.
The victim's mother suspected something amiss when she realised that her son was very weak and immediately checked the CCTV recording when she returned from work on March 13.
Shocked by what she discovered, the boy's mother lodged a police report and Nanis was arrested the same day.
