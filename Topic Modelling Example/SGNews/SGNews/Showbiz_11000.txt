Love the breathtaking beauty of the ocean? Then head down to East Coast Park's Dalbergia Green tomorrow for a free documentary screening, held in conjunction with World Oceans Day by WWF Singapore and its partners.
OceanWorld takes viewers on a voyage through Californian kelp forests, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and Roca Partida Island off the coast of Mexico, while creating awareness of the environmental challenges that they face.
The event kicks off at 6.30pm, and the nearest carparks are D1 and C4. Visit wwf.sg for more details.
