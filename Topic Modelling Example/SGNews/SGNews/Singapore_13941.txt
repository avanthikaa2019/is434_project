Nearly 13,600 people turned up at the Istana Open House on Labour Day yesterday.
About 8,600 were Singaporeans and permanent residents, while the rest were foreigners.
It was President Tony Tan Keng Yam's third Open House since he took office.
The President and his wife, Mrs Mary Tan, were ferried around in buggies, stopping at several pit stops to greet visitors.
Among them was housewife Rekha Devaraj, 28. She was at the Istana with her husband and their four-month-old son.
"My husband and I came to see the President's house, and it was a pleasant surprise when we got to meet the President himself," Mrs Devaraj said.
The Open House event also saw performances by groups such as River Valley High School Concert Band and U Live Community's Music Makers Club.
Visitors got to see several species of birds showcased by the Jurong Bird Park and could choose to get their faces painted by make-up artists from Cosmoprof Academy.
