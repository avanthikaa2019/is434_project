"People are angry for valid reasons. Some of the foreigners take our laws for granted." - Mr Samuel Leem, 24, student
"Respect begets respect. Many foreigners are using Singapore as a stepping stone. We have to make a stand."
- Mr Paul Seah, 35, civil servant
"Probably not, look at YouTube and you realise China's accidents are very similar. If they (Chinese) come here, they have to follow the law.
I suggest that these foreigners take driving lessons here, like regular Singaporeans, because different countries have different driving courses. - Mr Ben Ong,52, self-employed
We asked 50 people
"I think the accident showed the insecurities we have about foreigners. It's not fair to latch on to this accident as a way of voicing our displeasure with them."
- Mr Andrew Yeo, 35, salesman
"It's sad that people online are focusing on the Ferrari driver's nationality and associating it with high-profile foreigner incidents.
For example, Sun Xu (a Chinese student who mocked Singaporeans in a blog post) and the guy who knocked down the cleaner at Changi Airport." -Ms Wong Wei Ling, 28, marketing executive
"They need to be more rational and substantiate (their claims) instead of blindly flaming foreigners for the sake of it. Foreigners might be responsible for a disproportionate number of such incidents, but that doesn't mean it's fair to tar all of them with the same brush." - Mr Lim Jia Wei, 20, student
"The criticism is not unfounded, but some of the posts are utterly disgraceful." - Mr J Rajasingam, 62, businessman
