The US Federal Aviation Administration began an investigation over an alleged UFO sighting that nearly caused a plane crash, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
A private pilot in Denver told authorities on Monday that his aircraft had a near-collision with a large, unidentified aircraft that was not detected on radar.
The incident prompted the FAA to launch a probe over the mysterious object. Investigators will talk to the pilot and look at other clues to find out what the object.
While the aircraft was dubbed a UFO by several media sources, analysts say it was something much more mundane; probably a remote-controlled plane, surveillance drone or large bird.
However, some point out that the incident took place at an altitude of more than 2,400 meters and RC airplanes hardly ever fly that high, and drones would have been picked up by radar.
An FAA official said that the agency will find out what the object was and who was controlling it.
