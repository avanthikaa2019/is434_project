SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will conduct the Comprehensive Labour Force Survey from tomorrow until July 31, which will involve 33,000 households.
The purpose of the annual survey is to collect data on employment, unemployment and other economic characteristics of the population to help in the planning and formulation of manpower-related policies and programmes.
It will be conducted by MOM's Manpower Research and Statistics Department.
MOM will notify households selected for the survey by post.
Households with Internet access are encouraged to participate via the Manpower Survey Online System (MSOL), which provides a fast, safe and convenient means for households to submit information.
Households which prefer not to participate via MSOL can provide their contact details to MOM for telephone interviews through the survey hotline on 6592-1067 from Monday to Friday, from 8.30am to 5.30pm.
If MOM is unable to reach the households via telephone, its interviewers will conduct personal visits.
All interviewers will display identification cards issued by MOM.
Households can verify their identities by calling the MOM Contact Centre on 6438-5122.
