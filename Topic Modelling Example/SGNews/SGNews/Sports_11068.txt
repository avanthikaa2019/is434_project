Newly crowned Sportswoman of the Year, Fu Mingtian, will have the easiest opening tie among Singapore shuttlers, at the June 19 to 24 Li-Ning Singapore Open at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
The South-East Asia Games gold medallist will begin her Li-Ning Singapore Open with a first-round tie against a qualifier, after yesterday's tournament draw.
However, Gu Juan, Singapore's Olympic-bound women's badminton player, faces a trickier opener against Porntip Buranaprasertsuk.
The Thai shuttler is ranked just a spot below the Singaporean world No.16, but has beaten Gu in three of their five previous encounters.
Singapore's Olympic-bound men's shuttler, Derek Wong, will have to battle his way through the qualifiers. Should he manage to do so, he will meet fourth-seed Simon Santoso of Indonesia.
Compatriot Ashton Chen faces an even tougher opponent, should he make it out of his qualifying draw: He will face China's top representative, Wang Zhengming.
In the women's doubles, 2010 Singapore Open champions, Shinta Mulia Sari and Yao Lei, will face a new Malaysian pairing of Vivian Hoo and Woon Khe Wei, in their opening tie.
"We want to do our best at this event, in front of our home supporters. Of course, winning in Singapore again this year would be a dream come true for us," said Yao.
Japan's Sho Sasaki, the men's singles top seed, will face Denmark's Viktor Axelsen, while women's top seed Jiang Yanjiao of China will face a qualifier
