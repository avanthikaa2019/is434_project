HONG KONG - Renowned Hong Kong actress and singer, Karen Mok, has been officially welcomed as the newest celebrity fan for Mandarin Oriental's award-winning campaign.
The campaign, "He's a Fan/She's a Fan", is designed to raise the hotel group's brand awareness by globally connecting 'the fan' with international celebrities who regularly stay at its hotels.
The group's portrait photographer, Mary McCartney, photographs each celebrity in a location of their choice that best represents a feeling of well-being for them.
Ms Mok was photographed in Milan, outside the historic Casa Degli Omenoni where she has been a big fan of the city ever since she was a student there.
She has expressed her delight that Mandarin Oriental is opening a hotel in the city in 2013.
Her photograph is featured at the Hong Kong's City Hall site as Mandarin Oriental's 'Brand New Fan' in the group's outdoor advertising campaign.
At a press conference at Hong Kong's Mandarin Oriental, Ms Mok was presented with a signed copy of her photograph for the campaign.
Jill Kluge, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group's Director of Brand Communications, said that having Karen as part of their campaign was delightful as she is a Hong Kong born, internationally renowned performer.
"Her phenomenal talent and grace is well known and she will be an asset to our award-winning campaign.
"By focusing on celebrities who clearly appreciate the finer things in life, we have been able to show the quality of our hotels in a far more interesting way than traditional hotel advertising", said Ms Kluge.
The group also makes a donation to each celebrity's individual choice of charity as an appreciation of support.
Ms Mok's charity of choice is Animals Asia Foundation.
Ms Mok joins Mandarin Oriental's 23 existing fans such as Kevin Spacey, Christian Louboutin, Sophie Marceau, IM Pei and Michelle Yeo, amongs others.
