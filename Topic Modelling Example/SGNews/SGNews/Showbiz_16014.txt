Popular girl group KARA announced on Tuesday they will launch their first signature fragrance, becoming the first Asian celebrity to introduce a cosmetic product named after them and created with their input.
"We have been working for a long time on developing K5J and are so excited that our signature fragrance is now a reality," said KARA members in a statement.
"We wanted our fragrance to be truly special, and created K5J to bring us even closer to our fans," they said.
The perfume named "Kara 5 Jewel," or "K5J," will hit the shelves first in Japan on April 14 and will debut at stores in other parts of Asia including Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and Taiwan in the summer, Three Cups Yard, a design and investment firm, said.
The five-member group sold more than 1.18 million albums in Japan in 2011. Their hit songs in Japan include "Super Girl" and "Step."
"KARA have established themselves as a powerhouse in Asian entertainment and a role model for their fans across the globe," Three Cups Yard, a Singapore-based company, said.
"The natural beauty and enthusiasm that radiates from within each member makes KARA a perfect choice for us," it added.
The KARA fragrance was created in Paris in partnership with 3CY, a lifestyle brand owned by Three Cups Yard.
Manufactured in the United Kingdom, the fragrance has fruity, floral and woody notes, it said.
The company plans to launch more celebrity fragrances in the future with hallyu stars who have established fandom around the world.
