SINGAPORE - The National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC) announced today a new two-year term of office, with 14 new members joining the 25 member council.
Eleven members were re-appointed for continuity, the council said. New members on the council include a business consultant and an academic.
Chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the NPCEC oversees and drives the national effort to boost productivity.
DPM Tharman said, "For the new term, we have brought more members into the NPCEC, to add diverse perspectives, including from SMEs and the services sector."
The council, formed in April 2010, comprises members from the unions, and the private and public sectors.
Through a sector-based strategy, it aims to improve national productivity by two to three per cent per annum over the next 10 years.
Following the initial identification of 12 priority sectors, the council has since completed 11 productivity roadmaps, it said.
Early this year, the Council also identified four new sectors of interest - namely, process construction &amp; maintenance, financial services, accountancy and social services.
This brings the total number of sectors identified by NPCEC to 16, covering about 55 per cent of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 60 per cent of employment.
The NPCEC has also mounted the nation-wide public outreach effort Way To Go, Singapore! to bring home to workers and companies the benefits of productivity enhancements in the workplace.
