Criminal charges in a notorious case of a Taiwanese man suspected of illegal possession of six foetuses will be depend on autopsy results.
If the bodies' lungs showed signs of respiration the man could face a murder charge, otherwise the cases would be abortion-related, a police general who heads the Institute of Forensic Medicine said yesterday.
The results could also determine the causes of their death, whether they were prematurely taken out of their mothers' wombs, while the DNA of the foetuses would also be checked to help identify who their parents were, Pol Maj General Somboon Tantrakool said.
The chief of Phabphla Chai police, Colonel Rungroj Sayanprasert who leads the probe, said legal interpretations over the condition of the foetuses and whether they had signs of life must coincide with public prosecutors' decision on what charge the suspect should be indicted on. "Indicting the suspect on the wrong charge could be result in him being set free," he said. Two of the six foetuses had the potential to show signs of life.
Police sources quoted details from questioning of suspect Chow Hok Kuen, 28. He had allegedly entered Thailand 16 times since 2008, when he bought two foetuses on his first trip, they said. He later allegedly put foetuses into luggage loaded into cargo compartments instead of a carry-on bag to avoid detection when flying out of Thailand.
Chow bought the bodies from hospitals, temples and clinics that illegally performed abortions, mostly in Samut Prakan, at an average price of Bt30,000, police alleged. They had learnt of a few locations but could not tell where they were.
