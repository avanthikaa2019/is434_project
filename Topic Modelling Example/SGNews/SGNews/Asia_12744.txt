A total of about 5,100 potentially dangerous gaps have been found between guardrails and roadside structures on expressways managed by three companies in eastern, central and western regions of Japan, the transport minister said Tuesday.
The roadside structures include noise-blocking walls such as the one involved in the April 29 tour bus accident on the Kanetsu Expressway that killed seven passengers.
Inspections conducted after that accident by the three operators of the expressways at the instruction of the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry revealed the 5,100 gaps.
The ministry will request East Nippon Expressway Co., Central Nippon Expressway Co. and West Nippon Expressway Co. to close the gaps, starting with those on curves, by such measures as extending guardrails.
The tour bus accident happened at a place on the expressway where a 10-centimeter-long gap existed between the guardrail and the roadside noise-blocking wall.
Investigators found that the bus crashed into the noise barrier after hitting the guardrail.
