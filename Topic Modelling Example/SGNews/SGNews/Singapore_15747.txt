Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen visited the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Peace Carvin (PC) V F-15SG fighter detachment at the Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB) in Idaho on Saturday.
He was there as part of his introductory visit to the US.
The PC V detachment is home to about 180 RSAF personnel, comprising pilots, Weapons Systems Officers (Fighter) and ground crew.
Dr Ng, who was accompanied by Commander of the USAF's 366th Fighter Wing Colonel Ronald Buckley and Commander of the RSAF's Fighter Group Colonel Ho Foo Sing, visited detachment facilities and was briefed on its training programme.
Dr Ng also interacted with RSAF personnel and their families who were stationed at MHAFB, as well as members of the MHAFB leadership and local community leaders.
The RSAF F-15SG detachment was inaugurated in 2009, marking a key milestone in the RSAF's development of its advanced fighter capabilities to deliver more effective air power for the third generation SAF.
Detachments and training in the US and other overseas locations allow the RSAF to overcome airspace constraints in Singapore.
Under the PC programme, the RSAF has an F-16C/D fighter detachment (PC II) at the Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, which was established in 1992.
The RSAF also has two other training detachments in the US: the Peace Prairie CH-47D Chinook helicopter detachment in Grand Prairie, Texas, and the Peace Vanguard AH-64D Apache helicopter detachment in Marana, Arizona.
These training arrangements enable the SAF to build up its operational capabilities and readiness, and are testament to the excellent and long-standing bilateral defence relations between Singapore and US.
