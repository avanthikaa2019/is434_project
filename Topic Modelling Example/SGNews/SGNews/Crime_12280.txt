A Singaporean man and a West African women were arrested for alleged drug trafficking in two separate operations on Monday afternoon.
Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers seized a total of 2.9kg of Ice and 450 grammes of heroin, valued at $644,800.
In the first operation, a 28-year-old West African woman was arrested at around 3pm at the arrival hall of Changi Airport Terminal 1.
CNB officers found two boxes containing 12 lead pistons in a check-in nylon baggage. Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority officers also spotted abnormalities in the x-ray images of the pistons being scanned.
Officers then prised open the pistons and found packets of crystalline substances, believed to be Ice, hidden in each piston.
The Ice found is this year's largest seizure to date and is worth more than half a million of dollars.
The woman, who had with her about eight different currencies, was immediately placed under arrest and is being investigated for drug importation. She might face the death penalty if found guilty.
On the same afternoon, CNB officers intercepted a car at a junction in Bukit Batok West and arrested a 38-year-old Singaporean man after a short chase.
During the chase, the suspect had attempted to throw away a blue plastic bag containing two brown envelopes of heroin.
A small amount of Ice was also found on the floor mat of the front passenger seat of the car.
The suspect is being investigated for drug trafficking and might face the death penalty if convicted.
