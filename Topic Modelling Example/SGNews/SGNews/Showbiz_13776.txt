It looked glamorous on TV - local celebs arriving at Star Awards Show 2, held at Marina Bay Sands on Sunday, by boat.
But what happened behind the scenes was another story.
Current affairs presenters Lim Yi Chyi and Iriana Halim had already stepped off the river taxi onto the wooden platform.
But because the cameras didn't catch them doing so, both ladies had to wobble back onto the boat in their high heels for a retake.
Up on the uneven platform, news presenter Wang Zheng also accidentally stepped on fellow anchor Tung Soo Hua's gown.
Worse, local actress Adeline Lim nearly tripped.
Let's just stick to the good ol' red carpet next year, shall we?
