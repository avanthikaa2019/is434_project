GALLOWAY, New Jersey - Stacy Lewis carded a second-straight six-under par 65 on Saturday to seize a six-shot lead going into the final round of the LPGA ShopRite Classic.
Lewis, who shared the overnight lead with Japan's Mika Miyazato, had a 36-hole total of 12-under par 130, matching the tournament record set by Amy Benz in 1996 and matched by Denise Killeen in 2004.
She had comfortable cushion in the 54-hole event over Sweden's Anna Nordqvist, who posted a four-under 67 for 136. Nordqvist's six birdies included three in a row from the 11th.
Paula Creamer and So Yeon Ryu, the last two winners of the US women's Open, were in a group on 137.
Ryu carded a 67 on the Bay Course at the Seaview resort, while Creamer posted a 70. They were joined at five-under by Australian Katherine Hull, who posted a 66 and Spain's Azahara Munoz, who carded a 68.
World number one Yani Tseng was in a quartet of players on 138. The Taiwanese star, winner of the three tournaments already this season, carded a 67 and was tied with South Korea's Hee-Won Han (67), Colombia's Mariajo Uribe (71) and Miyazato, who slipped back with a two-over 73.
Tseng teed off on 10 and made a move with four straight birdies around the turn, starting at 18 and continuing at the first, second and third holes.
Her charge stalled with bogeys at four and seven, but she capped her round with a birdie on the par-five ninth.
