ROME - About 3,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in northeast Italy's Emilia Romagna region, where a magnitude 6.0 quake struck early Sunday killing at least six, civil defence services said.
Most were evacuated from the Modena area, while 500 were asked to leave their homes in the area around Ferrara.
Authorities were also forced to evacuate 500 detainees from the prison in Ferrara.
Meanwhile, a new strong quake struck the centre of Sant'Agostino of Ferrara at around 1300 GMT, leading to the collapse of another part of the town hall which already had several gaping holes. The quake was also felt in Bologna and Milan.
The earlier fatal 6.0-magnitude quake was registered at 0204 GMT.
Authorities said its epicentre was the commune of Finale Emilia, 36 kilometres (22 miles) north of Bologna, at a depth of only 5.1 kilometres (3.2 miles).
