BEIJING - Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng told AFP on Sunday that he was still in a Beijing hospital but had asked government officials to help him apply to go abroad.
"Now I have notified the hospital to invite them (government officials) to help me do the procedures. I really don't have a way," he said by telephone, adding his injuries and limits on his movements had confined him to hospital.
China's foreign ministry said on Friday that he would be allowed to apply to study abroad, signalling then-visiting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had secured a deal with the Chinese government.
Chen is at the centre of a major diplomatic wrangle between China and the United States after he dramatically escaped harsh house arrest in the eastern province of Shandong and sought refuge at the US embassy in Beijing.
He was escorted to the hospital by US officials on Wednesday after being holed up inside the embassy for six days, but later had a change of heart, saying he wanted to leave China for his safety.
Speaking from his hospital bed, Chen said his foot was in a plaster cast which made it difficult for him to leave the hospital to carry out the necessary procedures to leave the country.
But he added his friends had been barred from visiting and US diplomats had only been allowed to see his wife, who was with him in the hospital.
"They (US diplomats) have come, but they can't see me," he said.
Friends of the dissident, who exposed forced abortions, told AFP Chen was preparing to go to the United States and might leave soon though his departure would depend on the Chinese government.
