CAIRO - Egyptians began voting on Wednesday in the nation's first genuine presidential election that will pick the man to replace Hosni Mubarak who was ousted in a popular uprising last year.
Polling stations opened at 8am (0600 GMT), television reported. They will close at 8pm (1800 GMT). With none of the 12 candidates bidding for Egypt's top job expected to win the first round outright, a second round is planned for mid-June.
