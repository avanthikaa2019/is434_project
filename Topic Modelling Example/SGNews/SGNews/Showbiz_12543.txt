ASIAN action hero Jackie Chan announced his retirement from action films at the recent Cannes Festival.
The Hong Kong actor said that people never believe him when he says he is going to retire, but Chan told the Associated Press (AP) that: "I have to stop one day."
But the good news is, the 58-year-old is not going to stop acting entirely.
Taking his cue from Hollywood actors like Robert DeNiro and Clint Eastwood, he said that he will continue to make films with more acting than action.
At Cannes, he also launched his final action movie, Chinese Zodiac, in which his character searches for the 12 bronze heads of the Chinese zodiac.
He co-stars with Kwone Sang Woo, Yao Xingtong and Liao Fan.
AP reported that the film was written, produced and directed by Chan. He also had a hand in coordinating fights scenes for the film.
Will Chinese Zodiac pack a punch?
