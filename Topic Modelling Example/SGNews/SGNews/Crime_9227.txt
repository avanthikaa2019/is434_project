Two men and a woman were arrested for their involvement in a series of cheating cases involving pawning of fake gold jewellery.
Since June 2012, the police received reports of a spate of cheating cases involving a 39-year-old male suspect.
In these cases, the suspect would visit various pawnshops and pawn fake gold jewellery as genuine in return for cash.
In most cases, only some of the jewellery was genuine.
Following these reports, a crime alert was sent to the Sinagpore Pawnbrokers' Association and more cases were surfaced.
The police detained a 29-year-old woman and 30-year-old man believed to be linked to the cases reported.
The female suspect also had fake jewellery in her possession.
The 39-year-old mastermind was eventually arrested on June 28.
Preliminary investigations indicated that the trio is believed to be involved in at least 15 cases of cheating involving about $60,000.
The 39-year-old will be charged in court on June 30 for cheating, which carries a maximum jail term of up to 10 years. Investigations in the cases against the other two suspects are ongoing.
The police advise pawnshop proprietors to be vigilant against a similar ruse and to exercise due diligence to check and verify the identities of individuals who pawn items at their premises as well as their guarantors before parting with their money.
Where possible, pawnshop owners are also encouraged to carry out detailed examination on the pawned items.
