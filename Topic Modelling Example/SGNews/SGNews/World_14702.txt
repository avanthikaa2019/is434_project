WARSAW - A hundred kilogrammes (220.5 pounds) of cocaine have been found in a shipment of bananas delivered to two hypermarkets owned by France's Auchan chain in southern Poland, local media reported Friday.
"An investigation is underway. I can offer no other comment on the matter," Auchan's spokesperson in Poland Dorota Patejko told AFP Friday.
Police also told AFP Friday they were not commenting "for the moment".
The narcotics were discovered early this week in the supermarkets in southern Poland's Katowice and Raciborz, according to the website of the Gazeta Wyborcza daily.
Last month a 30-kilogrammes haul of cocaine was discovered in a banana ripening warehouse in the south-eastern town of Zgorzelec, on Poland's eastern border with Germany.
Those drugs were thought to have arrived from Ecuador via Belgium in a shipment that was sent "by mistake" to Poland, said the Polish PAP news agency quoting local police.
