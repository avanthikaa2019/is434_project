The police is seeking to confiscate the assets of those who offered to help applicants cheat in the recent police-recruitment examination. "Our investigation is progressing well and this week we will focus on asset seizure," National Police Office spokesman Maj-General Piya Utayo said yesterday.
According to Provincial Police Region 3 deputy commissioner Maj-General Jaktip Holasutasakul, 13 suspects have already been arrested for allegedly providing exam-cheating services.
Pol Snr Sergeant-Major Wachiranusorn Pongpan and Pol Sergeant Prasarn Wongcha have also been found involved and will be suspended from duty soon.
"There are two other suspects on the run as well," Jaktip said.
The police force held recruitment exams in many regions on June 10 to fill vacancies for non-commissioned staff and many of the applicants were found carrying devices that were allegedly used to indicate answers.
Piya said the police force would hold a new examination with new questions.
"We will also use some technology in a bid to prevent any more cheating," he said.
In Nakhon Ratchasima, a suspect in the cheating scam told police that he had not received anything from the alleged service providers.
"I just met one of the gang members and she promised that she would help my relatives secure a post in the police force," Boonjan Kosarnkhun, 41, said.
He said as many as 21 of his relatives had sought to use the services offered by this gang, which demanded between Bt300,000 and Bt500,000.
"I've heard that thousands have used the services of this gang. The applicants don't need to pay the entire fee right away," he said.
