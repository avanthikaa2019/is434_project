Two individuals - a 14-year-old youth and a 32-year-old man - have been arrested for suspected loansharking activities in two separate cases.
In the first case, a 32-year-old man believed to be a debtor-turned-runner was arrested on May 24 in the vicinity of Dover Rise.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect has assisted the loanshark syndicates to procure ATM cards from other debtors and used them to perform electronic funds transactions via ATMs. Upon his arrest, two ATM cards and one mobile phone containing suspected debtors' records were seized in connection to the case.
In the second case, a male 14-year-old youth was arrested in the vicinity of Woodlands Ave 1 on May 24.
Three cans of paint, one marker pen and one note containing suspected debtors' addresses were seized in connection to the case.
Investigations against both suspects are ongoing.
First-time offenders found guilty of loanshark harassment shall be fined not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000 with mandatory imprisonment of up to five years and mandatory caning of up to six strokes.
Those found guilty of assisting in the carrying on of the business of an unlicensed moneylender for the first time, may be fined not less than $30,000 and not more than $300,000, be imprisoned for a term not exceeding four years and shall also be liable to be punished with caning of not more than six strokes.
