SINGAPORE - A despatch driver was jailed four weeks for offering a $100 bribe to a cop, in exchange for not issuing him a ticket for using his mobile phone while driving.
Lim Kim Seng, 68, pleaded guilty to corruptly offering the amount to Coporal Ng Ching Heng along Thomson Road on July 6, 2011.
He was also fined $800 and banned from driving for four months.
Lim was caught driving while using the phone at about 3.25pm that day.
Cpl Ng was patrolling the area when he saw Lim steering his lorry with his left hand while holding the phone to his ear with his right hand.
After being pulled over, Lim pleaded with Cpl Ng not to issue him with a summons and offered him a $100 note, saying 'Tolong bu yao saman' (Please, do not summon).
Lim could have been fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years for corruption.
The maximum penalty for using a mobile phone while driving is a $1,000 fine and six months' jail.
