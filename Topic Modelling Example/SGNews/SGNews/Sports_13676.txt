VIENNA - Aeronautics fans from 70 countries are competing in Salzburg, Austria over the next two days for the coveted world title... in paper plane flying.
The lucky 249 "pilots", who were selected among 35,000 participants in some 600 qualification rounds worldwide, will face off in three disciplines: longest distance, longest airtime and aerobatics.
Regulations require that the planes be made out of a single A4 sheet of paper using no tools - such as scissors or glue - except in the aerobatics category.
A jury will then assess the performances based on Paper Aircraft Association (PAA) regulations.
Aside from being crown world champion, the paper plane pilots will be hoping to break new records, currently at 63.19 metres (207 feet and four inches) for distance, and 27.9 seconds for airtime.
This is the third edition of the Red Bull Paper Wings World Final, which was already held in 2006 and 2009.
