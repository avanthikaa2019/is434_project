ROME - A friendly football match between Italy and Luxembourg scheduled to take place in Parma on Tuesday was called off after a strong earthquake hit the region, killing at least 12 people.
The match was part of preparations for next month's European Football Championships in Poland and Ukraine and was called off by the Italian Football Federation and local authorities.
Italy coach Cesare Prandelli said there were more important things in life than a football match.
"There are situations that make you think and make you realise there are worse things in life (than cancelling a game)," he told Rai.
A federation spokesman told AFP that the match would not be moved elsewhere or postponed to a later date.
Italy still have another friendly to come on Friday against Russia in Zurich before opening their Euro 2012 campaign against Spain on June 10.
