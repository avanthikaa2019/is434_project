As part of its water network enhancement works, PUB, the national water agency, will be shutting down a water pipeline along Tampines Expressway (TPE) from April 23 to 26, 2012.
The pipeline supplies water to customers residing in Tampines, Pasir Ris, Loyang/Changi and parts of Bedok.
Water supply to these areas will not be affected as water will be supplied through an alternative source during the course of the work.
The works will involve emptying the water pipeline to facilitate the installation of new flow meters which can provide real time information on the amount of water flowing through the pipe. This will enhance monitoring and management of the water supply network, as well as facilitate operational planning and forecasting.
When the works are completed and the pipeline is being filled up, tiny air bubbles may form in the water due to the change in water pressure, hence creating a milky appearance when the water is collected from taps. The water will become clear when left to stand for a few minutes - a phenomenon similar to fizzy canned drinks. PUB wishes to assure all customers that the air bubbles do not affect water quality and the water remains safe for drinking.
To report changes in water supply or for further assistance, members of the public can call the PUB-One 24-hour toll-free hotline at 1800-2846600.
