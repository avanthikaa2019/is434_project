SINGAPORE - The court fined a woman $4,000 for stabbing her husband while he was warded in hospital for an earlier attack by four assailants.
Quek Chin Fern, 38, was visiting her husband, Mr Lim Peng Kiang, 40, at Ward 43 of the Singapore General Hospital on Sept 22 last year, when she stabbed him on his left shoulder, neck and cheek.
Mr Lim was warded for acid burn injuries.
The attack was triggered by an argument, after Quek started talking about Mr Lim's acts of unfaithfulness and the problems he had brought to the family, reported The Straits Times.
This irritated Mr Lim, and the couple got into an argument.
Quek, who is unemployed, took out a knife from her bag and struck Mr Lim several times.
In mitigation, the mother of two was found by a doctor at the Institute of Mental Health to be suffering from depression for more than 10 years.
Her husband, who has recovered, is also supportive of her as he felt responsible for the assault.
