Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law K Shanmugam visited Sri Lanka between May 29 and June 1, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).
Mr Shanmugam visited Trincomalee, a port city in the Eastern Province, and Jaffna, the capital city of the Northern Province. He met the Governors of the provinces and other local leaders in both cities.
He also visited the Prima Flour Mill. Prima is the largest Singapore-based investor in Sri Lanka, and has been established in Trincomalee since 1977.
In Jaffna, a province that is slowly recovering from the decades-long conflict, Mr Shanmugam was briefed on the ongoing reconstruction and development efforts. He said that Singapore would be happy to consider some technical assistance in capacity building, such as skills upgrading and teacher-training in computer literacy.
Mr Shanmugam visited the iconic Jaffna Public Library ,which suffered extensive destruction during the civil war and has since been rebuilt. Last year, Singapore contributed a project to refurbish the children's section of the library and provided training of Jaffna librarians.
Minister Shanmugam also went to a village which resettled displaced persons, as well as the Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil, a historically significant Hindu temple that remains an important religious and social institution in Jaffna today.
In Colombo, Mr Shanmugam reaffirmed Singapore's commitment to further bilateral cooperation and wished Sri Lanka well as it undertook efforts towards national reconciliation.
Mr Shanmugam and Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen also jointly witnessed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Singapore Business Federation and the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce aimed at stepping up greater economic exchanges.
