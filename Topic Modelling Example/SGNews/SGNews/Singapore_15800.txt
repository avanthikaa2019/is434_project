Local maid agencies are calling for clearer guidelines on the mandatory day off for foreign domestic workers.
A local news source said some agencies have asked for clearer definitions of a rest day, such as the number of hours allowed.
This is to ensure a smooth introduction of the new law next year.
Under the new regulations, employers and their maids are free to mutually decide which day of the week the rest day falls on.
But some agencies raised examples of maids following their employers on weekend leisure activities and questioned whether such activities constituted rest days.
They also said there should be a mediation mechanism when disputes arise so that there will be guidelines on how to deal with them.
A maid agency director said disputes are bound to happen between employers and their domestic workers, hence, the government should let them know who they can turn to for mediation.
The new regulations state that maid agencies are not supposed to interfere in disputes.
However, maid agencies agreed that flexibility is needed when employers and maids negotiate so that there will be a harmonious relationship between them.
Maid agencies also told a local news source that they will be stricter in choosing foreign domestic workers so that only those who are serious about working in Singapore are brought in.
This would hopefully reduce employers' concerns about the implications of the new law, they said.
