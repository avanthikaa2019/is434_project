Passengers were warned of potential delays yesterday, while national carrier Royal Brunei Airlines enhances its sytem at the Brunei International Airport.
RBA announced yesterday that it will be enhancing its system at the Brunei International Airport on April 17 and April 24, and passengers travelling from the country's capital may experience delays during check-in due to the system migrations.
A press statement from RBA yesterday said that the system enhancements will be implemented for passengers travelling to Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Melbourne from April 17.
Further system enhancements for all RBA scheduled flights will take place on April 24.
"We apologise for any inconvenience caused to passengers during this time. Once the new system is in place, passengers will be able to enjoy a smoother check-in process," said Tommy Koh Huey Ming, the RBA's Head of Management Information System (MIS) in the statement.
RBA will attempt to minimise these delays, including assigning designated counters at the Business Class check-in area for passengers travelling to the above destinations. The company encouraged passengers to arrive at the airport early to ensure sufficient time for check-in.
RBA has recently selected the Amadeus Alt&eacute;a Suite as its future platform for Passenger Service Systems (PSS).
This includes reservations, inventory and airport check-in as well as other systems in a comprehensive technology agreement.
The system will be fully implemented May 2012.
