If you have bought a pair of special glasses to observe Monday's annular solar eclipse, don't throw them away after the moon has passed in front of the sun--a second celestial event is set to follow next month.
On June 6, Venus will pass in front of the sun, a smaller "eclipse" that will be visible in many parts of the nation.
This phenomenon last occurred in June 2004, and will not occur again for 105 years. The rare celestial event happens when Earth and Venus align with the sun.
Around 7:10 a.m. on June 6 in Tokyo, Venus will appear like a small mole on the upper left of the sun's face, and will gradually slide to the lower right.
Around 1:47 p.m., about 6-1/2 hours later, Venus will leave the sun's face.
The event will be observable at roughly the same time in many parts of the nation.
As directly looking at the sun with the naked eye or through a telescope during an eclipse can cause eye damage, solar glasses or viewers are recommended for safe viewing.
On the day, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and science museums nationwide plan to hold observation events.
