Golden Village (GV) has become the latest cinema chain to reveal that all 10 of its cineplexes are monitored by closed- circuit TV (CCTV) cameras.
GV was unable to say where exactly the cameras were installed "due to security reasons".
But a spokesman did say that "they are installed for general surveillance and safety purposes".
Other reasons include monitoring the situation in case of emergencies such as fires.
The latest cameras were installed at GV Katong in East Coast Road last December.
my paper reported on Monday that, over the last two years, film-distributor and movie-theatre chain Shaw Theatres installed CCTVs in all its newly established and renovated multiplexes, such as JCube and Lido.
Shaw said that it has plans to install CCTVs in all seven of its multiplexes.
The cameras are installed mainly to combat piracy, and they have helped police investigations in one case.
Leisure and entertainment group Cathay Organisation Holdings also said that it has installed cameras on its premises, especially at entrances, exits and in projection rooms.
Mr Don Yang, 29, owner of security-service provider Quantum Zeno Solutions, said the cameras in Shaw cinemas appear capable of capturing video footage (that is, they do not just capture still pictures), and are capable of zooming in and out.
WE Cinemas, formerly known as Eng Wah Cinemas, and FilmGarde were unable to reply by press time if CCTVs are installed in their cinemas.
"Cameras in cinemas are good for safety reasons.
They can deter people from recording movies and even detect perverts," said movie-goer Deryn Tjoandi, 22, a private tutor.
