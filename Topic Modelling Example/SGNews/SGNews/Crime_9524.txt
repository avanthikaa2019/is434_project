Police have arrested three males and three females, aged between 9 and 17 years, who are believed to have broken into a provision shop located at Holland Close.
The 51-year-old victim reported the housebreaking on the afternoon of June 24. Cash amounting to about $1,800 was found missing.
With the aid of CCTV's footage obtained from the shop, the officers managed to establish the identity of the first suspect, a 12-year-old female, and placed her under arrest.
Through follow up investigations, her five other accomplices were also arrested in the vicinity of Commonwealth Crescent.
The three suspects were believed to have gained entry into the provision shop via the rear door with stolen keys while the rest of the suspects acted as lookouts.
Investigations are still ongoing.
Anyone convicted of housebreaking and theft by night with common intention faces a jail term which may extend to 14 years.
