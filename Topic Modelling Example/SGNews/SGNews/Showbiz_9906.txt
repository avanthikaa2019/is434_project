There might have been something inherently difficult to translate to the big screen, as far as Rachel Klein's 2002 novel is concerned.
Or there is something that director Mary Harron missed, despite her notable credentials (she previously helmed American Psycho).
Despite strong acting by Sarah Bolger and Lily Cole, this gothic tale exploring suspected vampirism and intense female friendships in an all-girls boarding school builds up suspense but fails to satisfy with its ending.
THE MOTH DIARIES (M18) Horror/82 minutes Rating: 2.5/5 stars
