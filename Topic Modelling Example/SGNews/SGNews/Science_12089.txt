SINGAPORE - Grey Singapore has conducted the country's first Twitter research on what makes Singaporeans happy.
According to the Happiness Report 2.0, happiness levels among Singaporeans have fallen from 52.8 per cent last year in the original Happiness Report to the current figure of 44.5 per cent.
Furthermore, the number of unhappy Singaporeans has now reached a quarter of the populace at 25.3 per cent.
The qualitative research study was conducted on Twitter conversations of 1,000 randomly selected twitterers from December 2011 to March 2012 across gender, race and three broad age segments: 17-25, 26-35 and 36-60.
The study has also revealed many insights into Singaporean life.
Apparently, the majority of Singaporeans go on social media to create a sense of community.
Much of our online tweets revolved around expressions of friendship and connectedness.
Singaporeans were found to be happiest when conversing with friends (95 per cent) and expressing personal opinions (65 per cent) .
On the other end of the spectrum, the top three issues that provoked unhappy tweets from Singaporeans were regarding health, work and products.
90 per cent of tweets regarding health were unhappy, centering on illness, stress, or physical pain.
In addition, men were found to be tweeting more positively about work at 20 per cent, in contrast to women at 12 per cent.
Men also had happier tweets than women.
Another surprising revelation was that men tweeted the happiest during mid-week, reaching a peak on Wednesdays and taking a dip on Fridays.
Comparatively, women were happiest on Thursdays and fell to a low on Sundays.
It was observed that men and women expressed their thoughts differently - women often posted messages of encouragement while men tended to post influential quotes.
