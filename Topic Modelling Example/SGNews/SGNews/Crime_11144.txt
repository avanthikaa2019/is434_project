Yap Siew Ting has pleaded guilty to extorting $150,000 from a 22-year-old man by threatening to upload a nude video of him over the internet.
The 17-year-old had gotten the video through an internet chat scam which she had carried out last year, reported The Straits Times.
Her alleged boyfriend, Alexander Soh Zhi Ren, 22, was her accomplice.
The 22-year-old victim had already paid $97,350 via 89 fund transfers to different POSB accounts before reporting the scam to the police on February 26.
On Tuesday, Yap, who is neither studying nor working, also pleaded guilty to the attempted extortion of $10,000 from another man, aged 24. She will be sentenced later his month.
Soh had came up with the idea of cheating people over the internet after reading an article in the newspaper, the Deputy Public Prosecutor Darryl Soh told a Community Court on Tuesday.
His girlfriend, Yap would log into Alamak.com, an internet chatroom, looking for men to chat with her.
She would then move the conversation to a private webcam chat and engage in conversations with sexual overtones.
During the chats, she got the men to remove their clothes, and Soh, who had hooked up a separate monitor by then, used his iPhone to record the men undressing.
The couple would then confront the victims with the video clips, threaten to upload the videos on the internet and demand money in exchange for not uploading.
Aloysius Tan, Yap's lawyer, who represented her under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, said she deserved a second chance as the entire episode has been a valuable lesson to her.
He added that she had came from a broken home where her drunk father would often beat her and slap her mother.
Community Court Judge Ng Peng Hong will sentence her on June 25.
