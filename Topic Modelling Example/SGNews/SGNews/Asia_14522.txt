TOKYO - Voter support for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has dropped to the lowest level since he took office in 2011, a newspaper survey showed on Monday, with the majority of Japanese opposing his plan to restart nuclear reactors.
The Nikkei survey also found that 50 per cent of Japanese oppose Noda's plan to raise the sales tax to 10 per cent by October 2015 to fund welfare costs and fix public finances.
Support for the government fell to 29 per cent in the survey from 34 per cent a month ago, the lowest since Noda took office in September last year.
Noda is Japan's sixth premier in five years, The government earlier this month declared two reactors at Kansai Electric Power Co's Ohi nuclear plant safe and said they needed to be restarted to avoid a summer power crunch.
But the Nikkei survey found 54 per cent of people oppose the nuclear restart decision and only 30 per cent support it.
Japan will in coming weeks have no nuclear power for the first time in more than 40 years after last year's Fukushima nuclear crisis, triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami, has hammered public faith in nuclear power.
