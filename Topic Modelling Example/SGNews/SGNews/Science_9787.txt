South Korean brand LG has launched Quick Voice for its Android phones launched in the country, in a move to compete with Apple's Siri and Samsung's S Voice.
The voice-recognition technology is used in functions such as searching, setting up of appointments or pulling videos on YouTube, said tech-news site Engadget.
