SINGAPORE - St Andrew's school will be marking its 150th anniversary come April 7.
It will be holding a carnival as part of the celebrations of the three schools at St Andrew's Village in Potong Pasir, where the three schools - St Andrew's Junior School, its secondary school and junior college reside.
As part of its celebrations, the school's parent-teacher association has donated $10,000 worth of tickets to the Club Rainbow (Singapore) charity.
Club Rainbow helps children and youths suffering from a range of chronic and potentially life-threatening illnesses. The charity currently supports more than 500 children, youths and their families by providing free services like befriender networks, counseling and tuition.
&ldquo;At St Andrew's, we truly believe that it takes a village to raise a child, we hope that the children of Club Rainbow will experience our One Family Unbroken spirit at the carnival. Looking at the happy children and family members really makes all of this worth the effort." said Mr Jemmy Ong, Chairman of St Andrew's Parent-Teacher Association at the presentation ceremony held last Saturday.
Tickets to the carnival can be purchased from the General Office of St Andrew's Junior School.
