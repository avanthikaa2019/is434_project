HDB has explained that Wednesday's disruption of its website was due to overwhelming traffic.
Despite preparing for higher traffic during its sales launches, the March 28 surge to 6.3 million page views was much higher than anticipated, said a spokesman in a reply to The New Paper queries.
During the disruption, some online applicants experienced time-outs.
As long as applications are submitted successfully from now to April 3, "applicants who might have faced some initial technical difficulties need not worry about their balloting chances", said the spokesman.
