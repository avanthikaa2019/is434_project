SINGAPORE - The Police have announced that election meetings or rallies can be held from May 17 to 24 at two locations in the Hougang electoral division.
These sites are the Hougang stadium and the open field in front of Blk 837 which is bounded by Hougang Ave 4 and Hougang Central.
Parties who wish to use these locations are required to submit their applications one day before the intended day of the meeting.
The list of permitted rallies to be held tomorrow will be released later this afternoon. The information will also be available on the website www.spf.gov.sg.
The Police say they seek the cooperation of those attending the rallies to leave the sites in an orderly and peaceful manner at the end of each meeting. Officers will be deployed to monitor the situation during the meetings, and the Police will take action against any party or person who engages in behaviour that may disrupt public order.
Election meeting organisers are reminded to strictly comply with the conditions and restrictions stated under the Public Order (Election Meetings) Regulations 2009 before, during and after the rallies.
Rally participants are strongly encouraged to take the public transport as traffic congestion is expected at the roads leading to the rally sites. Motorists travelling within the vicinity of the sites should also anticipate heavy traffic and traffic delays. They are also advised to tune in to the radio for updates on the latest traffic situation.
