SYDNEY - Australia Friday dropped its travel warning for Indonesia to its lowest level since before the 2002 Bali bombings, which ripped apart a bustling nightclub district, killing 202 people.
Australia still advises travellers to "exercise a high degree of caution" when in Indonesia but has eased its overall level from the second-highest warning, which urged people to "reconsider your need to travel".
It puts Indonesia at the same level of threat as Thailand, the Philippines and India.
"We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in Indonesia, including Bali, at this time due to the high threat of terrorist attack," the latest update states.
"We continue to receive information that indicates that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia, which could take place at any time.
"You should exercise particular caution around locations that have a low level of protective security and avoid places known to be possible terrorist targets."
Indonesia had been at "reconsider your need to travel" on Australia's four-tier advisory system since October 2005 when another deadly suicide bombing targetting foreigners took place in Bali.
Prior to that, it had been given an "elevated warning" under a five-tier system which had been in place since the 2002 bombings which killed 88 Australians, a Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said.
The latest advisory update returns the warning level to what it was before those bombings, he added.
The foreign office still cautions against visiting Central Sulawesi, Maluku, Papua and West Papua provinces, keeping these areas under the "reconsider your need to travel" listing.
The advisory noted that since early 2010 Indonesian police had disrupted a number of terrorist groups, including in Jakarta and Bali.
The terror organisation Jemaah Islamiyah which orchestrated the Bali bombing in 2002 is now essentially thought to be defunct.
