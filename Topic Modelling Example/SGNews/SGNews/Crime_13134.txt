A digital camera distributor in the Klang Valley is offering a RM10,000 reward for information on a camera theft syndicate.
The distributor recently suffered RM400,000 (S$163,760) in losses after being scammed by the syndicate, Sinar Harian reported.
Managing director Tan Bee Hock said the company had suffered the losses in two incidents since early this year.
Syndicate members pretend to be the distributor's store or branch managers and ask staff to hand over equipment that was supposedly ordered.
Before that, members of the syndicate would visit the distributor's premises as customers and find out more about products sold in the store.
They would also ask for the names of the supervisors or managers.
Tan said that in the latest incident, an employee who had only worked for the company for four months received a phone call from someone who pretended to be a Klang branch manager on April 27.
"He was ordered to prepare 10 Canon EOS 5D Mark II and 600D cameras as soon as possible," said Tan.
He added that the staff member handed over the 10 cameras, estimated to cost RM51,694, to an unidentified person outside the distributor's premises.
A police report has since been lodged.
Tan sought assistance from the MCA Public Complaints and Services Department.
Department head Datuk Seri Michael Chong said the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur Photography Association had been asked to help track down the stolen cameras.
Chong reminded camera retailers and distributors to be cautious, in light of the recent incidents.
