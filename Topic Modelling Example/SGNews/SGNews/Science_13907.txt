Tablet frenzy has hit Southeast Asia's developing countries with technology lovers there having snapped up more than 1.6 million tablets over the twelve month span of 2011.
According to GfK retail tracking of tablet sales in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, five out of these six countries registered consistent expansion over each previous quarters.
The fourth most populous country in the world, Indonesia, reported a substantial 97 per cent spike in tablet sales in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter to reach over 245,000 units.
Meanwhile, Malaysia remains the biggest market for tablets in the region. It began and ended ended the year with the highest sales with total revenue reaching US$374 million.
Android is the region's favourite operating system (OS). Almost two in every three tablets purchased runs on Android. Its strong performance continues into the new year, chalking up almost US$243 million in sales within the first two months of the year, further growing its share of the volume pie to 70 per cent.
"Due to the open source nature of the Android OS, tablets running on this system are generally priced lower than those running on other OS and its greater affordability encourages mass consumer adoption which in turn accelerates further development of its ecosystem." explained Mr. Gerard Tan, Account Director for Digital Technology at GfK Asia
While price of Android tablets averaged at around US$531 in 2011, those using other operating systems hovered at US$676 - the 30 per cent price difference being a turn-off for potential consumers.
