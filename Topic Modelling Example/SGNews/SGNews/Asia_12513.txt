A company apologized for publishing a poorly modified picture of people visiting a landscape project in Yuhang, East China's Zhejiang province.
In the picture published on the Yuhang government website (www.yuhang.gov.cn/), five people seem to be floating in the air while looking at a green belt on May 8.
"We made a serious mistake in operation. We are deeply sorry," the company responsible for the landscape project said in a statement. It admitted the picture was modified on Photoshop because the original two were not "good."
A similar Photoshop gaff went viral on the Internet in 2011 when a picture of three officials in Huili County, Southwest China's Sichuan province, was so clearly edited on Photoshop, with their feet floating above an ungraded road.
