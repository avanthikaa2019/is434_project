PETALING JAYA - Popular comedian Saiful Apek, who was charged with drug abuse two years ago, was freed without his defence being called by the magistrate's court yesterday.
In an immediate reaction, the celebrity, whose real name is Mohd Saifulazam Mohamed Yusoff, said he had faith in the judiciary and thanked his fans for their support.
Saiful, 43, was charged in November last year, with three of his friends, for committing the offence at the Subang Jaya district police headquarters narcotics division a year earlier.
His friends, Shah Zainatull Ehsan Al-Muazam Shah Yahya, 29, Shaiful Baharom, 25, and Noremy Mohamad, 29 were also freed yesterday.
In his ruling, magistrate Ahmad Solihin Abd Wahid found there were contradictions in material evidence.
One of the issues was the contradiction on the discrepancies on the dates in the labelling on the urine sample containing the urine samples of Saiful Apek and Noremy.
The sample was also kept for a long time before it was sent to the Chemistry Department.
A total of eight witnesses testified for the prosecution.
Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Ishrakh Saad said he would appeal against the decision.
Lawyers Mohd Fadhly Hashim and Zamri Idrus appeared for the four accused.
Saiful Apek, Shah Zainatull Ehsan, Shaiful and Noremy were charged under Section 15(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, which carries a maximum imprisonment for two years or RM5,000 (S$2,000) fine upon conviction.
