INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana - LeBron James finished with 40 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists and Dwyane Wade had 30 points as the Miami Heat beat the Indiana Pacers 101-93 Sunday to level their NBA playoff series.
Wade also nine rebounds and six assists for the Heat, who rebounded from a disappointing loss in game three in which Wade didn't hit his first shot until the third quarter.
But Wade and James were back on the mark in game four and they now head back home level at 2-2 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference second-round series on Tuesday.
Miami is also still smarting from the loss of forward Chris Bosh, who went down in game one with a lower abdominal strain and isn't expected to return in the series.
Danny Granger scored 20 points to lead the Pacers.
