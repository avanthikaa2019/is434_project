SINGAPORE - The new logo and mascot for this year's Singapore National Games (SNG) was unveiled today at the commencement of Community Games 2012 at Senja-Cashew Community Club, reported a local news channel.
The logo, designed by Yong Wen Yeu from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, depicts the alphabets S, N and G in a colourful flowing graphic representing the spirit and energy of sports.
The mascot on the other hand is a cute lion with a fiery mane and heart shaped face named 'Nila', inspired by founder of Singapore Sang Nila Utama.
It was designed by Singapore Polytechnic student Beatrice Cho.
The lion was chosen as the animal represents courage, power, royalty and wisdom.
The fiery mane symbolises the burning passion of the athletes and the heart-shaped face represents the love of people coming together as a community, she said.
Both logo and mascot were unveiled by Minister of State for the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Mr Teo Ser Luck - who is the Adviser for the SNG Steering Committee.
They were chosen by the public in a three-week long voting process on the 35 logo and 16 mascot designs submitted by various design schools.
The Singapore National Games is a community-based multi-sports competition which will take place from September 1 to September 9, 2012.
The event is jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council, People's Association and its grassroots organisations, as well as 10 National Sports Associations.
The qualifying round of the Community Games will see 43 matches being played, and will include sports such as badminton, basketball and football.
