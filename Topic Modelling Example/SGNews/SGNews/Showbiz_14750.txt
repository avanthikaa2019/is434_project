Budding actress Fatin Afifah has denied being a lesbian, reported Kosmo!.
The 18-year-old actress said claims that she was lesbian and had a tattoo on her hips were mere lies spread to embarrass her.
"Perhaps there are people who are jealous of me. But I do not want to accuse anyone of creating the trouble,'' said Fatin who had acted in the movies Tentang Bulan and Brainscan.
Fatin added that she has a boyfriend, and that the "tomboy" associated with her was a good friend.
Fatin also clarified that the photograph circulating on the Internet showing her and a "tomboy" was actually a part of a cropped group photograph.
