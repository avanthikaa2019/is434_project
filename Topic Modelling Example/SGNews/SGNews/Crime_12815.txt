A 38-year-old woman was gang-raped by three men who pulled her into a car when she was walking alone in Brickfields at about 7am on Sunday, China Press reported.
One of the men held a knife to her neck and raped her in the car, it reported.
They then drove her to an empty house and the trio raped her again.
The rapists also took the victim's mobile phone and RM100 (S$40) cash before dropping her in Jalan Tun Sambanthan.
A passer-by helped the victim call the police. Police confirmed the case.
It was learnt that the rapists recorded the incident.
Police believe the gang targets women who walk alone.
Sources said the gang would look out for victims in the early morning in housing estates.
