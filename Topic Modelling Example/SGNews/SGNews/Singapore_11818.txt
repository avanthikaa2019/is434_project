She's only eight, but budding tennis player Clare Cheng may soon get to realise her dream of meeting her favourite athletes in the sport - including Chinese professional player Li Na - during the London Olympic Games.
"(Li Na is) the first Asian lady to win the Grand Slam and she makes me feel proud when people talk about her," she said.
Clare currently holds the No. 1 ranking for the Singapore Tennis Association junior singles' category for girls under 10.
The Singapore Chinese Girls' School pupil was chosen to be one of three kids representing Singapore as young journalists at the Olympic Games - from July 27 to Aug 12 - under the McDonald's Champions Of Play programme.
McDonald's yesterday announced the winners at an event attended by Madam Halimah Yacob, Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports.
The contest was kicked off in March, with nearly 200 applications received from children aged six to 12. The winners were decided based on public voting and the decisions of a panel of judges.
The other two winners - also girls - are Lau Ywen, 12, and Sneha Sivakumar, 11. Ywen is the current champion in fencing competitions in Singapore and Malaysia, while Sneha has represented Singapore in international squash tournaments.
Judging-panel member Terrence Voon, a sports correspondent for The Straits Times, said: "(The winners) were very genuine, very outgoing, and I think they will do Singapore proud at the Olympics."
