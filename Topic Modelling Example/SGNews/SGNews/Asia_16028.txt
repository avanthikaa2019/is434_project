PHNOM PENH - The world should accept the fact that the Asean way of undertaking constructive engagement and moral persuasion is successful.
Referring to Myanmar's success in holding 45 by-elections recently, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said this showed that the government's efforts towards national reconciliation and democratisation had been going smoothly.
Najib said the internal matters of Myanmar had been a constraint towards the regional grouping's aim to achieve the Asean Community in 2015.
"But now, Myanmar has taken steps to be accepted as a part of the global community," he said after attending the 20th Asean Summit.
Najib said aside from including this in the communique, Asean leaders had agreed that they would convey this message to the leaders of countries that had imposed sanctions on Myanmar.
Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party had won a landslide victory in the vote. Myanmar President Thein Sein said the by-elections were carried out successfully.
Najib said the leaders had also adopted four documents, including the Global Movement of Moderates (GMM) concept paper and Declaration on Drug-Free Asean 2015, adding that a road map to promote the movement should be drawn up to synchronise the activities at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the necessary momentum was sustained.
"I'm pleased that the concept mooted by Malaysia was supported by the leaders," he said.
