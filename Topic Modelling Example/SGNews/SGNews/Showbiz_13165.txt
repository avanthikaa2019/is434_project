India's most prolific and probably one of the busiest playback singers Sonu Nigam (left) will be making his way back to Singapore.
The 38-year-old singer will be performing his hits at the renovated Suntec Convention Hall with its new sound and audio-visual systems on May 18. His last concert in Singapore was in 2010.
Sonu will be accompanied by a 30-member troupe comprising musicians, dancers and back-up singers from India and his 21/2-hour concert will have a sound and light display on the 60 feet long LED wall.
