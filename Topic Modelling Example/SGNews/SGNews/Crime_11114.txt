HULU SELANGOR: A metal company supervisor was robbed of RM70,000 (S$28,144) by two parang wielding men in Bukit Sentosa yesterday, just minutes after he withdrew the cash from a bank nearby.
The 1.55pm incident happened when the 53-year old man and his colleague stopped to check a punctured tyre about 1km from the bank in Bukit Beruntung.
Hulu Selangor police chief Superintendent Norel Azmi Yahya Afendi said the victims believed that they were tailed by their robbers soon after they exited the bank.
"The victim was driving when he realised that the car's front left tyre was flat.
"They were checking the tyre and damages to its wheel when the robbers, who came in a Toyota Camry, rushed towards them and pointed parang to their faces," he said.
Scared of being harmed, the victims just watched helplessly when the robbers took away the cash they withdrew for the company's use.
"Initial investigations found that there was a sharp object stuck in the tyre."
The case is being investigated under Section 395 and 397 of the Penal Code for armed robbery.
Meanwhile, in another case, Norel said a car trader was beaten up by three men who were unhappy with his plan to open a car towing business in Jalan Besar Hulu Bernam on Monday.
He said the 37-year-old victim was called by one of the suspects to a car workshop there to discuss about the cost to repair a lorry.
However, when he arrived there, the victim was beaten up by the suspects, who also used spanner, beer cans and plastic chairs as weapons.
