Police in Vartak Nagar, near Thane in northern India, have arrested a 25-year-old man who allegedly sold his teenage sister to a man who wanted a young bride.
The girl's brother reportedly sold her to the 32-year-old man for Rs60,000 (S$1,440).
Malaysia Nanban reported that the police arrested Deepak Gadekar and five others who were implicated in the deal.
The 14-year-old girl was married to Dinesh Malwas in a ceremony that was said to be illegally solemnised at a temple in Gujerat on March 17.
Dinesh has been charged with rape for allegedly having sex with a minor.
Senior Inspector Shahaji Jadhav said the matter came to light last week when the girl returned to her parents' home and told them what happened.
The family then lodged a police report against Deepak and seven others, including Dinesh and his parents.
