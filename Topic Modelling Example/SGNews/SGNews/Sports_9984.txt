FUKUSHIMA - Japanese soccer star Shinji Kagawa held a coaching clinic for primary school students in Soma, Fukushima Prefecture, on Tuesday, as part of activities to support children in areas hit by the Great East Japan Earthquake.
Kagawa, who will transfer from Germany's Borussia Dortmund to English Premier League giant Manchester United this summer, was invited as a guest coach for a soccer class organized by former national team goalkeeper Nobuyuki Kojima at the municipal Nittaki Primary School.
The class was held inside the school's gym due to rainy weather.
"I can only stay for a short while, but I hope we can have fun today," Kagawa said to 48 students in the first to third years. They responded with a hearty cheer. The students were amazed by Kagawa's skills as the attacking midfielder easily dribbled past 10 students.
The event, which was part of the Smile Field campaign to encourage children in areas hit by the disaster through soccer, was supported by Kirin Holdings Co. and the Japan Football Association.
