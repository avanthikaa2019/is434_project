BEIJING - Forty people were killed when a brief but violent hailstorm and torrential rain swept through a mountainous region of northwest China, the local government said on Sunday.
Eighteen others remained missing in Min county, a disaster-prone area of Gansu province, while 87 had been sent to hospital, the county government said in a statement on its website.
Officials said 29,300 people had been evacuated after rain and hail battered the county for just 60 minutes late Thursday afternoon.
It had &ldquo;wreaked havoc&rdquo; on all of the county's 18 townships and had affected more than two-thirds of its 450,000 residents, the state-controlled Xinhua news agency reported.
&ldquo;Roads were blocked, houses collapsed, farmland was destroyed, and the power supply and telecommunications services were disrupted by the extreme weather,&rdquo; the agency said, quoting Xu Guangyao, a senior county official.
Min county is 150 kilometres (94 miles) from Zhouqu county, where a rain-triggered mudslide killed about 1,500 people in August 2010.
