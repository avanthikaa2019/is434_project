BEIJING - The US ambassador to China on Thursday strongly denied accounts that Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng was pressured to leave the US embassy in Beijing.
"I can tell you unequivocally that he was never pressured to leave. He was excited and eager about leaving," Ambassador Gary Locke told reporters a day after Chen left the US embassy under a controversial deal.
Chen has said he fears for his safety after leaving the embassy on Wednesday.
Some activists say the 40-year-old activist left the embassy under pressure, including threats by China to retaliate against his wife.
Locke said that US officials listened to part of a telephone conversation between Chen and his wife, shortly before his decision to leave the embassy.
"She was imploring him to come to the hospital to be reunited with the family and saying that there will always be uncertainties and we need to take first steps," Locke said.
Locke said that Chen told him during their hours of conversation that he was prepared to spend "years" in the US embassy unless he had a deal that met his satisfaction.
"He knew the stark choices in front of him. He knew that and was very aware that he might have to spend many, many years in the embassy, but he was prepared to do that unless the terms of an agreement with the Chinese government" satisfied him, Locke said.
But Locke said that Chen had voiced concern about the fate of his family in eastern Shandong province if he stayed in the embassy.
Locke said that Chen was satisfied with Wednesday's agreement after rejecting an earlier proposal.
He did not describe the earlier plan in detail, but said that Chen had demanded a personal meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao, to whom he earlier sent a defiant open video-message.
The ambassador said that Chen accepted the proposal that the Chinese government "take a first step as a sign of good faith", and received that first step when authorities allowed his family to come to Beijing.
