At this point in his career, Jason Statham seems content to be perfectly mediocre, starring in one forgettable action thriller after another.
For his latest project, directed by Boaz Yakin (Death In Love, 2008), he is thrown into the mix together with a grab bag of crime- movie elements.
Chinese triads, corrupt cops and Russian gangsters, along with a savant child, are blended for a fast-paced but rather-bland film.
Safe (NC16) Action/ 94 minutes Rating: 2/5 stars
