KLANG, Malaysia - A man had his finger severed when he tried to fend off three armed men robbing his family in Taman Sentosa here.
In the 5.20am incident yesterday, the victim was about to drive off from his house when the robbers, armed with parang, rushed in.
One of the men held the victim down in his car while the other two tried to break into the house, said South Klang OCPD Asst Comm Mohamad Mat Yusop.
"The victim tried to open the car door but he was attacked by one of the robbers. This resulted in him having his middle finger cut off," he said, adding that the robbers fled empty-handed in a black car.
Initial investigations showed the car had a fake number plate.
ACP Mohamad said the victim was in stable condition at Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital.
