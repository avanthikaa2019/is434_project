A woman was arrested Tuesday for killing her husband who had sexually assaulted their disabled daughter.
Their two other children were booked for assisting in the murder.
Police in Seongnam said the 48-year-old woman and her son and daughter suffocated the man last Wednesday after biding his hands and feet with ropes and put tape on his mouth.
They acted after the 48-year-old drunk father sexually assaulted their 26-year-old daughter, who suffers from brain lesions.
