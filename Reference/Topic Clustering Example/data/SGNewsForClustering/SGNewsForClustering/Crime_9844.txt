SINGAPORE - A second man has been sentenced to three months' jail for tricking an elderly woman into handing over $10,000 in a gold coin scam.
According to The Straits Times, Malaysian Yap Bun Kwong, 66, admitted to deceiving Madam Lam Lai Yin, 70, into believing that she was investing the money to buy gold coins in Feb this year.
One of his co-accused, Mohamed Sarip Ejang, 72, was jailed three months for cheating Madam Lam at Bugis Junction, Victoria Street, on Feb 21.
Two other men - Sum Hone Yang, 80, and Poh Choon Hoe, 53 - are on the run.
On Feb 15, Yap and Sum approached the victim at Toa Payoh and talked about helping her to find a job.
They met again six days later on the pretext of arranging a job for her.
A third man, Mohamed Sarip, joined and claimed that his brother was involved in an accident and asked him to sell some gold coins.
He showed Madam Lam a small gold coin and claimed he had 3,000 of them for sale at $380 each, but needed $80,000 to retrieve them from the warehouse where they were stored.
Madam Lam agreed to invest $10,000, and handed over $2,000 on the spot to Yap. She subsequently withdrew another $8,000 and passed it to Sum at Bugis Junction.
