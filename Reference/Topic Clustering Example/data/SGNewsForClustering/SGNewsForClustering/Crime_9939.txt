SERDANG, MALAYSIA: A 44-year-old mechanic, believed to be mentally unstable, was arrested Wednesday for the brutal murder of his elderly uncle and aunt at their house in Seri Kembangan, near here.
The incident occured around 4.30am, when the man beat his 70-year-old uncle, Lee Yoke Ming, to death with a steel pipe before crushing his 68-year-old aunt, Lee Kim Lin, with a large television set.
The man was found covered in blood by his parents shortly after the incident.
"We had left the house around 4.30am to go open our fruit stall in the nearby market when a neighbour called me saying they heard cries for help coming from our house," said the man's father.
"We rushed home and found my brother and his wife dead, and my son covered in blood," he added.
It is believed the uncle constantly teased his nephew for being slow, which may have provoked the attack.
"He was trying to wash the blood from his hands when I found him, and he looked at me and asked me what he should do," he said, adding that he advised him to go to the police.
The man surrendered to police who arrived at the scene.
Serdang OCPD Supt Abdul Razak Elias confirmed the incident.
