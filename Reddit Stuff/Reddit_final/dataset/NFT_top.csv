NFT,,"not a bad idea, but the sad truth is that this idea is at least as likely to be used for predatory purposes...meaning, for example, 

1) a very much consensual and solicited pic is sent 

2) relationship changes for some reason 

3) one party in the relationship decides to attack the other party and do what they can to hurt them

 4) pics previously held in confidence are used as weapons against the one who sent them

this type of tactic is a go to for toxic women especially, b\\c social and reputational violence is an area where women are likely to be fundamentally better skilled than men

put another way: men are more likely to be adept at physical matters (generally speaking), so a toxic man is generally more likely to resort to physical violence, and/or threats of it

men are more likely to be adept at emotional and reputational matters (generally speaking), so a toxic woman is generally more likely to resort to emotional and reputational violence, and/or threats of it

Put yet another way: vulnerability will be used as a weapon against the vulnerable by some people, sometimes, regardless of their gender.  

And just tohopefully head off some of the inevitable attacks I am going to get for saying this,  I will spell it out:

No gender is simply ""better"" or ""worse"" than another. There are, however, tendencies towards greater levels of skill in different genders....\*tendencies\*. Whether these skills are used as tools for the good or as weapons of evil is entirely up to the people with those skills.",grxgvqu,2021-03-23 14:00:59,XLG-TheSight,[],/r/NFT/comments/mbc9m7/interesting_use_case_for_nfts_lol/grxgvqu/,12,0,,12,0,mbc9m7,comment

NFT,What are NFTs? How to mint an NFT? Why are NFTs valuable? - Starting guide to NFTs,"**Hello everyone, welcome to the world of NFTs.**

You may be new to blockchain and crypto, or you may have been in crypto for years at this point - but you in both cases - you probably are just now learning about NFTs. 

This will be a guide that is ever living/changing to help introduce NFTs, what gives them value and how you can get started in the NFT space. 




##What exactly is a Non-Fungible Token or NFT?

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique, individual token existing on a blockchain such as Ethereum. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, each NFT token contains unique data meaning non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable with each other. This non-fungible nature of the tokens means their use cases differ greatly from their fungible counterparts.

A normal token can be exchanged for the same type of token equally without any difference. 

>A good example is a dollar  - 
 >if you and I both have a dollar — we can swap dollars and it doesn’t matter, neither of us lose out they are equal. Whereas, with non-fungible tokens they are both >unique, meaning if we both have an NFT, mine could be a baseball card, and yours could be your Birth Certificate — obviously we cannot exchange these two >equally. Therefore making our tokens non-fungible.

Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable digital scarcity. NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items. This has initially proven popular for blockchain games and collectibles like CryptoKitties on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs can also be used to represent in-game assets, which are in control of the user instead of the game developer. One exciting benefit of this arrangement means the non-fungible tokens or digital items, may actually outlive the game they were initially created for and find incorporate into separate future games. Yet another potential use is in digital art, by helping prove authenticity and ownership.

Artwork is another example of how powerful NFTs can be. By allowing artists to create artwork on the blockchain as NFTs, it means their content now becomes sellable globally, on decentralized marketplaces. **Providing a means to collect, earn, and make a living off crypto.**

**NFTs are one of the best ways to actually earn crypto over time, without needing to invest in it directly.** *(unlike scams that say the same thing, NFTs are legit. Its like opening a store on ebay or etsy, your trading your time and work for money).*

##What gives an NFT its value?

There are a ton of reasons to buy NFTs. 

1. **Unique** - Each NFT is unique, its the only one of its kind. You cannot make another NFT that is the same token number on the same smart contract. Meaning there will only ever be one of that token. This is verified by the blockchain and can be seen by anyone. 

2. **Copyright** - Your NFT might come with copyright if you are using Mintable.app. If the seller chooses to do so - it means that its on the blockchain that the owner of that token would have complete commercial copyright to use that image and asset. 

3. **Rare** - Since they are unique and cannot be copied, they are rare. Most of the time, there are very few NFTs from an artist or seller - very rarely do they have 1000s of NFTs. Therefore, you can safely assume you would be one of the few people in the world that owns an collectible item,  that can be resold. 

4. **Collectible** - These NFTs/items are collectible. You can hold onto them, and their value will only go up in price since there are little ways to dilute the collection. Buying them to resell them can earn you thousands of dollars. There are plenty of people who do it everyday and earn a living from it.

5. **Downloadable** - If on Mintable.app, only the current owner of the NFT can download the file attached to it. Making it unlockable to the owner. If your NFT has something like, game assets, music, a PDF, or more locked inside it, you might want to buy the NFT just to download that song/PDF/etc. 

6. **Immutable** - No one can change the metadata on the token, no one can remove your image, or the name of the token, etc. This means it will never change, it will never be removed, it cannot be taken down off the blockchain. This is what gives it so much value and collectibility 

7. **Forever** - NFTs are forever. Because the data doesn't change, and because the blockchain is forever, you will always have that token if you buy it. You can always resell that token if you want. Its like buying a bar of gold - you own it, and you can do with it what you want. 

8. **Resellable** - You can always resell your NFT. You SHOULD resell your NFT and trade it. You can make some serious cash trading NFTs. Some NFTs have gone for 20,000 USD + when the original buyer only bought it for  a few thousand dollars. Making them over 15,000 USD in a short time in ONE trade! 

**NFTs are valuable**

##How do I get started with Buying/Trading NFTs? 

You need ETH and an ethereum wallet to get started. The most common is Metamask.io - then you add some ETH into that wallet. This is required by all sites in order to interact with an Ethereum application. 

**Step 2: Find a marketplace.**

The top NFT marketplaces are currently: 

[Mintable.app](https://Mintable.app)

[Opensea](https://opensea.io)

[SuperRare](https://superrare.co)

[Rarible](https://rarible.com)

*there are more NFT marketplaces but these are the leading open marketplaces, others may not be open to all NFTs and only select items*

Some of these let you create your own NFTs (if your a creator) and some of them are closed like SuperRare, where only approved artists can create items. 

Below we will discuss creating NFTs. 

##How do I get started minting NFTs?

If you are a content creator, whether its artwork, graphic designs, 3D models, videos, PDF, research - it can all be turned into an NFT using platforms like Mintable.app. Mintable is the most flexible and has the most possibilities so we will be using it and discussing how you can use it. 

*Note: there are plenty of places to make NFTs, but they either are: more expensive, have file size limits below 50mb, don't let you control your contracts, or do not offer decentralization.*

###Minting on Mintable.app

On Mintable you can sign up for an account and then its free to start Minting NFTs. You have three options to select from when you choose to mint:

>1. Your own store
>2. Mint in Mintables store
>3. Gasless minting 

**Your own store:**

When you create your own store, you are making a smart contract on the blockchain - that you own, you control, your the only person who owns it. This is the preferred method for creating NFTs but there is one single downside....

Deploying a smart contract COSTS a ton if gas prices are above 50 gwei. Around $100 initial investment to deploy the smart contract - but after that, you can mint hundreds of NFTs for as little as $10 using Mintable's batch minting. 
 
If you think of it as an 'operational cost' to get an online business going, $100 isn't that bad. But if your struggling to pay that - then you can mint under Mintable's store, where everyone shares the contract and can mint NFTs (that still are owned by you!) but don't need to worry about deploying your own store. 

When you create your store you can choose where the data is stored:

**Most Flexible**: Let Mintable handle it

**Decentralized but no batch minting**: Data is on IPFS

**Complete control**: Your own servers or other locations you can pick 

*Mintable is the only place that lets you pick where the data is stored, and so this is one of the big reasons people use it*



**Mintable's Store**

You save on transaction fees when you use Mintable's store as you don't need to pay the initial overhead of deploying your own store to the blockchain. Everyone can use Mintable's store for free, and can mint thousands of NFTs in a single transaction doing so. This is one of the reasons Mintable.app is the most flexible platform for creating NFTs, no where else can you make so many NFTs for so cheap. 

**Gasless Minting**

You are able to mint directly on Mintable's store without needing to submit a single transaction, meaning no transaction fees from the blockchain. 

This is the best way to get started. You can do it at https://mintable.app/gasless


###Minting the NFT

Once you've decided what store your NFT will be minted on - the next step is actually Minting! 

*There are a ton of possibilities when minting on mintable, so here is a more in depth breakdown of everything that is happening [Creating an item](https://docs.mintable.app/ethereum-version/basics/how-to-create-an-item)*

Once you click sell - you will be taken to a page to create your listing for your NFT and the mint it on the blockchain. **Its very similar to listing an item for sale on ebay, etsy, or amazon.**

You can create your title, the subtitle, add a description (make it good and tell a story behind your NFT!)

**Uploading your content**

Mintable has huge file limits, 3gb for the private unlockable file, and 200mb for the preview images. 

This is great as it means you can upload huge 4k mp4s, high res photos, zip files, or more. 

**Unlockable private file**

This file is a private file that ONLY the current owner of the NFT can access, so if your selling a video NFT, you may upload a low res, short clip as the preview image that anyone can see - but once a buyer purchases your NFT, they can download the full, 4k resolution video. 

**Preview images**

You then can upload the image for the NFT itself, and the preview images for the listing. The first image you upload is the NFT image that shows in wallets, and the other images are shown on the listing page. Think of it like Amazon, the first image is the image people see when browsing amazon, and the other images are the extra images shown when they click on the item page. 

Set your price for the item, select a few other options like transferring copyright or making it non-resellable, and then list it for sale! 


After your transactions are submitted thats it, you just created an item on the blockchain that you own, you control, and you can sell. Congrats!

NFT,,"I have a couple of layman's thoughts I'm still sorting out. One is that the nft is not the art. The nft is just data. The trading card or artwork or song whatever has its use value in a different media that can be separated from the blockchain. 

I can look at the finest nfts demanding the highest prices and just download or screen capture them. I then have exactly what the owner has except for this abstract concept of the contract.  They say that blockchains are permanent. but a lot of the nfts are tied to particular marketplaces. Like I can get a Wax trading card that only exists in the Wax ecosystem or I can get fine art at Nifty Gateway that is only compatible with the Nifty website. 

What happens to the nft if the organization that hosts it goes bankrupt and closes up shop?  You can say that the unique contract still exists somewhere in the net but what does that mean when the host doesn't exist? If WilliamShatner.io shuts down do I really have anything other than a jpeg of a ham actor with no monetary value?
I'm not trying to be a naysayer here I've spent money in the marketplace and I'm enjoying seeing new projects pop up. It just raises a lot of questions about what value is and how the market might be manipulated.

Also this part I totally don't understand. They say that blockchains can be looked at for verification and proves ownership. But if I look at the ethereum or other blockchain and find the contract what will I actually see? Is the nft content embedded there or is it just a chunk of data with my associated key number?",gjh49ob,2021-01-16 16:39:08,Clumsywon,[],/r/NFT/comments/kw8tu3/what_are_nfts_how_to_mint_an_nft_why_are_nfts/gjh49ob/,226,0,,226,0,kw8tu3,comment

NFT,,"im new to NFT but not to crypto, I'd like some help on how to think or perceive the variety of lens on the authenticity of physical goods with NFT, or if that's even a viable use of NFT's

How do you keep a physical collectible authentic with its associated NFT. For example, what if I saw a collectible items 'watermarked' with its NFT, I liked it so much that I went home and literally made a copy of it. It's so similar that unless a person had been sitting down with both versions for a few hours you wouldn't be able to say which one was the first and real one. 

Then i went on an NFT minting site and registered my copy with its own NFT.

Technically now there are two of these collectible items with their own NFT. In that way they are different because they have their own NFT to identify each other, but the physical items aren't unique in its idea and conception.

Or is that out of the realm of NFT and proving authenticity? As in, now there are just two instances of a similar collectible item that are separated by their NFT identity?

I suppose it's just something I haven't really absorbed and realized the intrinsic value of owning a particular NFT versus owning a collectible that happens to have its own NFT. Like I'm not able to associate value with owning a specific NFT, I'm associating the value of the collectible that the NFT is attached with.

Anyways I'm not knocking on NFTs, I am very interested in them and want to learn and understand everything about them! Thanks for any help/advice/suggestions",go2dkqr,2021-02-20 00:14:46,beemoTheAngryRoomba,[],/r/NFT/comments/kw8tu3/what_are_nfts_how_to_mint_an_nft_why_are_nfts/go2dkqr/,23,0,,23,0,kw8tu3,comment
NFT,,"I have some questions!

Data storage: 

* Mintable says they are the only ones where you can choose where to store data. Where do other minting places store their date?
* If you let mintable handle it, where do they store their data?
* How future-proof is IPFS?
* If you make your own choice, what's a good secure place to store data? 
* Is there any possible way to change that link to the data in the future in case it somehow goes down?

Pricing:

* Is there a list of the costs other minting place charge?
* Do you always pay per NFT, or only ever per batch?

Other questions:

* What are the downsides to mintable's gasless minting?
* If you'd like to start a collectible set to add to in the future, is gassless minting a good option or should you really use the normal method?
* Do other stores have an upside mintable doesn't?
* Should I wait for l2? I understood it's coming in an update soon. (really confused on the l2 stuff)
* Are there non-ethereum based NFT art/collectible protocols that might be preferable?
* Any other important info that's not included in this how to mint tutorial?",gpspxz6,2021-03-05 17:56:24,Arghmybrain,[],/r/NFT/comments/kw8tu3/what_are_nfts_how_to_mint_an_nft_why_are_nfts/gpspxz6/,20,0,,20,0,kw8tu3,comment

NFT,,"This is a great way of showcasing Crypto Art! The technique of the artists is great. However...

In some ways, I guess the art is unintendedly brilliant from art's viewpoint as being a ""true"" perception of our times and in consciousness. But is it a real accurate perception of our times and consciousness without any criticism? Without any pushback?

 Can we make art that functions as more than art dope? Is this what Crypto art is about and must always be about? 

We need more dialog about the multifunctionality of Crypto art- how art in general functions in society. And can function. Crypto art ( art NFTs) can go to serious and new places of pondering the human condition. Will it? Will it be allowed? Do we even want this? Will the platforms support it? Can we go to the next level? What is that next level? 

I applaud the talent and technique and the right to express whatever kind of art a person wishes freely. But I still think we are passing up an opportunity here and need people that have a vision to band together and push the art forward. I would love to start a subreddit around these themes, but I don't have time on Reddit and karma. Could I partner with someone?

NFT,,"It's not bad, but just a pleasant picture.  That is really great light to work with.  Try and find a scene where your glow is more centered.  To get a warmer feel (you'll want tripod) lower shutter speed, like 1/60, and f-stop to compensate.  I think you just missed the real nice rays here, had the sun been higher and the clouds a bit thinner...  The route to good photography, like in most arts, is the grind.  When I was doing my thing I'd be out 20 days of any month, before sunrise to be where I wanted to be.  Break by 10:00 because mid-day light is shit, sleep and rest up for late aft, sunset, rinse and repeat.  And take LOTS AND LOTS of pictures of everything.  Bird flying by...  good opportunity to practice one more time, tracking and snapping.  Doesn't matter if that shot is shit, you're practicing muscle memory movement and reflex.  It took years of that grind, and you'll know you're making progress when you look at your older snaps, wince and think, ew, that was shit.  :D  This is a good thing!

NFT,,"Make this a meme:

I saw the future and I am even more famous than DFV. The value of art is in the eye of the beholder. It has no intrinsic value - just the value attributed to it by society based on perceived beauty, historical significance, and the stories we tell.

The below NFT is on sale for one more day. I like the stonk. If we all tell the story that this piece of art is significant, then it will become significant. If media picks it up, it will become history. Once people tell stories, it really is valuable.

NFT,,"First off, great work.

I'm still trying to understand NFTs. When I look at this vs. the Crypto punks, it is LIGHT YEARS ahead of them. Will that translate into more ETH for you? I think it should. What other factors determine this?

If someone wanted to get into designing NFTs what kind of software do you use?

Semi-legal status ➝ No legal framework  
Anonymity ➝ Anonymous creators and collectors  
Hand sales ➝ Shilling  
Euphoria ➝ High bids or feeling of ownership

✦ 0.9% — gas fee admixture  
✦ blue tint — hints at its digital and mythical nature

NFT,,"It plays on most culture that having wife drilled is a bad bad thing. People who don't know will think this is true. People who hate NFT will propagate it as true. But it's not accurate.

1. You can't/should not sell your wife.   
You can and probably should sell your NFTs at some point.
2. Chances of extra cost on wife getting drilled, ie. STD and pregnancy  
No such risk on NFT
3. In case of marriage certificate. You might think it worth nothing, until you realize the wife has a net worth of 1 billion  
As far as I know, no NFT is worth 1B yet, but you see how the explanation above does not hint the financial/legal benefits
4. As far as I know, all NFTs are younger than legal age. Anyone drilling NFT is probably gonna go to jail  
Except you can't go to jail for drilling NFT

Better explanation but less catchy:  
You have a limited game in your Steam library. People pirate the game but you don't. You don't play it that much and you can sell that game 2nd hand.

I really think all digital goods should be NFT so we can sell it when we don't need it anymore. Imagine the world you can buy Adobe Cloud just for these few projects and re-sell it when you're done.

Aavegotchi did a thing with Cometh to make NFT spaceships for mining comets for money. And i still find more and more. Other than that, i really think its Whales flexing their crypto muscles.

NFT,,"These are tight.

Some things you may not be aware of- Opensea has a 1 eth minimum on auctions since they cover the transfer gas cost. They’d lose money otherwise with their 2.5% royalty.

So with the bid listing format you’ve put up it won’t resolve automatically (unless the bids go over 1 ETH), it will end the auction without a winner. 

However it will keep the offers people have submitted… you’ll wind up able to accept the offers manually but since you’ll be triggering the transaction it’ll have you cover the gas cost. That’ll eat through the 0.02 of value you listed at and mentioned in other comments. 

Also with bids you’ll be paid in wrapped ether rather than ETH (still the same value, but it’s another pricy transaction on uniswap or sushi swap to “un-wrap” it back to normal ETH). 

For future reference- If you list for a fixed price the buyer will trigger the transaction and have to cover gas, and you’ll be paid in ETH instead of WETH. 

Last comment- opensea bids are fickle because people can withdraw them any time before the end of the auction for pretty low transaction cost. As the seller I’m pretty sure you are able to accept a bid before the auction ends. Looks like you’ve got a couple bids up there to get you going.

NFT,,"I literally started 2 NFT projects, one generative art project a normal art project.

And guess what, 0 sales! No sales from like 105 NFTs

Perhaps because i have no abnormal benefits like a frickin yacht club. Makes sense! Bored ape yacht club deserve their sales.

Or an overhyped community thinking that NFT flipping is an accessible billion dollar industry. Which makes sense but should not be happening.

I am open to the fact that this is about money, and i agree some NFT projects are absurd for their prices and use community and brand as an excuse. They try making it seem like something else.

I have seen ugly NFTs charge like over 1 ETH on projects that have like 10.000 1/1 NFTs.

I would not dare putting 0.1 on any type of generative art with that much copies. 
What is the value knowing 9,999 people have the same thing as you but a different hat.

 instead of losing money on stocks all the goddamn time. that's why I like about Bitcoin if it goes down it goes down but when it goes back up it goes back up.
Unlike stocks you going to lose your f****** shirt. Friend of mine put $50 in Bitcoin three years ago it went all the way up when the

 market fluctuated to 60 or 70 now mine you that's only $50 he did as a test okay right now it done drop down to $43 on his wallet imagine what would have happened if he invested a little bit more?

NFT,,"Just curious how people see these magical nft video game items actually working.

Every game is coded differently.
An nft cant be changed to just ""fit"" in a new game.


Nft's are presented as a way of retaining ownership of in-game items, outside of that game.
That sounds great, but its totally dependant on developers developing their games around that.

And it doesnt even guarantee exclusivity.
Anybody can take the file linked to the nft and copy it.
You can buy a 5000,- sword nft in a game and i can get the same sword by simply copying the file.

And if you implement some way to prevent this, you're also implementing a way to prevent the usage of outside nft's in your game.
Which is the one thing nft's claim to be useful for!",hyn1pdm,2022-02-27 13:08:17,joeri1505,[],/r/NFT/comments/mdf7nl/just_minted_my_first_nft/hyn1pdm/,1,0,,1,0,mdf7nl,comment

NFT,What does it takes to earn $100k from NFT art? Insights from crunching the data.,"I crunched the data on 100 artists who have earned $100k-$199k revenue in NFT sales to find out what they were creating, where they were selling and what scale of audience they had. Here are five key insights I found:

&#x200B;

1. The most popular artistic medium amongst the $100k club is Animated 2D with **31.2%** of creators using this format. 2D art without animation is a close second at **28.6%**, followed by Animated 3D at **24.7%** and static 3D at **15.6%**. [https://media.giphy.com/media/PjySjeak3mRI4/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PjySjeak3mRI4/giphy.gif)

&#x200B;

2. More than half of the artists $100K club sell on more than one platform, the average being two. [**SuperRare**](https://superrare.co/) was the most popular amongst the sample group followed closely by [**MakersPlace**](https://makersplace.com/). [https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYvOjkBiEB0zjTq/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYvOjkBiEB0zjTq/giphy.gif)

&#x200B;

3. The median average sale price of NFTS by artists in the $100k club is **1.033 ETH ($1,835.69 as of today)**. [https://media.giphy.com/media/67ThRZlYBvibtdF9JH/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/67ThRZlYBvibtdF9JH/giphy.gif)

&#x200B;

4. The average number of artworks sold by NFT the artists in the sample group is **114**. [https://media.giphy.com/media/FxIFLUg6RUcVO/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/FxIFLUg6RUcVO/giphy.gif)

&#x200B;

5. How big of an audience do you need to build to make $100k as an NFT Artist? The answer isn't as large as you'd think.  Artists in the $100k club who use twitter have an median audience size of **2,032**.

Also, having a larger audience did not necessarily mean that artists could achieve a higher sales price per NFT. As the plot below shows having a significantly bigger audience did not have a proportionate effect on average sales price. Artists with smaller and perhaps more engaged audiences earned just as much, if not more, from each NFT as their more popular counterparts.

&#x200B;

**Parameters**: These stats include sales made on MakersPlace, KnownOrigin, Nifty Gateway, Foundation and Async Art. All the numbers are based on initial sales only, not the cut of secondary sales taken by the artists.

NFT,,"Sorry.. but twitter audience size is *completely* unrelated. Few artists care about twitter, it's all about Instagram behance etc. Visual portfolios are the key

Edit: *completely* is too black and white.
I just wanted to point out that an artist's exposure to his pre NFT audience is not through twitter but other visual portfolios.
So his buying audience is more likely to come from outside

NFT,,"It took 12 hours and Kinoko san's team of 4 people to create it, then the model, Lisa, was bound and only had 15 minutes before her body could not withstand the binds anymore.

This extremely short time window gave us limitations to what kind of data we could capture to create the 3D model. Also the restrictions within Pixar's AR system were very difficult to work around but we made it and made a breakthrough.

The name Samsara reflects the binds which we are here, the shape of the art behind her, the halo, so a reflection of Lisa though bound, is fighting the binds of Samsara through her finite and limited time in this universe.

Samsara captures all of this beautifully and allows the artwork to be displayed wherever the user wishes. It's fine if you can""t see the value in art like this but that doesn't mean that others can't.

NFT,,"The best argument I’ve seen is for sneaker culture. You have a token that can be traded in for a shoe. But a lot of times in sneaker culture, people don’t actually want to wear the shoe.

Yet you still own the rarity via digital commodity.

NFT,,"I would agree, that and the benefit of verifiable authenticity via the nft. And being able to wear or display the item virtually in the future. And to be able to resell them instantly and virtually. 

It’s essentially the same value proposition for pieces of digital art like this as well, where the inherent value of a pair of shoes is replaced by the intrinsic value of a pair of art. Just like the sneakers, the value of the art will be dictated by the scarcity of available tokens and the demand from buyers. The first nft’s were just sold at a reputable art auction in fact. 

The unfortunate aspect that many do not realize however is the actual nft “item” you are buying is merely a tiny token on the blockchain, not the full piece of digital art. You are entirely dependent upon the host of the actual art to keep it up. For instance if NBA Hotshots went down permanently all the owners would be screwed. 

This is why decentralized hosting will be the next big issue to sort out for nft’s imo.",gymil32,2021-05-18 22:17:22,AdmiralUber,[],/r/NFT/comments/nf8rum/world_first_japanese_shibari_nft_by_hajime_kinoko/gymil32/,1,0,,1,0,nf8rum,comment

NFT,,"The feels.

2008:

Me: gets fine art/graphic design degree in 2008
Parents and everyone else: -_-

2021:

Me: has gone corporate to pay the bills, focuses on corporate design & marketing assets

Everyone else: $$$$$$$$$$


I’m super happy at all the attention the art industry is getting and hope it continues. I also hope that investors can share the love and invest in lesser known artists, especially those who struggle to get the means to even just make digital art. I was broke for years, finally got a comfy job (admittedly thanks to my design experience) and as of the last twelve months could invest in a nice laptop, iPad (and now some gas lol), software, etc. for my own personal digital art. there are a lot of people who can’t afford this which is sad. Crazy crazy times. Would love to see the wealth start to spread out a bit but it’s not shaking out just yet. Perhaps when more buyers enter who want to collect the actual pieces for home display, or online display etc. instead of flipping things may even out a bit?",gqm39bx,2021-03-11 20:29:32,P0tat0eater,[],/r/NFT/comments/m2sz5f/you_know_if_i_invert_the_sentences_it_still_makes/gqm39bx/,18,0,,18,0,m2sz5f,comment

NFT,,"Honey slowly dripping off and leaving a trail could help make it more realistic, make the honey move the way honey would. Bears are curious and they are also predators so they might be looking around for food or possible hunters or territorial bears. For example if you were to make a tree you could make the leaves blow in the air, add some ants, mushrooms, termites, give it a glossy look from the rain, add moss, etc. As Bob Ross would say adding these small details gives the painting life.

The NFT is very well done and the first thing I thought of, when I looked at it, was this is a honey bear. With those ideas you might figure out where you want to go with it and you might think that most of those ideas weren’t good enough and you can come up with better ones.",hu3xmzm,2022-01-25 03:47:04,Cachesystem,[],/r/NFT/comments/sbpdr1/honey_bear_liquid_animals_series_feedback_is/hu3xmzm/,3,0,,3,0,sbpdr1,comment

NFT,,"My understanding is a burned token is sent to an inaccessible address, not “deleted from the blockchain.” Nothing is deleted from the blockchain; by design.

No credible NFTs are hosted by a single company. That’s just a straw man that Reddit keeps telling itself. They’re generally hosted on IPFS, which is decentralized and where anyone can host a copy. There is no single entity that could force the others to remove the item. Lots of NFTs are also on arweave, filecoin, or even directly on chain itself.

It is *possible* to build an NFT with a single centralized host; in the same way it is possible to build a website that phishes people with malicious links. Just because it can be done doesn’t mean all websites do it. The only NFT projects I’ve seen with a centralized asset url were built just to make a point (the flawed point you’re repeating) for internet clicks.

NFT,I came to this sub to learn and read discussion but it’s just people advertising their art.,Can the mods either generate a thread solely for discussion OR a thread solely for linking to store pages for NFTs? As a newcomer this sub just looks like an art show and not a place to actually learn and discuss. I got more out of the stickied “what is an NFT” thread than any other post in this sub.,m20f7f,2021-03-10 15:46:04,Senpai_Onyx,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'discussion'}]",/r/NFT/comments/m20f7f/i_came_to_this_sub_to_learn_and_read_discussion/,587,0,130,587,4,m20f7f,post
NFT,,"Currently the subreddit has various flairs, as follows.

I would be curious to know what one might recommend we change, as users can filter by flair on the right hand side.

\- merch

\- NFT

\- Request

\- Community

\- Looking for work

\- Technical

\- VR/AR

\- Discussion

\- NFT swap

With Ethereum partnering with Reddit, and Reddit IPOing this year, there might be ample room to discover additional features and integrations into the sub.

Currently we are working on a grant with Gitcoin, which can be found here that displays our current snapshot intention of our thinking (open to community input): [https://gitcoin.co/grants/2204/rnft-2](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2204/rnft-2)

DMs open if interested & becoming a moderator aligns with your values if either: 1) solving this problem technically, or, 2) if you believe there to be a better strategy

NFT,,"Sure.
IMO, if we consider NFTs as an art and/or investment, we should also consider future value of NFTs, and what will be traded in the future as well, not just what we like. I think that’s an interesting idea and hard to find out",gshpeda,2021-03-27 19:06:27,NFT_PillS,[],/r/NFT/comments/meeoo9/my_artwork_shared_thousands_of_times_is_now_nft/gshpeda/,5,0,,5,0,meeoo9,comment
NFT,,"No. Art is to be treated entirely different than fungible investments, even from a profiteering POV. If you are trading stocks, money, gold, oil, etc., there is divisibility in the system, and that division allows a market to form where there are multiple buyers and multiple sellers. The price will be at the pint where there is the most overall surplus in the market (including both buy and sell sides). 

However, when an asset is non-fungible, he who values it most will inevitably become the owner. This is especially true in auctions. 

So how do you set yourself apart? Well, there are a number of ways. Obviously, you pick good art to buy and not shit art. Second, you see artistic value that others don’t see. Additionally, your value system can eventually become so good that you start CREATING value with your collection. Your ownership is seen as a value in and of itself, because you have a good taste in art.",gsi536l,2021-03-27 20:28:09,DolosTheSpy,[],/r/NFT/comments/meeoo9/my_artwork_shared_thousands_of_times_is_now_nft/gsi536l/,7,0,,7,0,meeoo9,comment

NFT,My number one question about NFT’s: the screenshot issue,"My friends have been hyping up NFT’s as the new hottest thing but I don’t understand what makes them so valuable...

I can just take a screenshot of it and then it’s mine.

Their argument is that I don’t have the unique serial number, to which I respond, I don’t care, I have the art the same way you do. 

Why should I pay $10,000 for an NFT that can just be screenshotted. 

Am I wrong?

Note: I do think they are awesome but please convince me of why they are valuable",lulldy,2021-02-28 17:39:17,Cheese-pickle,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'discussion'}]",/r/NFT/comments/lulldy/my_number_one_question_about_nfts_the_screenshot/,559,0,495,559,8,lulldy,post
NFT,,"Man walks into art gallery, snaps photo of $20,000,000 painting, instantly painting's value becomes $0.

NFT,,"So... I‘m late to this discussion but I recently googled the same question OP has, which led me to this discussion. u/Cheese-pickle I agree with you. I don‘t see the value of an original that doesn‘t really distinguish from it‘s replica - especially when the replica is pretty easy to make by basically everyone on this planet. The art gallery analogy doesn’t really suit the question. If I have an NFT and a screenshot of it, then the only things different between these are as OP calls it the „serial number“ and maybe the resolution of the underlying picture. Other than that both are just pictures behind a glass screen on your computer.

When you consider a classic peace of art and compare it to a photograph of it, then you‘ll find a lot of differences. If you buy the Mona Lisa you can smell the picture. You can feel the picture. It‘s an antiquity that has survived hundreds of years made by one of the greatest geniuses in human history. If you buy that thing, you‘ll think about the history it has and the fact, that it’s been stolen a hundred years ago, which adds to its story. Even the frame of it has a value as an antiquity. Now, I dont‘t say that digital art isn‘t creative or that NFTs can’t have a story or a history behind them or that they can‘t be masterpieces with a lot of work put into it. But the fact, that the difference between the original and the replica is so tiny makes me seek for a justification of the difference in their value. Sure, you can replicate a classic piece of art not only with a photo but also with a poster of the same picture, but the aforementioned differences remain.

NFTs are all hype, because they got a lot of attention through the prices that people paid for Beeples art. But I think people will start to rethink the value and whether or not the serial number and a better res are really worth a significant price difference. Even Beeple himself said that this is just a huge bubble (that he‘d be dumb to not profit off).

Laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks etc. don’t matter if you just like the art making a screenshot of it and using it as a background on your pc or if you want a print of it or a picture on a digital photoframe. They only matter when you want to make money out of it by reselling it. This sure makes the original worth more than a copy since you aren’t allowed to sell copies and profit off of somebody else’s intellectual property if you don’t have the rights to do so. You acquire these rights by buying them, but imo the differences of an NFT and it’s copy don‘t really justify the huge difference in their value. Once the bubble pops and people start reevaluating their NFTs, their value might decrease significantly. However, the price is made by supply and demand. And if people are still willing to pay these huge prices for their NFTs, then so may it be.",guoh4kz,2021-04-16 02:22:40,Extension_Emotion392,[],/r/NFT/comments/lulldy/my_number_one_question_about_nfts_the_screenshot/guoh4kz/,10,0,,10,2,lulldy,comment

NFT,,"Scarcity and the “real thing” it may not mean a lot to others but does also means a lot to someone else. Just like any physical art piece. 

For example: a really cool painting. Sure you can take a picture of it or get a reprint of it. Same thing right?
Kind of but to people who appreciate it and enjoy the piece if art.. its not the same thing. 

Just look at Pokemon or trading cards there are only certain amounts our there... sure you can get a replica edition.. but I gurantee you won’t feel the same as you would if you had the real deal. Like who knew a PSA 10 Charizard can fetch up to half a million dollars. It’s a piece of cardboard the size of your credit card lol

Exclusivity, it is inherent that humans want to be the “best” or “be at the top” it’s an ego thing to say ‘I am one of 10 people’ go have this thing. Crazy isn’t it? 

For example, the rich love doing this. “This is the only ferrari or lambo that looks like this or this is the one of 5 car’s in north america with this option pack and I have it” It’s such a brag and ego thing to make them feel good that they have something that nobody else has. Dumb right? But it is what it is


FOMO is also another real factor, I can see the feeling of FOMO play a large role especially in these beginning stages of NFTs as the space begins to evolve. Which plays into the exclusivety factor.

One thing I’ve learned being in ecommerce and collecting is.. never under estimate human behaviour. Its weird. Just because YOU won’t doesn’t mean others won’t aswell because there are A LOT that will.",gp74i5l,2021-02-28 17:51:30,tonyrehab,[],/r/NFT/comments/lulldy/my_number_one_question_about_nfts_the_screenshot/gp74i5l/,3,0,,3,0,lulldy,comment

NFT,,"Since people are asking, here's how I made this:

1) Create all separate layers of art in Adobe Photoshop  
2) Export individual layers as transparent PNG files  
3) Import PNGs into Esoteric Spine  
4) Use spine to turn the pngs into Meshes and add bones and weights to control how much the meshes deform as the bones move (twitches on face, wavyness and other perceived movements)  
5) Create animation sequence in Spine, and export your animation as a transparent image sequence  
6) Import image sequence into Adobe After Effects.  
7) Create the audio (I used Ableton Live, software instruments, bass and my Rhodes piano layers with effects/eq/compression) Make sure to ""export as a loop"" and time it perfectly to your video length.  
8) In After Effects - create your timeline, do the reverse of the animation, add the sacred geometry thing and the shiny light rays, add the color hue shift, add audio  
9) Export video as uncompressed MOV file.  
10) Use Adobe Media Converter to turn MOV file into an Mp4 video under 50mb  
11) Wait and pray for cheap gas fees...  
12) Upload / mint and list on Foundation. :)

NFT,,"The other drawback to NFTs are that they're usually just a jpg file and if I'm not mistaken you ""own"" it but it's still on the marketplace that you purchased it from.

Don't get me wrong, I'm an artist of sorts too but for sure the real potential for NFTs hasn't been seen quite yet, even for art

But I agree that physical paintings aren't anything special all the time. They just have the bonus of being a decoration or having historical value. Maybe today's NFTs will have that historical value too",gxia2iy,2021-05-09 15:48:19,Melo_Mono,[],/r/NFT/comments/n8fh47/when_someone_says_nfts_are_easily_replicated_and/gxia2iy/,9,0,,9,0,n8fh47,comment
NFT,,"You own it but you can move it to your hardware wallet, showcase it on opensea.io and other platforms and showcase it on meta worlds across some platforms, ie, have your own art gallery in virtual worlds. Essentially you hold a token that says you own edition # of a certain artwork. The jpg can be replicated but not the token. Same as an original physical piece. Some artist do include a physical piece, which I like. Paying 2k for something purely in the digital realm is difficult to swallow but essentially I believe this yo be the birth of the next art movement. Already in the making but this will be looked back upon as an awakening.

Lots of pros and cons but 10 years from now the art angle will have matured into something else. And yes there are many more other use cases for NFT’S, land ownership, documents, car titles, etc.

Gas prices are high but hopefully layer 2 solutions on eth and other chains will come.

No offense but yeah, there’s like millions of art being produced that is a joke but there are great pieces out there and some from established artists, urs Fischer for instance. Unfortunately it has been a money grab of late and I blame this on artists and on the platforms selling as well.

NFT,,"Here's the thing, because those paintings are painted by individuals and not replicated by a computer, each painting will still be unique. There will be slight differences in brush strokes and colour mixing. The thing that makes IRL things like these unique is the artist's touch. With NFTs the thing that makes them unique is their digital ID. Has nothing to do with the artist xD actually kind of insulting to an artist imo.
Main point behind NFTs is to create artificial scarcity which is something a business cares about, not an artist.

NFT,,"Wow...and it's sometimes so hard, even for art experts, to tell the difference between a fake artwork and a genuine one...that unless you're 100% sure of the provenance of a certain work of art, you can never know for sure that you're paying thousands or millions of dollars for a genuine painting at an auction. And the truth is...also in the physical art world, everything depends a lot on ""opinions"", impressions, and someone's verdict. A painting might suddenly be worth millions because someone says so....and that's enough for a general consensus. And you're paying millions, not because of the work of an art master itself, but because of attributions that might or might not be correct...(they are just someone else's ""expert opinions""). This is especially relevant when considering time periods when art was not traditionally signed. All you can do is rely on gut instinct and a keen eye for detail. But then again, great masters usually worked with their pupils...so you can never be 100% sure of who really is the creator of your masterpiece. 

People who believe the NFT world is subject to fraud, theft, and forging issues....might have not taken a deep look into the physical art world.",gxlqseg,2021-05-10 13:07:58,marbemg,[],/r/NFT/comments/n8fh47/when_someone_says_nfts_are_easily_replicated_and/gxlqseg/,2,0,,2,0,n8fh47,comment

NFT,,"Well depends, I guess what time frame you’re referring to. I guess artist or musicians do it for the love first and if they make money, then it’s the ultimate icing. Money is the ultimate driver for most things, but artists and musicians are willing to starve for their craft, as much as they’d prefer not to. The impression with nft is they have no purpose at all except to serve as a vehicle for an investment. A digital form of art is for example dependent on electricity and some form computing circuitry, whether it’s your desktop or iPhone, and a screen of course. This is just to view it. I guess to show ownership you may only need some identifying numbers or characters stung together in a coherent fashion to be read by a computing machine. alternatively, traditional art relies simply on a canvass where the art piece is put on and maybe a frame to hang it somewhere where the recipient can enjoy it when they look at it, less clutter in the way to enjoying of the artwork.

I get what both of you are saying. I am not so sure the physical piece is 'tied' to the NFT in any other way though. I'm sure in the future if there are smart contracts designed so that the physical item must be transferred, there will be lawyers specializing in blockchain ownership to enforce those contracts legally.

NFT,,"Yeah, you read it right. 1 free NFT for each and every one of you. Dropped straight into your wallet, and we'll cover the gas.

Moglets are the most adorkable Crypto Monsters. They exist on Pixel Cards, crafted with epic RNG. We surpassed 100 adoptions on [Moglets.com](https://Moglets.com)… then we surpassed 250! To celebrate, we're giving everyone a free Moglet: Bunnz

Bunnz is both special and totally not special. It's special because you CAN'T adopt a Bunnz on Moglets.com. It is exclusively obtained through promos like this one. But it's not special because, well… it's stats aren't RNG like the rest of the Moglets. Claim yours now. We'll be dropping a free Bunnz for everyone here through the Polygon network. This is what you need to do to claim your free Bunnz:

1. Upvote & make a comment!
2. Join our Discord: [discord.gg/McmZsuckP2](https://discord.gg/McmZsuckP2)
3. Post a link to your OpenSea account on Discord in #get-bunnz. **Your OpenSea account MUST have an NFT in it (that you didn't create yourself. You can always get a Moglet at [Moglets.com](https://Moglets.com))**

Thanks to everyone who has supported the Moglets project so far. While these are collectible in nature, we're working hard to bring some pretty cool utilities to these Crypto Monsters. Keep an eye out for developments on our Discord. See you there!

Edit: Should have enough for everyone… though technically there are only 1000 Bunnz. So just in case some miracle happens and we run out… you'll know why. 6 already given out at the time of this edit!

Edit 2: we handed out a TON of Bunzz so far, and we’re still in the process of handing out more. Thanks for your patience!!!",gz8yroo,2021-05-24 07:07:29,MogletsOfficial,[],/r/NFT/comments/njrw1m/1_free_nft_for_every_redditor_here_get_your_bunnz/gz8yroo/,80,0,,80,0,njrw1m,comment

NFT,,"Osaka Sunset

I was cruising around Osaka with a bicycle in 2016, searching for anything interesting to photograph. I spotted this highway above the city and next to it an overpass for pedestrians. The long stairs to the overpass gave a nice view of the surroundings, but the light wasn’t very appealing. I decided to wait for the golden hour to kick in. It took an hour or two, but I think it was worth the wait.

Somewhere in Japan is an ongoing photography series by Lasse Erkola that began over a decade ago.

NFT,,Except these interactive AI/ VR NFTs are not really on the blockchain anyway. The jpg monkeys aren't on the blockchain either so the part that is on the blockchain is the same for both. Hopefully it's at least an IPFS link. Other than that it's just a proof of ownership so it doesn't matter if you represent it with a link to some interactive 3D element or not. You can use the picture of the monkey to be ownership for a 3D interactive element in the future. The symbol that represents them is really not as important. The only exception to this rule is when there is actual built in differences to the smart contract and that is almost never the case.,hjhk049,2021-11-06 00:05:23,vorpalglorp,[],/r/NFT/comments/qna95l/nfts_are_in_the_record_era_and_im_in_the_3d_vr/hjhk049/,2,0,,2,0,qna95l,comment

NFT,,"Uncomfortable opinion: most of the horrible shit that's said about the NFT community is correct. Most of them are bad people being dishonest and looking for investments and to get rich. The quicker the better.

And almost every promise of amazing tech built on the blockchain or NFTs is bullshit.

The value of an NFT is in the fact that it is a digitally unique token. Doesn't matter if it's for a painting, image, 3d model, song, video, whatever. All that can be copied. And if it's cool, expect it to be. The real only value is that you can prove where it came from with the blockchain.

But even that isn't a guarantee. Most people will never build a name that creates worth in that digital uniqueness. A few people will. The crazy part? Inevitably some cloned work will be more popular than the original work from the artist. That will happen.

NFTs aren't the future of anything. They're cool tech that exists here and now, and can disappear tomorrow.

I don't recommend anyone buy any token on ETH. Yes it's long-lasting, but it's too dirty to justify. Find a cleaner token. And then only buy things you like and/or want to support, not because you think it will go up in value. To do otherwise is to buy into marketing bullshit that hucksters are pouring in constantly, and influencers trying to make a buck off of you. Buy what you like, and at least your money will go to someone you can be proud of supporting.",hjicq82,2021-11-06 03:53:50,QuentinRAnon,[],/r/NFT/comments/qna95l/nfts_are_in_the_record_era_and_im_in_the_3d_vr/hjicq82/,1,0,,1,0,qna95l,comment

One black eye won’t fix another, and saying because ‘x’ only earns ‘x’, he shouldn’t make this much is just completely the wrong mindset. You don’t have to pull other artists down to lift others up.

NFT,,"Ok so spotting promo scammers can be pretty easy. Take a look at their actual posts, how many real looking comments do you see? For an account with millions of followers it should be in the hundreds on each post.

There are hordes of scammer accounts with bought followers, bought likes, and bought comments. They then charge people for promo that realistically will be seen by maybe a handful of real people.

Don't do it.

Never pay for promo unless you actually know the person.

Instead, join promo groups, post yourself, be active in your community.

Stay safe ❤️",hkipst5,2021-11-13 23:52:26,MichelleHartAUS,[],/r/NFT/comments/qt6rz7/this_38m_follower_instagram_account_scammed_me/hkipst5/,6,0,,6,0,qt6rz7,comment

NFT,,"No offence meant when I say this but you might be offended.  So apologies beforehand: if there is no market (yet) for your NFT, what makes you think there is a scam?   


I'm likely missing something, it happens more frequently than I'd like...  


But I don't see how offering to send someone an NFT that, by admission:  


a. doesn't ""take that long to make"" and;  
b. one that doesn't ""cost \[you\] nothing (sic) to mint or transfer""   


in exchange for a promotion from (what would appear on the surface) a 3.8M follower instagram account counts as being ""scammed"".

NFT,,The scarcity bit is a good point although you can do it in other ways too. We've been having limited editions until now as well. The manufacturer/seller can tell how many pairs they've sold and put a number up on the website if needed. The problem I see mostly is to do with returns and refunds. Not all sneakers sold will be Yeezys.,gyjx21m,2021-05-18 10:29:55,Twitxx,[],/r/NFT/comments/nesmdx/releasing_my_first_sneaker_collection_as_a/gyjx21m/,2,0,,2,0,nesmdx,comment

NFT,,"Your work is quite interwoven and very symmetrical and the details are good.     

One of my favorite artists from back in the 1500's, Peter Bruegel the Elder, did  a series of these kinds of works.  They were incredible. 

His technique would be to start with a drawing, Graphite on Paper, then finish in pen and ink.  All done by hand. We'd look at one of the many works he did like this today, and think ''Impossible'' 

I have no idea of how they had the patience back then.   Bruegel also did similar engravings which were the new thing of that time when printing from copper plates was taking off big time.  

I like to throw a bit of art history out there for people, just for the fun of it.  

Keep up the good work and check out Bruegel,  You may be a kindred spirit of his in the Realm of Art.  Great Artists from the past leave behind messages in their works which can only be seen by a kindred spirit.  They can direct you.

NFT,,This got me thinking. It's fashionable now for people to slag on artists for getting into NFTs.. but the reality is that many artists are in advertising all the time (I'm reminded because this would fit in a short advertisement. I don't intend it as an insult - this would be good work regardless of where it is). I consider NFTs more ethical than advertising and it motivates work with better aesthetics.. and everyone's gotta get paid.,gw1sutp,2021-04-27 13:48:05,NewFolgers,[],/r/NFT/comments/mzmgku/they_say_its_weird_and_i_agree/gw1sutp/,3,0,,3,0,mzmgku,comment

NFT,,"It’s basically saying the buyer has the original. All other pieces out there are copies. The hard part for anyone including myself to understand is, you don’t actually have anything physical. If I was to buy an original art piece from a gallery I am walking out with said piece. If I use imaginary money from a bank I am purchasing a physical piece. NFTs don’t do that. They just give me a statement I own the original but I own nothing physical. It also doesn’t stop the artist from selling the same piece in print (physical form) to others. Other buyers are going to be oblivious that I own the original because no one will say It and the artist won’t change all future sales of said pieces as copies. That’s why a lot of people are confused. If we buy NFT and now we own the original and get a physical piece with it that would help. On top from now on all future pieces of said art have to state they are a copy unless forged by others then it gives some piece of mind to owners. I am still learning about this and trying to find answers, I see the potential but I also see the problems as it’s a very new concept, same as everything else that just emerges.",h1136yj,2021-06-08 14:07:15,Phuzzypeach,[],/r/NFT/comments/nun2au/light_amidst_darkness/h1136yj/,1,0,,1,0,nun2au,comment

Then i've decided to join Quartz (Unique). Unique was chosen by United Nations to provide a NFT platform to a climate program.

Is it possible to apply a sort of randomness to the apparent motion in your visual animation rather than repeating circular motions? 

This seems Very very close to low dose LSD and is reminiscent of the VW Bus scene from Taking Woodstock or scenes from Enter The Void. If you were able to make selective colorpatches and textures drift off the page on their own plane it would be hard to differentiate... kind of like the Reptile Scene in Fear&Loathing! 

Either way it’s really cool to see your work! I would love to see it overlaid on some of my deepdream composites!",hz4zp2x,2022-03-03 03:36:06,RaoulDuke209,[],/r/NFT/comments/t5cmjb/hi_all_im_making_an_animation_similar_to/hz4zp2x/,1,0,,1,0,t5cmjb,comment

During a typhoon in 2018, I ducked into an alley to take shelter from heavy rain and winds and stumbled upon this scene. A man was resting, calm and comfortable at the end of the alley rolling a smoke.

It was one of those perfect moments that you live for as a street photographer and it's a photo that will always serve as a reminder that you never know what is waiting around the next corner.

NFT,,"I like what you did with the reflection off of the plastic.  That gives the work the most pizzaz.  Adds a nice zip to the rotation.  

I'm an artist who's been painting and sculpting for over 50 years and I want to try my hand at NFT's.  I've had dozens of shows in Museums and elsewhere but big deal.  Those shows and awards never put food on my table.  

My problem was that people liked my work but rarely ever bought it.  It was too whatever for them to put in their house.  I get it.  I wasn't the artist that painted or sculpted pretty things and maybe I was a bit outspoken on some social issues.  But I didn't want to go along quietly. 

The NFT collectors seem more open minded when it comes to Art so I'm gonna give it a shot.  

Now all I gotta do is learn more about NFT's.   I'm sick of learning.  I just spent 6 months learning new programs on building a word press site and it's taking forever.  It's there, but I've only got about 50 works showing and that's only a drop in the bucket.   

So now I'm going to have to put it on hold again and jump into NFT's . 

One thing I read about them is that I need to get involved in social media.  I've never done that.  I did get a Twitter account but never used it. 

I read that I should follow people who are into things I like. So I'm going to follow you.  Check out my half finished site if you want.

NFT,," Shplub is very happy to present: Slice of Life  

A showcase of hexahedral slices encapsulating idyllic realities.  

The first slice, Jungle Ruins | 001, is limited to just 10 - available now on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:386433:0xaba2f3f01da71db8da0fa35b07997f0ed49a2973).   

Everything you see and hear is conceptualized and designed completely by Shplub.  

Hidden deep in the forgotten jungle lies the crumbled remnants of an unknown tribe. The symbols depicted on the stone represent a language that's almost alien in nature. Who, or what, left these mysterious carvings in an area so secluded from the developed world? And what was the goal of such efforts?...",gsarrxd,2021-03-26 15:07:01,shplub,[],/r/NFT/comments/mdqn2o/slice_of_life_jungle_ruins_001/gsarrxd/,2,0,,2,0,mdqn2o,comment

NFT,,"Man, sorry to bother you with so many questions, but I'm an absolute newbt in this and don't want to mess up.  
I wanted to ask you, did you mint that first NFT directly on Rarible, after you got verified?   
I haven't minted my first because I'm a little confused about the process. For example, I don't know if what would happen if I mint my NFT in opensea or [mintable.app](https://mintable.app) and then I want to list it on Rarible. Can you do that?   
What would you recommend me to do to mint my first?",gs2d8ou,2021-03-24 16:33:02,Aeon_Nine,[],/r/NFT/comments/magi38/just_got_verified_on_rarible_and_this_is_my_first/gs2d8ou/,1,0,,1,0,magi38,comment
NFT,,"Hey, all good! I'm not an expert either but I'll answer the best I can with what I've learned.
I haven't minted on Rarible yet, cause of gas prices. I first started minting on Mintable, using the free Mintable market. I just recently got my first mint through on OpenSea when gas dropped for a bit.
As far transferring tokens, I think rarible is using the ERC-721 token. Which as far as I understand is easily transferable to any other market using the same ERC-721 token, like opensea or mintable. It will cost you gas though.",gs2la1t,2021-03-24 17:29:24,jefharris,[],/r/NFT/comments/magi38/just_got_verified_on_rarible_and_this_is_my_first/gs2la1t/,2,0,,2,0,magi38,comment

**That's 100% correct!**

**1 FREE Monas NFT** (Matic blockchain) for every single one of you, delivered straight to your OpenSea account, free of charges (we pay for the gas)!

We are celebrating the launch of Monas, a unique project made of 10.000 different Mona Lisas combined with all the craziest internet culture references!

Monas are generated programatically and there will never be two identical Monas in the official collection!We have a healthy community, growing day after day, and in order to celebrate this success we're offering everyone the possibility of owning a Mona completely for free!

**This is how you can claim your Mona NFT:**  
\- Upvote and write some nice comment;  
\- Join our Discord here: [https://discord.gg/AcfQm5HHed](https://discord.gg/AcfQm5HHed)  
\- Go on #reddit-promo on our discord and paste the link to your OpenSea profile;

This is a commemorative Mona, not part of the main Monas Collection on Ethereum.

Please note that in order to avoid spam requests and people claiming multiple Monas, you need to have at least 1 NFT in your account (can be anything).

If you got super excited and you don't yet have an NFT, go ahead and get a Mona: [https://opensea.io/collection/monas](https://opensea.io/collection/monas) (0.02 ETH)!",nl0pki,2021-05-25 21:37:29,MariaAlicePT,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Giveaway'}]",/r/NFT/comments/nl0pki/everyone_is_getting_1_free_nft_today_we_even_pay/,364,0,322,364,10,nl0pki,post

I'm still figuring out the best ways to promote, but my best tip so far is - promote on twitter! There is a huge NFT community there. I've spent about a month straight on twitter, doing things like - posting my NFTs, posting non-NFT art, commenting on people's posts that interest me - in order to try to make genuine connections and friendships, etc. Just put in the time and try to make friends and garner a following.

NFT,,"This NFT is the first of my Inflatable World collection. It's about the overuse of plastic, over-consumption, and the waste problem. By some companies the desert is being used as a landfilling, this NFT showcases inflated plastic cacti and canyons.

Inflatable World is a collection of high quality NFTs that showcase our world created of inflated plastic objects. This collection will contain 20 unique NFTs/images (3840 x 2160 pixels) from which 5 of each will be available.

Another example, Picasso’s paintings of women are partly so successful because of the sharp shapes and angles he used to portray them and the fact that he was a womanizer.

Hello r/NFT!

We are Patrn[,](https://mondriannft.io/img/2177.png) and we are here to do a giveaway to celebrate our new NFT launch that began yesterday - [https://mondriannft.io](https://mondriannft.io).

This giveaway will begin Sept 17 at 3pm EDT and be open for 15 hours.

Mondrians are a collection of 4096 Free-to-Mint Generative Vector Mondrian-Inspired NFTs. They are part of our free-to-mint series of 20th-century art-inspired NFTs you can find at [https://art101.io](https://art101.io/). For owners of[ a http://nonfungiblesoup.io/](http://nonfungiblesoup.io/) NFT early-minting began September 16th. Minting begins September 19th @ 10 PM PDT for the general public.

**You can win:**

1 - A [https://nonfungiblesoup.io](https://nonfungiblesoup.io/) NFT (#0323) + 0.05 ETH. The soup can NFT will give the winner early access to the Mondrian mint, and the 0.05 ETH should be more than enough to cover the minting fees.

2 - A [https://goodboisociety.io](https://goodboisociety.io/) NFT from our first collection of NFTs that we launched in August.

3 - 1000 Reddit MOONs.

**Rules to participate:**

1. Upvote this post
2. Drop your ETH address and comment anything you’d like to add

We’ll use the tool at [https://www.redditraffler.com/](https://www.redditraffler.com/) to select the winners. **If you win the nonfungible soup please be aware that you will only have about 36 hours left in the reserved mint period to mint your Mondrian NFT before general public minting begins.**

Also, **if you are considering buying a nonfungible soup on Opensea to mint a Mondrian, please check if that soup has already been used here** [**https://mondriannft.io/soup.html**](https://mondriannft.io/soup.html)**. Each soup can only be used once!!!**

Paintings' preeminent purveyor of Neo-plasticism, Piet Mondrian' created a 'new art.' His work focused on simple shapes and primary colors. His paintings stood in stark contrast to the popular aesthetic of the time, Art Deco.

His work isn't referential. It's pure abstraction. Paintings that reflect on an underlying spiritual order and in doing so create a universal visual language. A pictorial vocabulary like the one constructed in Mondrian's work is the underlying foundation of all generative art. MondrianNFT.io is a high-fidelity investigation of Mondrian's work. MondrianNFT.io spans the entirety of Piet's multiple styles, phases, and formats, with a rarity that reflects his real-world collection to create 4096 unique images.

NFT,,"Guys I don't think that account's really Elon. I actually had an NFT created by that account and it's no longer in my account - I'm assuming the Rarible management took it down somehow... which is strange since I was a fool and thought it was really Elon and bought the NFT with real ETH. So they take my NFT away but where is the ETH? 🤔  


P.S. I saw this mania took off yesterday on Rarible. The mofo sold like hundreds of these for 0.69 ETH - I wonder if he got to keep the monis (I'm assuming he probably did since they can't gain access to his wallet to take it back).

NFT,,"thank you for the gift to the community Elon.

would be cool to have a 'stanley cup' of NFT showdowns. create a 2x2 tournament of artists, and allow voting to emerge over a certain period of time, people staking with votes.

Rather than thinking about r/NFT in a feed, how might we consider tournaments and themes to compete against, to possible ignite new categories of play.

Just an ongoing showcase with matched artists in a round-robin fashion, with prizes as bounties for performing digital work for launching new brands.

top winner gets the pool from sponsor (companies), proportion of funds sold in the collective makes sure everyone gets paid.

It was entirely predictable that opportunistic scammers would take the opportunity to create scam auctions independent of Elon Musk and whatever NFT he's generated (I mean.. his Twitter replies have already long been a hotbed of crypto giveaway scams -- and it's currently rampant.

Or you use one of these services like Opensea that stores the NFT for you. Then you don't have to worry about maintaining the link.

Then the person who owns it can just do what they want with it. You can offer up the model and everything else they need to recreate it in the link along with the ""video"" itself so they can pull it off the server and put it wherever they want. Otherwise the Link may eventually go dead and they lose it.

NFT,Yahoo Finance Brings Interesting Case Around Artist Ownership,"I was looking around and stumbled on this [Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/digital-art-rights-tricky-nfts-095631835.html) that presents an interesting case between two projects.  One project on Sol started with the artist but then stole their work.  The other project, on BSC, was done at the request of the artist.  

So who is right here?  Digital Eyes has listed the Sol project.  Several BSC exchanges have listed the BSC project which came out a week earlier.  I say the only true project is the team the artist ultimately went with which launched first.  The artwork is superb.

Today I decided to bring my most prized possession into the digital world and give up the one and only trophy I have ever received. With this token an email will be unlocked to redeem the physical asset. This glorious award has sat overshadowed by numerous trophies awarded to my brother as he worked to climb his way up to a professional soccer career. This sole trophy sat there reminding me that no better days were to come. It truly served as dull constant reminder of my inadequacies and helped prepare myself for the mediocrity that my life was destined to evolve into. As I have shared it’s glory with others, some have even exclaimed “you know, are you sure it’s a trophy... It really looks like butt plug, not a trophy?” When asked this question I used to get so furious. This was one of my most prized accomplishments and they were desecrating a this hallowed relic with this comparison. Over time I have learned to shrug this observation off and that I would only be so lucky to have such excitement in my life for this gem to be used in such a manor. Though it has not yet been used in such a way, I now hope the possibility may be out there for others to find that type of enjoyment. This amazing clarity is something that this antiquity empowers and when it’s true glory is revealed. This brings me to today, where I am finally looking to part ways with this heirloom. For its power no longer has use to me and it is best to release it out into the world.  Now middle aged and hitting peak mediocrity in my life, I no longer need the constant reminder that I will never have a life to be envied or admired. It’s now time to pass this on to someone who has truly yet to accept the fact that the stale boredom that is their life will never change. Serving as a magical artifact this trophy can truly remind its owner that it’s okay not to be great and that there is no reason to force something that will just never happen. This, a true power that no other item in this world can bring. Good luck to every sole that will posses this treasure in future and please use its powers wisely!",gt53uyj,2021-04-02 14:03:08,Jack_Dalton1988,[],/r/NFT/comments/mikzmf/my_first_and_probably_last_nft/gt53uyj/,14,0,,14,0,mikzmf,comment

NFT,"Musée, the first user-owned gallery and marketplace solving the problem of visibility for cryptoartists. This will be the next big thing in the NFT space.","[Telegram](https://t.me/museeart)

[Website](https://www.musee.art/)

NFT sales in the first quarter of 2021 total more than $2 billion.

You read that right - $2 BILLION.

And Musée is the best way to grab a piece of digital real estate that can help you cash in on the trend.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a collector or a creator, this is a project you’ll want to own.

It’s an NFT-owned marketplace built upon a finite number of digital plots (10,000 to be exact), so it’s like the Million Dollar Homepage of NFTs. The difference is that the creations here are permanent and ever-evolving thanks to the tech that NFTs provide.

By owning a plot, you get to sell and share creations or NFTs from the collections directly on the grid. And unlike other marketplaces, 100% of the plots are visible from the homepage as soon as users land on the platform. In this way, Musée is bolstering the value of NFT art and increasing visibility for creators.

Think of it as the Louvre museum of the NFT world, where you can purchase anything you see and interact with the owners. Creators get massive visibility of their work and all users get to come together and be part of a positive, like-minded community.

And just like physical real estate, plot owners can increase the resale value of their plots. Gain followers, showcase your art and collectibles, and resell your plots and NFTs. Plus the finite number of plots automatically increases their value due to their scarce nature.

This social innovation from Musée will completely revolutionize the way people interact with art and digital collectibles forever.

Launch day is just around the corner, so mark your calendars:

July 20th at 9AM EST

Don’t miss your chance to grab one of the plots for 0.5 ETH. By grabbing a plot, you become part of the next generation of NFT owners.",oiacy0,2021-07-11 18:57:35,GaratJax,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'NFT swap'}]",/r/NFT/comments/oiacy0/musée_the_first_userowned_gallery_and_marketplace/,310,0,11,310,0,oiacy0,post

NFT,,"**What happens to your NFT-linked digital asset when / if the game disappears?  It's gone and won't be re-sellable**

I'm bullish on NFTs in general and optimistic we'll find a way to make them work in mainstream gaming, but people should remember that the item(s) the NFT is associated with are only valid as long as the game is active.

&#x200B;

The lifespan of a moderately successful multiplayer game is on the order of 3-7 years, and only the rarest birds like CS:GO / TF2 / LoL / WoW last 10+ years.  How many people do you think are playing Ghost Recon Wildlands multiplayer right now?  Even what seem like sizable releases on launch might not sustain - Back 4 Blood is at around 10k peak daily players on Steam which is down from 25k peak in November and 65k in October (its release month).

&#x200B;

There is still huge value to players in being able to re-sell a digital asset on a global marketplace for currency they can use to pay for things IRL.  But let's be honest about the risk and lifespan here for most digital items.  At the end of the day you're buying a token linked to a licensed digital asset dependent on the publisher being solvent and the game being active / popular.",hpvgut8,2021-12-25 01:54:51,tellure_,[],/r/NFT/comments/rnq2ze/some_people_only_see_what_they_want_to_see/hpvgut8/,5,0,,5,0,rnq2ze,comment

NFT,,"I see the nonstop arguments on Twitter, which are thankfully dwindling, and they're always

**NFTs are burning down the rainforest.**

* Aside from the differences between blockchains making this untrue, and the fact that everything we do is bad for the environment (hello smartphone you're holding to read Twitter), but this is mostly ignored, never looked deeper into.

**They're stupid/worthless.**

* Meanwhile, I can bet nearly all of the people saying this enjoy art that other's don't like/think is ugly. On top of that, they've probably played games where they've collected loot, and maybe even wondered about how it could have more permanence, i.e., not eventually losing it (servers, corrupted save files).

And it goes around in circles with these two talking points, forever. And it makes me feel like shit, because I make my own NFTs mostly for fun and I really enjoy it. I host them on the polygon blockchain via Opensea and I own my own ENS domain. I'm not burning down a rainforest anymore than someone who plays Warzone, or drives to work.

I think NFTs have an amazing amount of applications, *like not losing things in games that you worked hard for* and building virtual online spaces, which I've been into since I discovered Second Life in 2013.

And I really wish the negativity would make a turn to positivity, because I don't want to feel guilty sharing what I do in my free time, sometimes lol

Edit: Bonus talking point: I almost forgot about how I see people calling those who collect and make NFTs all neckbearded losers, which is hella reductionist because I've met a lot of people in only a month and almost none of them are the type of people these descriptions are related to, and some of them are women!",hpue2qo,2021-12-24 20:07:17,cmdr_nova69,[],/r/NFT/comments/rnq2ze/some_people_only_see_what_they_want_to_see/hpue2qo/,17,0,,17,0,rnq2ze,comment

The concept is, we have mints of x amount, if we fulfill the full mint we proceed with a draw. We announce winners live. Then proceed with another mint. 

The ticket you originally bought is still good for our bonus draws which we go every 10k mints.

The ticket also can have special attributes for extra prizes. 

The difference between ape-lotto and a regular lotto? Your ticket has multiple chances of winning different contests.

NFT,,"Another project I'm involved with has a cool NFT Lotto from staking currency check it out:

Kryptomon is a new NFT game on BSC that is current running a Gleam contest for free KMON air drop. The game is a mix of tamagotchi/Cryptokitties/Pokémon and is focused on creating living NFTs you raise, train, breed and battle. It has a professional game studio behind it that built Call of Duty Black Ops and the only NFT game partnered with Simplex. KMON is also available on pancakeswap so check it out the project as its still a very low market cap under $5m with huge upside potential as the game is launching shortly - its an easy 10x.  
  
Hurry up and don't wait as this contest is just running this week.

would you please join this server with my invite?
I'm trying to get in the whitelist.

It's a generative NFT project but apparently the artist is some very reknown guy and they are building a mountin of stuff like gamified mechanics, a private metaverse, AR models and some large project that they didn't disclose yet.

Sneak peeks of the art also look quite cool to be honest

NFT,,"Congratulations mate!

NFTs are indeed changing lives and I'm happy it made you quite a good amount of money! NFTs and metaverse are still nascent and I believe the earlier you get in the better. Most folks who got in as early birds already made it big.   


I have been digging for early birds catch on some metaverse ecosystems and came across XANA Metaverse. These guys are building their ecosystem on a side chain of Ethereum network. This may sound unique as they seem to be the very first to go along these paths as far as my memory can go.   


Their nft marketplace has already been launched and adopted by the olympics in the display of artworks.   


The team has launched Ultraman NFT which is a popular anime with over 4 million copies sold. This can be another life changing thing which seems to still be under the radar.

**18 Unique Pieces from a limited series of photographies** \- The Search of Art as a mean of self expression  
  
Private collection 2012  
  
Growing up with the upcoming of new responsabilities, I lost contact with my inner self.  
  
This sense of unbelonging came from my distancing from any true means of expressing myself, that is why I decided to explore how I can truly feel fulfilled through art.  
  
This never shared before limited series was realized during the route of self discovery I endured for 6 months, trying to answer:  
  
\- How can I feel more full through art,  
\- How can I escape my dimension and be closer to my own soul by doing it.  
  
Printed photographies and overlays with gold paint, burn marks, watercolor, markers...

There will be a cap of 1 Billion total. Average Chic-A-Dees generate \~8,000 EGGS a day. Legendary Chic-A-Dees generate \~16,000 a day depending on block speed.

Egg owners will be part of the EGG DAO. It's estimated that all EGGS will be generated within 2 years.

Update: The Egg DAO is now growing the Egg Vault which is gathering NFTs to be used to back the EGGS token or resold to build up an endowment for the owners of the EGGs token. It can be spent how the community votes.

Update: An upcoming collection is being developed which will be available to purchase exclusively in EGGS.

NFT,,"Golden Years

I was out on a photowalk at night, randomly scouting the area near the hotel. Just as I was about to call it quits, I saw this slightly sad looking building sitting next to some newer, fancier establishments. It felt like a remainder of what was once a different kind of neighbourhood.

NFT,,"# Deep in the heart of Africa…

…many centuries ago, there used to roam a herd of mythical elephants. Stories of their great power have been passed on through the legends of the local tribes, and paintings of them can still be found in some remote caves on the flanks of Kilimanjaro.

They are described as huge, hulking, but peaceful creatures that watched over the tribes in the area. The tribes worshipped them as protectors of the land and its people. It is said that their tusks were made of diamond, that would glimmer in the savannah night with a thousand reflections of the moon.

Legends state these mighty elephants had the power to heal wounds, dispel sickness, and restore lifeless places. It is said that they could form an oasis in the desert by sticking their magical tusks into the earth.

For hundreds of years there was peace between the elephants and the tribes, and no man dared poach them, not even for their diamond tusks. When an elephant died, however, his companions would offer the tusks to the villagers, just as the villagers would share their crop with the elephants.

That was until a group of traders arrived from other lands. An outcast tribesman, eager to barter with them, struck down the alpha, Valmiki, with a spear. However, when he touched Valmiki’s tusks, his mind intoxicated with greed, he turned to diamond and fell to the ground — dead. With that the peace was broken, and the elephants left, to where no one knows.

Those tusks given to the villagers have been passed down through the generations. Some are held by their ancestors, who use them to protect the habitat of elephants today. Two pairs were found by British treasure hunters, who, after returning across the open sea, put them up for auction on London’s biggest exchange.

Legend has it there is still a yet undiscovered pair, those that belonged to Valmiki, buried somewhere near Kilimanjaro.

# Protecting the Elephants

This NFT was created to commemorate all those who participated in Tusker Finance’s charity drive. The latest charity chosen by the community via a [governance vote](https://gov.tusker.finance/#/tuskerfinance.eth/proposal/Qme2o9N5bLcgtzKnxmG7fog3vcSpZsU5xi5JakQQPMhmxn) was [C.R.O.W](https://www.crowngo.org/), an organization that trains and equips rangers in their battle against elephant poachers.

Our previous donation was given to [Wild Tomorrow Fund](https://www.wildtomorrowfund.org/), an organization preserving elephant habitats in South Africa.

NFT,BSC's DegenPunks NFTs Soars Past 4300 Mints +++ Unshakeable Degen Community +++ Organic Growth of over 700 Unique Holders +++ Gain 3% Holder Rewards and Lifetime 7% Original Minter BNB Royalties +++ Marketplace Imminent!,"Degen Punk$

&#x200B;

Over 4300 DegenPunks already in the hands of 700+ new owners!

&#x200B;

Only 10k maximum DegenPunks will ever exist, minting live now:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

🚀 [https://www.degenpunks.com/](https://www.degenpunks.com/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR/What's happening so far:

&#x200B;

👀 4300+/10k DegenPunks already in the hands of new owners

&#x200B;

👀 See Rarity Rankings and Attributes on the Website

&#x200B;

🍉 So, what are DegenPunks?

&#x200B;

A 10,000-strong army of randomly generated degenerates with varying attributes to establish exclusivity. Like you and me, each Degen Punk was created to be unique and exists in the blockchain forever, a reminder that Degens never die.

&#x200B;

🍉 Why should I ape?

&#x200B;

The ORIGINAL Minter wallet of any DegenPunk gets 7% LIFETIME BNB royalties of every buy and sell transaction of that specific DegenPunk on our upcoming Marketplace.

&#x200B;

When they're gone, nobody else gets that benefit except you.

&#x200B;

\*Additionally\*, Holders get 3% of every buy and sell of any DegenPunk in our upcoming Official Marketplace, paid in BNB. The more you hold, the more rewards you get!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

MINT YOURS NOW AT:

NFT,"Finding NFTs before they Explode, 10 repeatable NFT trading strategies and when to use them","One of the most important realizations to make about the NFT market as a trader is to understand that there is a critical difference between trading NFTs versus trading crypto (or stocks).

The difference with NFTs is that the people you are competing with in this market are sill, just people. Sure you might be competing with whales, people with trading bots, and insiders, but you aren't yet competing with banks, hedge funds, algorithms, etc (I call this ""big money""). It might not seem that crazy, but think about it this way. All of these entities exist for a reason, to make money. Actually, I'd argue that these entities sole purpose is to make rich people richer.

But, as we all know - there is tons of money to be made in NFTs, so why aren't they apeing in? There are a few reasons

\* it's still relatively new and unknown

\* they are an absolute nightmare from a legal and tax perspective

\* Ethereum gas fees

But the absolute primary reason (I think) is that every single transaction needs to happen through a wallet, and automation is inaccessible short of hiring some (ultra expensive) web3 developers (basically, the dev scene is in its infancy).

A few friends have been telling me to get out of NFTs, and that they will crash soon due to the supply issue. But in my opinion this is the absolute worst time to get out because once the ""big money"" comes (and they will come) there won't be much left for the rest of us.

The key to success in trading NFTs is to have a robust trading strategy. This is something the average NFT trader does not have, which is why many of them end up in the red. They either trade quickly, wiping out any gains they might make with the gas fees, or HODL, never selling and in most cases riding a dead collection to 0. I find that these are two ends to a spectrum, and the sweet spot is usually the middle.

I personally have fallen into both of these traps, but over time I've discovered a few strategies that work regardless of which direction the market is moving.

What's cool about NFTs is that they are all hype (not all hype, there's utility, gaming use-cases, staking/passive income, etc. but hype and attention is what governs price 90% of the time). This means that a ""crash"" in the NFT space is less like a crash in broader crypto - where everything falls together, but more like the sneaker space, where a few brands might suffer, but overall the market remains healthy. So knowing what collections people are interested in (and knowing it early) is a massive competitive advantage.

(speaking of which - sneakerheads did/are doing very well in the space)

There is no shortage of cool projects, with celebrity backing, innovating, amazing art in the space. So how do you keep track of them all? and how do you decide where to put your money? Here's what I think:

*For extra alpha, see my write-up over at* [*https://chilly.tools/blog/10-trading-strats-nfts*](https://chilly.tools/blog/10-trading-strats-nfts)*, where I add some charts to visualize the strategies and explain how to use the* *chilly.tools* *bot to automate finding tokens with each strategy*

There are only so many strategies that can realistically work at any given time. And their effectiveness is inversely proportional to how many people:

1. Know about them
2. Use them

Not all strategies are created equal either, there are strats for when:

1. the floor is going up
2. the floor is going down
3. the floor is going sideways
4. Event-based strats

I've compiled a list of all the strats I've encountered and used, with varying degrees of success. I'm sharing them here because there's another bull market coming, and a rising tide lifts all ships.

It goes without saying that you'll make the most money when the market is moving, especially with proper tooling, but there are also tons of strats that help you make the most of a sideways market. Below I'll divide the strats into different sections, and order each strat from most competitive to least competitive.

But first: four things

One: Almost all of these strategies deal with NFT rarity, if you're here I'm assuming you know what that is, but if not, \[here is a good explainer\]([https://raritytools.medium.com/ranking-rarity-understanding-rarity-calculation-methods-86ceaeb9b98c](https://raritytools.medium.com/ranking-rarity-understanding-rarity-calculation-methods-86ceaeb9b98c)).

Two: How can I tell if my collection's floor is going up or down?

Good question, Opensea offers average price under the activity tab, but this is 1. daily, and 2. not the floor. You can check floor movement [here](https://Chilly.tools/floor-trick)

Three: In the various market conditions below,  you will see duplicate trading strategy names. Make sure to read through them though, because they mean & function slightly differently in different contexts.

Four: This is not financial advice, always be careful and DYOR. The smartest bets are the ones that look good that you also believe in.

**Strats for when market/collection floor is moving up**

This is likely when you can make the most money, if you are careful.

1. (most competitive) Floor hunter - when the floor is rising, you'll often find yourself getting out-gassed for any floor-priced NFTs, unless you have a bot and are ok with spending extra gas, I'd recommend shooting for NFTs 10-20% above floor price, because if floor transactions fail, you're still paying gas fees (yes failed txns still cost gas)
2. Straggler sniper - for many collections, especially if the collection has just experienced a sharp drop, people will have listed their NFTs at a certain price which might've been fair relative to rarity at the time of listing, however, as floor goes up, many people end up being slow to update their listing. If you can score a 1 ETH rank 500 on a collection with 0.7 floor, thats a huge win. Here's a graph of rarity vs. price to illustrate what I mean:

This is a killer strat because it ends up costing gas to cancel and re-create listings to raise prices, which means it's a great opportunity for us to snatch something unfairly cheap.

3. (least competitive) Arbitrage (avg vs floor) - Arbitrage (or more aptly described as price discrepancy) is very common in the NFT market. There are not enough big players in the market yet to jump on these opportunities before us. There are many different flavors of arbitrage that I've seen work for NFTs, and I'll probably write another post explaining all of those if this post ends up doing well. Avg vs Floor is a discrepancy which is hilariously unutilized. Basically, its common for the floor price of a collection to move, but the average stays roughly the same. Lets explore both possibilities:

* Floor moves up, avg stays same: the more common of the two scenarios. When this happens, any listed NFT that was fair price before the floor movement is now cheaper. In this case, grab up any NFT listed before floor movement that was listed at a fair price among similarly ranked NFTs in terms of rarity, quickly re-list at the new fair market value which you can get by doing (new\_floor\_price/old\_floor\_price) \* previously\_fair\_listed\_price. Easy flip.
* Floor moves down, avg stays same: You need to be careful with this one, the collection may keep falling, personally I wait a few hours before entering into anything with this. In this case, the current floor NFTs are cheap compared to the average, and it would now be a good time to enter at floor, or exit at average, depending on the market condition for the collection.

NOTE: be sure that there hasn't been some event which is making the market move, this only works in a pure market

**Strats for when market/collection floor is dropping**

Currently, there are no derivatives that let you take advantage of a falling collection (think shorts, put options, etc.) - however, there are still ways to make money on the way down.

1.(most competitive) Floor hunter - It's common for people to panic and list way below floor to get out as soon as possible rather than risking selling for even less. You can take advantage of these by grabbing them up before anyone else gets the chance. Actually [chilly.tools](https://chilly.tools) has a feature which scans for these every 5 seconds and just pops up the metamask right away.

* Careful - this is like catching a falling knife, I'd highly recommend knowing why a collection is tanking before using this (exmple: Jungle freaks)

1. Rarity floor sniper - this one is less accessible to most people because looking up rarity obviously takes time, and the faster you are able to know the rarity of a specific NFT the more of an advantage you have. This strategy assumes that there is a direct correlation between rarity and the price of an NFT.

* Such a correlation would suggest that only looking at the floor and sniping near it means you are missing 90% of snipes. What we can do instead is estimate the fair market price by looking at NFTs with similar rarity that sold recently, and compensate for any floor change that occurred. By taking the difference between our estimated fair market price and the listing price, we can find out whether this listing is cheaper than what the market things it should be.
* In practice, there ends up being a really strong correlation between rarity and pricing, meaning this is one of the best ways to get ahead of the crowd.

1. paperhands hunter - nervous people reducing price

* You'll often see people listing their NFT lower and lower, as they get more and more nervous that their NFT won't sell. These are often good tokens to put on your watchlist, and maybe make some lowball offers on. It's highly likely that (as long as the NFT doesn't sell to someone else) you'll be able to get a really good deal.

Careful when using these strategies - you'll want to be very confident in your decisions here, because it could be like catching a falling knife. As with anything on this list, be careful and DYOR. You'll want to be very confident in the collection to buy on the way down, and depending on how fast the floor is falling - flipping can be very risky as well.

**Strategies for when market/collection floor is flat**

1. (most competitive) Liquidation hunter (hunt NFTs when someone needs to urgently liquidate)

* Sometimes Holders hear about an opportunity so lucrative and time-sensitive that they need to liquidate their holdings right away, so they'll list their NFT way below floor. This is an amazing chance to scoop up an extremely cheap NFT before anyone else can. Careful - many people watch a collection when the trend is flat, meaning you're likely going to have 2 or 3 people simultaneously trying to scoop this one up. I'd set the gas higher when checking out.

1. paperhands hunter - Its common for people to be getting nervous when a collection stays flat for several days, look out for anyone constantly reducing price - it's an easy flip for when volume returns.

**EVENT BASED**

Below is a list of strategies that work when certain events happen in a collection's life-cycle

1. mint - this one is somewhat obvious, but when a collection first goes on sale, or ""mints"", there are a few strategies which are very lucrative

* whitelist - This one is a lot of work, but it is the most surefire way to secure a few cheap tokens out of a collection. Basically, it just involves being a good community member for the NFT collection. So that means: inviting people, being active, saying gm alot, or contributing. I personally don't do this unless I really believe in the team over anything. It's a lot of effort, and other strategies have been more lucrative in my experience.
* mint bot/gas bot - an alternative to whitelisting is to be one of the few who can score an NFT during mint without being on the whitelist. As you can probably imagine, this is incredibly hard to do, and you have to get quite lucky. Many popular collections have 1000 tokens (if not less) available for >200k people. You can increase the odds of securing a token by using a gas bot which will automatically increase gas until the trade goes through. Again, not something I personally do, but has shown great results for others.

1. rarity reveal - once a collection mints, its very common for the actual art (and therefore rarity) to be hidden. Meaning that at this point, every token appears the same as any other. However, a collection will then designate a ""reveal date"" when all art will be revealed at the same time. Typically the collection floor will then pretty quickly diverge: the rarer tokens will be listed for much higher, while the most common tokens will often get listed for half, if not less, of the previous floor price. The two strategies I personally look to take advantage of are:

* (most competitive) mispriced tokens - many tokens will stay listed through the reveal, meaning that there is a chance a super-rare token is listed for near-floor price. This is however almost impossible to take advantage of without a bot, as this can be a pretty easy 1ETH+ flip. [Chilly.tools](https://Chilly.tools) has a bot for this which will pop up the metamask so you can buy as soon as possible. I'd recommend increasing gas for this as well.
* Cheap tokens - its typical for the collection floor to slump shortly after the reveal. If you're bullish about the collection, this is a good time to swipe up a few cheap tokens if you weren't able to during mint. In my experience, the collection floor will reach an absolute minimum anywhere from an hour after reveal, to 2 days after.

All of these strategies will work best during high-volume periods. You want there to be a buyer on the other end.

Remember even with these strategies, this is an arms race. You wont win on every trade, but the goal is to come out expected value positive, ideally while minimizing the analysis you need to do.

As of writing this, floors are rising across the board - it's a good time to enter if you were on the fence.

That's all I have for this post, if this ends up doing well, I'll write another about arbitrage and keep sharing my knowledge.

Good luck and WAGMI

NFT,"FrenchFellas NFT Minting is live! French Connection Finance – $FCF – Has released its first NFT collection | Win up to $20,000 USD if you mint “Gotti the Don” | Or win $2,500 USD by minting a Legendary NFT! | Male and Female NFT MATING | Metaverse Art Gallery to display NFT collection!","FCF has released its first NFT collection 2 days ago! over 25% ALREADY MINTED!  This collection consists of 2,000 French Bulldogs with various attributes and rarities, rightfully named the FrenchFellas.

The islandboys made a video about the collection, Tyrone TOO! Much more celebs are getting on board.

You can breed male+Females and get baby NFTs!

Nine prizes of $2,500 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints a Legendary NFT. A grand prize of $10,000 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints the infamous “Gotti the Don”!

With over 12,000 FCF holders and only 2,000 NFTs, there will be a high demand and low supply, ensuring that these unique NFTs will be trading high on OpenSea.

Only 100 of this first collection will be female Frenchies. Procuring a female Frenchie will allow you to breed with a male Frenchie, thereby giving you the opportunity to mint more FrenchFellas when the second collection drops!

One lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive an airdropped Legendary NFT & $2,500 USD at 25% MINT!

A further lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive $20,000 USD when minting ends!

2 plost of land in the metaverse are going to be purchased by the DEV and turned into an art gallery and club to display and sell your beautiful NFT collection!

Part of the proceeds of this project will be donated to a French Bulldog animal shelter.

NFT,FrenchFellas NFT Minting is live! French Connection Finance – $FCF – Has released its first NFT collection | Win up to 140 000$ just by minting!| Male and Female NFT MATING | Metaverse Art Gallery to display NFT collection! NFT Game under creation,"FCF has released its first NFT collection 2 days ago! over 25% ALREADY MINTED! This collection consists of 2,000 French Bulldogs with various attributes and rarities, rightfully named the FrenchFellas.

You can breed male+Females and get baby NFTs!

Nine prizes of $2,500 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints a Legendary NFT. A grand prize of $10,000 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints the infamous “Gotti the Don”!

With over 12,000 FCF holders and only 2,000 NFTs, there will be a high demand and low supply, ensuring that these unique NFTs will be trading high on OpenSea.

Only 100 of this first collection will be female Frenchies. Procuring a female Frenchie will allow you to breed with a male Frenchie, thereby giving you the opportunity to mint more FrenchFellas when the second collection drops!

One lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive an airdropped Legendary NFT & $2,500 USD at 25% MINT!

A further lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive $50 000 USD when minting ends!

2 plost of land in the metaverse are going to be purchased by the DEV and turned into an art gallery and club to display and sell your beautiful NFT collection!

Part of the proceeds of this project will be donated to a French Bulldog animal shelter.

NFT,,"Thanks, and glad you liked the art! 100% agree with the cool art/VR overlap. 

I think there's some real opportunity in both. Games are probably easier, just because they tend to endure & grow more, so if you buy an NFT in that world, it's easier to re-sell (I think). Speaking of, I stumbled on this earlier, might want to check it out: https://www.sandbox.game/en/

I've bought a couple art pieces, and I think it can be risky. It's all speculative, and you have to be lucky to re-sell certain pieces. I try to buy art that I both like and can afford, so if I can't re-sell it's not a big deal.

NFT,,"We are pleased to announce Tusker Finance's first charity auction. Each week we aim to collaborate with artists to create high quality NFTs. All proceeds will go to elephant conservation charities. All transactions happen on the Ethereum blockchain, to maintain full transparency.

Our last donation was to Wild Tomorrow Fund. You can read about it here:

[https://www.tusker.finance/wild-tomorrow-fund](https://www.tusker.finance/wild-tomorrow-fund)

For our first auction we have something special. Found by treasure hunters near Mount Kilimanjaro, these ancient tusks once belonged to the mythical Diamond Tuskers. You can learn more about the lore behind these mythical creatures here:

[https://www.tusker.finance/the-tale-of-the-diamond-tusks](https://www.tusker.finance/the-tale-of-the-diamond-tusks)

This is a 24 hour auction. It will begin at 2PM PST on Friday, April 23 on Rarible. At the end of the 24 hour period, the highest bidder will be given the NFT. 100% of the proceeds will go to our next charity donation. This charity will be chosen by a community vote, however we only chose charities that accept Ethereum to ensure transparency.

NFT,,"I like the way this is moving up the ladder but the thing and the matter is that we need more crypto like Meta Game Hub to give real value to the NFTs through an unique way of using price oracles, with no other competitors really. We will all have to eventually face the fact that NFTs aren't moving in the right direction, loads of art being sold for nothing because of the ones disturbing this still fragile echosystem, the non-artist ones.

NFT,,Cool animation! Fun project! But one birb is 200 dollars right now. That’s expensive... Cryptokitties had a rarity based pricing model. You could get two common cryptokitties and mate them but they were never more than a few dollars. Are all birbs created equally? And can birbs mate with each other?,gtcynnz,2021-04-04 16:22:41,anjunabeatsuntz,[],/r/NFT/comments/mjtc12/finally_launching_an_nft_that_ive_been_working_on/gtcynnz/,1,0,,1,0,mjtc12,comment

NFT,,"I'm not trying to shit on your project, I hope you succeed and make a killing off of these things. Lambos as far as the eye can see... 

I'm not being pretentious or pedantic, it's just that the main thing about NFTs is their uniqueness. Rarer combos or rarer attributes would sound better as a selling point. It gives the consumer a sense that you expect them to understand how they work instead of simple-speaking to them. It reeks of bullshitty salesmanship and snake oil to say that some NFTs are rarer than others. It's like when stores jack up the prices and then offer a percentage off and call it a sale. Being obviously loose with wordage never fools consumers enough to compensate for the trust you lost from the ones that aren't idiots. It comes across as real ""scammy"".",hbq05rv,2021-09-05 19:35:14,Mares_Leg,[],/r/NFT/comments/pia7zv/luna_lander_nfts_from_lunaland_brand_new_limited/hbq05rv/,2,0,,2,0,pia7zv,comment

NFT,,"I'm one of the early supporters of the project and love that 50% of sales goes to an animal voted charity! Was only going to buy one at first, but couldn't help buying a few more knowing it was going to a good cause lol. They just donated their first $5,000 in sales to a dog shelter in Poland called Poolse Asielhonden. I also like the fact that they are giving to smaller charities who could really use the extra help!

NFT,,"Yes, it is the Golden Bridge in Da Nang (as I stated in my comment). It is usually really crowded, however I went there the last day of the holiday (as I was expecting people to be heading back home). So I had the bridge almost to myself. On top of that, it was really foggy that day (which was perfect for moody shots). Not sure what you mean by not original. I'm pretty sure you won't find a lot similar shots (most of the ones you'll see will be with sunny weather and full of people).

Congratulations

Can you tell me on which site you will launch this? (like rarible etc)

Also, can you explain to me few things? Am kinda noob in these.

I have deployed a nft on rarible and it also shows on my trust wallet. If I send nft to a etherium wallet using trust wallet, and if that guy also have a rarible profile, will my sent nft will be showing on his profile?

Also, this thing also works for BSC wallet too? I am currently working on a project and want to create 4-5 nfts (with multiple copies) and want to send to approx 50+ guys with trust wallet. Will this work?

I am choosing BSC because of very low fee.

How much is an approx fee on ada transaction? Is it like BSC? If I create NFT on ada network and want to send it to people, how will they see received nfts? (as trust wallet do not currently support ada)

NFT,,No - as u/greenmansavinglives points out most NFTs are limited by file size constraints. The Cardano native token metadata size limit is 16kb. Most .png .jpeg .gif files will exceed that many times over - they must therefore store media on IPFS and use the tokens as pointers to an IPFS hash...IPFS does not guarantee permanence so this approach is flawed in that respect. We use SVG for our artwork which has a number of advantages. #1 SVG is an extension of XML and can be converted to a JSON string easily. #2 SVG is lightweight when optimized and rarely exceeds 8kb per file. #3 SVG represents a vector graphic and can be scaled up or down infinitely without losing resolution. We can therefore store the entire contents of the artwork source code directly on the blockchain. When you buy a CryptoPeep you're buying the source code that comprises the artwork file. You can at any point in time parse the JSON string stored in the token metadata and create a new artwork file on your local computer.,hcna5k5,2021-09-13 02:51:52,benzega,[],/r/NFT/comments/pn4hh8/in_celebration_of_smart_contracts_launching_well/hcna5k5/,23,0,,23,0,pn4hh8,comment
NFT,,"I could be wrong, but most of the NFTs are off chain due to their file size. Even the original CryptoPunks point to the media, and only store the token hash on-chain.

I'm new to exploring this NFT world, so I could be wrong, but my understanding is that most NFTs are simply minted tokens on chain that point to a media elsewhere.

Yes, super fragile, fleeting, temporary, what have you. I am researching this further, but please feel free to educate me.",hcn8e8u,2021-09-13 02:37:03,greenmansavinglives,[],/r/NFT/comments/pn4hh8/in_celebration_of_smart_contracts_launching_well/hcn8e8u/,7,0,,7,0,pn4hh8,comment

*8Bit Universe* was created by YouTube star (8 Bit Universe) with his intent to grow a tight knit digi and RL community through NFT ownership. Unlike other NFT groups, [https://8bituniverse.io/](https://8bituniverse.io/) establishes a roadmap of events filled with air drops, collaborations, metaverse expansions, and RL meet & greets. The roadmap is already robust. And it's set to fill with more content. Lastly, this isn't just limited to commoners. Social Media influencers are quickly responding. **Individuals such as LORD KSI are already 8Bit members**. This just launched *YESTERDAY*.

NFT,,"People should focus on solid projects, investing should be thoughtful and wise. 

  
I was doing my research lately and I have found ""SuperBid"" - they are celebrities' NFT marketplace which allow influencers to immortalize and sell unique moments from their lives as NFTs.

  
What convinced me to invest in this project?

* there is no crypto knowledge needed to join this app 
* they have already attracted the most famous influencers from around the world, such as Logan Paul and Amanda Cerny (they also wrote about it on their twitter) 
* they are very active and helpful on social media
* they have the craziest marketing campaigns EVER!

1. SuperBid sponsored Logan Paul in his fight against Floyd Mayweather 
2. Billboard on Time Square 
3. SuperBid will be the first altcoin which will land on the literal moon in 2022! 
4.  Official sponsor of the WTA event

This team in not slowing down and their app is launching in September 2021!  
Check them out in the meantime!

NFT,,Crypto supports criminality thru the internet. People can't exactly charge drugs to their debit card and sending cash is not very safe either. Crypto is worth money not because it has value but because supply and demand for the currency to perform transactions on the dark web. It's very easy to buy crypto and run a bunch of false transactions to hide its original source. Drug dealers accept crypto as money and can get cash for jt because people need more crypto to buy drugs. Simple.,hovqzue,2021-12-17 05:23:52,xlDirteDeedslx,[],/r/NFT/comments/rhqlpj/sketchy_ape_book_club_join_and_mint_amazing_nfts/hovqzue/,-2,0,,-2,0,rhqlpj,comment
NFT,,"So they integrate 2 stacking pools that are basically cross-chain and it depends on your strategy. The Polygon one is the first to come out and is already running with an APR of about 40% and way smaller fees than ETH. The pools on ETH were just launched yesterday and depending on the locking period you can earn up to 100% APY (these values will not change over time, unlike those from polygon). So basically besides HODLing and waiting for the price to go up you can also earn some sweet passive income and no permanent loss! They have NFT stacking pools coming their way so stay tuned for that!",hotbfyu,2021-12-16 18:51:52,PhillCoins,[],/r/NFT/comments/rhqlpj/sketchy_ape_book_club_join_and_mint_amazing_nfts/hotbfyu/,1,0,,1,0,rhqlpj,comment

NFT,,"Yes, and? I know how it works. It’s just that this criticism doesn’t invalidate the tech or the value placed on it. Value is a concept and can be assigned. Fiat currency works under the same principle. It doesn’t point to the value of gold anymore. But anywhere you can exchange a dollar for goods or services then it’s assigned value is valid. The same goes for NFTs. If the seller and buyer both believe the assigned value of the digital token is the file it points to, then that’s all that matters. Not the “property rights” it does or does not afford. And not the technical aspect of what is stored on or off chain.

NFT,,"Well cryptocurrencies are financial instruments… and the concept of digital property rights that can be afforded by NFTs is largely another example of a financial instrument. But in the case of my comment I am not only discussing speculators “making money off it.” I mean to discuss the exchange of goods and services of any kind using NFTs. Ultimately in many use cases NFTs are representative of value whether that is a piece of art, a ticket for a show, a deed to property, a membership pass, etc. In any of these cases they do function as financial instruments. By discussing them as such I certainly do not mean to reduce NFTs or crypto to only speculative assets. But this is the part of the reality of the current use case. There are of course other potential use cases like record keeping or legal documents. But we aren’t seeing much of that in practice at the moment. So you are right to point out that the discussions boil down to finance. But I don’t see it as a problem, just a reality of the current use cases.

People are pushing games and art sales and private islands based on this technology but can't explain how using ""crypto"" for their idea is better or more efficient than already existing technologies.

When you sell an NFT, a percentage of the sale price goes to the artist, the rest goes to the person selling.

NFT,,"Hello guys I am pretty new on NFT world. I am a graphic designer and digital artist, creating artistic images in my own style.

So my question is, it might be very stupid but still, I have some arts that I want to sell on NFT markets but ETH gas fee is a pain for me. What if I pay for the gas fee once buy my art still won’t get any buyers? I know also in real world this rule goes like “if your art is good enough then someone will buy it” or even if it’s not good relatively, still there might be someone who will like it.
I am checking NFT markets and TBH most of arts are just shitty photoshop effects done on regular images or just extremely basic drawings. But they still get bids.

How does this actually work? Will I compensate the gas fee easily? I am not as good and popular as Beeple, but even really really bad artworks gets sold for 0,5 ETH or something.

Enlight me guys, please.",gr28wv4,2021-03-15 22:28:13,Yomamaismyllama,[],/r/NFT/comments/m5ruuy/my_3rd_nft_the_animator_is_now_available_what_do/gr28wv4/,1,0,,1,0,m5ruuy,comment

One question I get a lot is ""Where is my NFT?"" - The easiest way to see it is to go to [opensea.io/](https://opensea.io/)<Your address here>.

These NFTs are on Polygon, which is a layer-2 for Ethereum. Otherwise the gas fees would have been astronomical and I wouldn't have been able to afford to send these out.

&#x200B;

edit2: 

All NFTs have been sent out! Thank you everyone - we have a lot more coming, including th launch of our main collection on Ethereum mainnet.

Full transparency, this was my first giveaway and I messed up a bit, some people mistakenly got sent more than 1 NFT. To everyone who didn't receive one, I'm really sorry about that. But I'm planning to do more giveaways in the future and everyone who posted here and didn't get one will automatically be put to the front of the line for those.",h8tbd1g,2021-08-13 18:32:31,notrealAI,[],/r/NFT/comments/p3r4ge/post_your_public_address_will_send_this_cute/h8tbd1g/,25,0,,25,0,p3r4ge,comment

NFT,,"**Hey Everyone,**

Today, we are launching our NFT-project, the **""**[Million Dollar Rat](https://www.milliondollarrat.com/)**,""** and wanted to share it with you.

Million Dollar Rat are NFTs of the Sewer City rats operating on the Ethereum blockchain. We have worked with over a dozen artists to create the Sewer city world and its Rats.

The project takes a different approach to NFTs, where you follow the rats on their hunt for the “Golden Rat” and $1m worth of ETH (435 ETH).

The idea is to add a dimension to digital art and collectibles to create an engaging and exciting experience.

Technically, the funds are generated from the sale of the NFTs, and will be moved to a secondary contract that only can be unlocked by the ""Golden Rat"" NFT. The secondary contract, called the Sewer, will hold 435 ETH.

Happy hunting and we hope you like it!

Launching today (Thursday, April 29) at 12pm PST / 3pm EST / 21pm CET on [https://www.milliondollarrat.com](https://www.milliondollarrat.com/)

**About Million Dollar Rat**

· Operates on the Ethereum blockchain.

· 3,310 + 1 unique NFTs (ERC-721 token standard).

· 435 ETH bounty.

· Created by over a dozen artists (one of the largest collaborative art projects on-chain).

Kind Regards,

The Rat Crew",gwah8pk,2021-04-29 12:55:54,Akmantastic_p00r,[],/r/NFT/comments/n13o8v/launching_today_a_first_of_its_kind_nft_project/gwah8pk/,12,0,,12,1,n13o8v,comment

NFT,,"> The bounty is 435 ETH, which was the ETH/USD equivalent of $1m when the contract was deployed on April 21, 2021. In the case of not enough funds being raised from the sale before May 27, the creators have committed and set aside a budget to market the project extensively. If the project is unsuccessful in raising 435 ETH (bounty) + 50 ETH compensations to artists, creators, and developers, the funds stay in the contract until the combined 485 ETH are raised.

NFT,,"These are Galaxy Eggs. Join their discord at discord.gg/galaxy-eggs Launch is imminent! Don’t miss this HUGE project.

**What is (art)ificial? **(art)ificial is an art studio exploring the boundaries of technology and the metaverse. We are 2 machine learning engineers and an art director - our goal is to take a role in the creation and adoption of the metaverse.

**What is the 'Galaxy Eggs' project? **The 'Galaxy Eggs' is a 9,999 Eggs generative project of the 'Galaxy Eggs' of the metaverse. Around the year 2,100, the world fully transitioned to the metaverse - during this 'metaverse big bang' 9,999 eggs were created and spread out in the metaverse. (art)ificial's journey begins with the community finding and minting those eggs, but this is just the beginning.

**When can I buy a 'Galaxy Egg'? **Primary sale will be announced soon and will be held on our website - www.artificial.art  <>  Secondary sales will be on OpenSea.

**What will mint price be? **Mint price will be set to 0.085 ETH + gas fees.

**Where can I join giveaways? **Giveaways will be held in the giveaways channel of our discord as well as our twitter. Be sure to follow us and turn on notifications at twitter.com/galaxy_eggs

**Can I get the 'Galaxy Egg Early Adopter Role'? **Unfortunately, the role was reserved for the first 100 people to join the discord. Nevertheless will we add more roles as the community grows, so there is something for anyone.

**What are your plans for the future? **Our future roadmap will be released on the website before launch. You will be able to see all we have got for you before deciding whether to buy an Egg.

**Gal Barkan is our art director - Gal has been envisioning and working on 'metaverse art' for years. We are finally here to build it together.

NFT,"SolChampions 10,000 NFT Collection","SolChampions is a collection of 10,000 NFT cards on the Solana blockchain. They can be used for an up-and-coming YuGiOh/HeartStone style game where you can choose a card to duel against your opponent. Wagers can also be placed on each duel and the winner takes it all. Tournaments with over 50 players are also coming. The devs made a Medium article detailing how a duel takes place and how each stat of the card influences the outcome. Holders are also rewarded weekly with fees from secondary market sales and there's a buy-back-burn system that will burn floor priced cards. Really affordable mint price starting at 0.1 SOL and increasing by 0.1 SOL every 1000 cards minted. Devs said they are pushing hard to release everything this month.For me, looks pretty unique for the space, DYOR.

 I'm also doing something in the geographic space....although mines not quite as technical or beautiful as yours. Its quite a bit simpler.

Anyways I'm quite new to this whole thing, but one of the things that is advised is to reach out to people who share a common link. And yours really kind of does....so I'm reaching out to you. If your ever interested in conversing...talking about stuff for NFT newbies...or collaborating...then hit me up.

Oh...almost forgot...my idea [https://opensea.io/collection/confluence-collection](https://opensea.io/collection/confluence-collection)

NFT,,"I just had to raise my NFT ask prices on Nifty Gateway because they're selling too quick and I like holding a collection. A month ago you could buy art with less than 50 mints for under $100. Now new drops are $999 for open editions that mint 1000. You can flip them for 50%-300% gains or hold and hope you bought the next Warhol. This bubble may burst. So buy what makes you happy because you are supporting the artist.

NFT,,"1 billion dollars huh? That's almost enough to buy out dogecoin and a few games on steam. Hell, I could even make almost two whole payments on my student debt loans. I'd say it's ironic I went into debt going to college to get a degree in Digital Heists, only to have to do heists to pay it back in an unending cycle, but I'm not a goddamn English major. I'm not paid to think. I'm paid to steal.

You knew I couldn't resist you son of a bitch. I'm getting the gang back together. We are going to raid the NFT bank, steal all the NFTs and sell them on the black market for triple, no, even double their worth. We will be swimming in those new cryptos. Buy em' during the dip, then sell when they crash. Stay unpredictable so the feds can't track us.

It ain't going to be easy, but I can't say I'm gonna break sweat heh. Grab your leather hacking jacket and tinted Oakleys, crack open a mountain dew code red, let's break into this mainframe.

NFT,,"Well, of course. NFT's have asking prices, but there's no market price. That's the problem with them being non-fungible. Fungible things, like wheat and Bitcoin, are commodities. There's usually a supply of buyers with bids and sellers with asks. So there's a meaningful price between those points. That's called ""making a market"".

NFTs don't work that way. The price doesn't crash. It stalls. Compare Beanie Babies on eBay. Lots of offers at a few thousand dollars, with zero bids. That's a stalled market.

That's the normal case for collectables. To sell, you have to set up a marketing operation.  Pay for ads, get press coverage, bribe influencers, create a brand.",h6iacky,2021-07-25 19:56:36,Animats,[],/r/NFT/comments/ore681/when_the_art_wont_sell_and_you_be_like/h6iacky/,4,0,,4,0,ore681,comment

NFT,,"I created this collection some weeks ago but haven't found the best way to make noise, all of the art and code to generate them was made by me :)

&#x200B;

I really love all of them but I can't stand owning all because my purpose when creating EtherBeanz was to find new owners for them <3 and yes, obviously make some ETH not gonna lie, but now I only want to find them a new wallet.

&#x200B;

That's why I decided to give away one NFT per addres, just comment down here your wallet and the number of Ether Bean you like and I will list it as private at 0 eth so you will get it FOR FREE.

&#x200B;

For now I will give away only 50, I don't know if this is going to be seen for more than one person (me) but yeah, I think it is a good number to start.

Link: [https://opensea.io/collection/etherbeanz](https://opensea.io/collection/etherbeanz)

**EDIT: The NFT is FREE :) but you will have to pay gas for the transaction, I do not control gas price and none of that fee will go to me, I advice you to wait a few hours until the gas price drops so you can save some eth <3**  


**EDIT2: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up tbh, it is getting hard to keep track of all your messages so I created the official Discord server of EtherBeanz:**  


**Link:** [**https://discord.gg/6xrzggfq2J**](https://discord.gg/6xrzggfq2J)

NFT,FTXDoggies unique A.I. art NFT project + Buybacks,"FTXDoggies is a unique A.I. art NFT project with stunning atypical imagery, but it is more than just art! Community driven project with HODL incentives such as buybacks (previously royalties, but this is to ensure US Sec. Regulatory compliance), real world Hall Of Fame (nick)names and frames of Top NFTs. Most other projects tend to place their focus on working in developing countries, whereas our initiative aims at administering assistance to those in the western world. Abandoned dogs are often placed in asylums and later euthanised if an owner cannot be found for them. Furthermore, the living conditions are usually quite stark as the dogs are subjected to a life stuck in small cages, cold temperatures and extremely little human contact or isolation. Most European charities for dogs have a lack of funding and shortage of volunteers creating these problems. The worst part is the dogs that end up here are 100% domesticated. The situation for wild dogs is terrible, but for loyal abandoned dogs used to domestication to be treated this way is even worse. We want to make a difference in our homelands by choosing a charity that is desperately seeking funding. They take care of abandoned dogs, make them beautiful and healthy again, and find new owners. For this to be successful, however, they need our support so that they can acquire necessities such as: food, safe and well organised institutions and most importantly, dedicated employees.

NFT,,"Based on the comments, it appears that very few understand what polygon is. It's a layer two scaling solution for Ethereum. Please do some research and understand what this means for the network and future gas prices. Another project to look into is arbitrum. We should soon see more and more activity on these layer two solutions. Not only will they have significantly lower gas prices, but will also reduce the demand for Etherum's base layer. A little bit further down the road, the introduction of sharding will further scale the network and reduce transaction costs.

Also, the gas prices in the screenshot don't accurately reflect reality. Yes, they are high, due to all the demand but they are not that high.",hbg2c20,2021-09-03 13:45:29,AndersDander,[],/r/NFT/comments/pgvr8v/can_someone_explain_this_to_me_i_cant_understand/hbg2c20/,2,0,,2,0,pgvr8v,comment

My latest collection, a 2017-2021 retrospective showing my growth and development as a digital artist over that timeframe is being minted at OpenSea on the Polygon marketplace, with prices in wrapped Ethereum (WETH). The only gas is minimal in exchanging from Eth to WETH, and OpenSea makes the process very easy. This is not an ad for OpenSea - if anything it's an ad for my collection! LOL. I'm just so impressed with how easy the process is and how much crypto I save when minting or buying this way.",hbl8fvw,2021-09-04 17:18:59,mibesto803,[],/r/NFT/comments/pgvr8v/can_someone_explain_this_to_me_i_cant_understand/hbl8fvw/,2,0,,2,0,pgvr8v,comment

NFT,,"For sure but not a lot of buyers are aware of polygon, and the market is 98% on eth Blockchain for now. 

I've just learned that recently when I tried to help an artist friend to mint 5 NFT for his project on Open Sea. For any kind of action it costs at leat 200 Dolls until 500 sometimes. He is not even able to answer to an offer. This is so bad for eth... And for newcomers to NFT especially. 

Now that the minting process is started on eth impossible to switch to polygon in any way...

NFT,,"I'm a little confused by Veve - I thought the whole idea of NFT's was for them to exist on a blockchain, and you can only transact with a cryptocurrency to execute these NFT transactions through a smart contract? Questions are simply:

1. What blockchain does Veve exist on, is this a private blockchain?
2. How can you transact with ""Gems"" which are essentially ""Vbucks"" on the blockchain?
3. How do you transfer these NFT's out of Veve's native ecosystem? i.e. selling these NFT's on OpenSea or simply sending it from one wallet to another?",hoc23a5,2021-12-13 03:21:35,RedditorDawn,[],/r/NFT/comments/rf2261/veve_nft_collectibles_first_fully_licensed_nfts/hoc23a5/,9,0,,9,0,rf2261,comment

NFT,,"1. I believe Veve runs on ECOMI which is a token on the GoChain blockchain.
2. Gems are 1:1 USD off chain I believe. They can be sold for ECOMI which is a traditional volatile token.
3. Since ECOMI is basically owned by Veve I don't know that these NFTs are going off ecosystem anytime soon. I'm not familiar enough with the GoChain blockchain to answer beyond that.

I'm no expert on Veve but this is my understanding of what they are doing.

NFT,,"1. VeVe is on GoChain rn, but the NFTs are moving and being reminted on Immutable X. 
2. ""Gems"" allows non-technical people to purchase NTFs with simply a credit card thus increasing the potential userbase. These gems will be able to swapped with OMI token in the future. 
3. Once the NFTs are reminted on Immutable X, they will be tradable on sites like OpenSea and Rarible.

NFT,,"It can be swappable because if Apple take 30% then the value left is 70% of $1 or $0.70 so all they need to do is swap $0.70 worth of gems to $0.70 worth of OMI. 

This is how people are cashing out manually right now. If you want to sell your Gems outside of VeVe, the going rate for 1 Gem = $0.70. 

Also VeVe could run a promo where instead of like other projects does staking rewards maybe they could allocate OMI tokens to allows Master Collectors to cash out at 1 Gem = $1 worth of OMI for a limited time. Just a thought. 

PS. This is also how we cashed out on the Steam Market for CSGO skins. Back in the day, case keys were used as currency (like VeVe uses Gems) to trade and these keys were purchasable in-game for $2.50, but you couldn't cash it out through the Steam Market. If you wanted to cashout to your bank account you needed to sell to 3rd party at about 70% of original cost of the case key ($2.50 x 70% = $1.75). This method started off the Steam Market trades over 10 years ago and it's still going strong today and skins are still breaking ATH. In fact, when crypto dumped today the whole steam market went up by over 20%.",hofg0ue,2021-12-13 21:21:17,SPAZ707,[],/r/NFT/comments/rf2261/veve_nft_collectibles_first_fully_licensed_nfts/hofg0ue/,1,0,,1,0,rf2261,comment

NFT,,"Thank you!

This is a collaboration between myself (a professional visual effects artist) and my wife (fashion designer and illustrator).

We are planning on releasing 13 of these original skulls!

We have different skillsets that combine in a really unique way, so we're aiming to make future collections as well.    


Our goal isn't to mass produce thousands of images with slight changes, rather we want to focus on making smaller and more unique artworks.  


We are also creating holographic prints if people want to support and have a more affordable NFT, so these 'card versions' will be releasing in the next month or so.  They are digital cards but also come with a real physical holographic card.

NFT,,"Well, in a nutshell, i see it as an interpretation of our experience being constantly connected to media and excessively fed with various forms of content. Every day we spend a significant amount of time (be it scattered in small sessions) consuming energy on viewing, descifering, reacting to whatever distraction pops up, especially on our tiny screens. When you think of it like this it does actually produce a sickening feeling, like you’ve eaten way too much - hence the visual translation into the barfing subject. The wires represent the enormous amount of information that we consume to a degree that may or may not become toxic (i think the negative or positive way of seeing it depends on who is looking at it)
Anyway, if anyone interpreted it in another way, i am very curious to hear of it.:)",gqs7hih,2021-03-13 08:46:38,DrCranberry_,[],/r/NFT/comments/m3dn4z/my_first_nft_on_foundationapp_information_overload/gqs7hih/,2,0,,2,0,m3dn4z,comment

Fair enough.

Actually, I was just thinking... Solana SLP allows tokens to pay royalties on secondary transactions of an NFT to the original creator.

This could be the key to allowing a legal re-sale market of games that doesn't screw over devs.",hieevdj,2021-10-28 16:42:22,bretstrings,[],/r/NFT/comments/qhklui/news_gamestop_looking_to_hire_developers_for_nft/hieevdj/,2,0,,2,0,qhklui,comment

NFT,,"Congratulations on minting your NFTs!  Being able to profit from your obvious skill sets 😉 shouldn’t be too difficult.  But it does make it very challenging paying those kinds of fees, especially when minting on Ethereum based NFT platforms.  It may become very frustrating over time paying ridiculous fees.  I invite you then to try out uMint on Phantasma.

uMint has on demand minting for about 20 cents per NFT using the worlds first SmartNFT technology then list on the worlds first cross chain marketplace ghostmarket.io 

SmartNFT technology allows the creator to add various attributes within your NFT including infusing various crypto assets, timed NFTs, even other NFTs multilayered into one NFT, add royalties to be automatically deposited into your wallet each and every time your NFT is sold.  

So minting and selling NFTs has never been so cheap....forever.

https://medium.com/phantasticphantasma/the-smart-nft-3a1ff1c03328

Phantasma is a tri chain, interoperable with Ethereum and Neo with 5k tx/s.   Phantasma doesn’t suffer from the constraints of high fees as found on Ethereum based projects.  Mint NFTs for pennies.  The more you mint the cheaper it gets.  On demand minting allows you to mint up to 1000 NFTs in one transaction.

https://youtu.be/rbw0W7nEtmI

GOATiE has developed their 22 Racing Series Racing game on Phantasma using  Smart NFTs.  They have minted 280k car parts with various performance attributes that the player can buy, build, mint all the NFT parts into one NFT to own and race their car. On Ethereum it would have cost over $300k.  On Phantasma ~$50.  Beta available on Steam with Pavillion Hub, full release Q2 2021.

The Phantasma community is amazing. They have donated Kcal (energy token) to allow digital artists, photographers, musicians, whomever to give uMint a try.

NFT,,"That’s a great idea! I Love that! If my NFTs take off, I’m hoping to add a charity component as well—it would be a collective pool that I would invite input on how to spend. Eventually, holding one of my NFTs could allow someone to have a say in how funds are allocated/spent, but there’s a lot of momentum to build before then!

Thanks for your kind words on my drawing. I thought it would be a fun way to make art more accessible, by giving someone the chance to win it at a fraction of the cost. We’ll see how it goes!

NFT,Just sold 5 NFTs on my first day at Open Sea,"Hey guys, I've been lurking around over the last couple weeks. Saw some cool ideas and learned a lot from you guys. So I decided to give it a go at NFT.

I spent the last 2 weekends working on my pixel art, Cosmic Pals. I created a simple website and a Twitter account to showcase them. Sunday night I created the first collection on Open Sea, minted the tokens and submitted for verification. Yesterday the collection was verified. As soon as it was verified, I paid the initial gas fee tax (around $95 at the time).

Yesterday night I was so surprised when 5 of 16 tokens were sold in just a few minutes for 0.1 ETH each.

Just wanted to thank you guys. I learned almost everything I needed in this sub.

NFT,,"Hey NFT fans,


I made my 'Call Me If You Get Lost' inspired artwork of Tyler, the Creator, into an NFT after it being well received. The sale of this NFT could kickstart my career as an artist, and I figured that showcasing it here could help. I'd love to know what everyone thinks! Thank you :)

NFT,,"Yeah I have had a similar experience on opensea. I paid about $100 thinking my low priced art would sell but until today the most I get is like 3 views. Like everything first and formost the nft art game is a popularity contest. 

Its is deceiving all the hype of massive sales until you work out  that the ones selling all have massive social media presences. 

I was under the impression that opensea or other sites work kinda like ebay where sooner rather than later your item will appear on a common space and at least be seen to be sold. All nft artist who are in it for the money need to consider the fact that a following is a must.

NFT,,"I don’t think this weird hate toward this project is warranted. I think the major hurdles it will need to overcome is having a large following/build-up to the project, incentives for early supporters, and a smaller collection (especially without a major fan base of supporters). I’ve watched even successful artists struggle at NFT campaigns because of major marketing hurdles as well as the hurdle of having to educate their general fan base on crypto.

NFT,,"r/defendersnft Crypto Defenders is a CNFT collectible card game that uses the Cardano blockchain. This game is still under development.  
  
Our goal when designing and developing Crypto Defenders was to bring together newcomers and old school cryptocurrency fans in a game of community-driven conquest, where you could collect NFTs that represented your favorite blockchains and actually use them to commandeer zones in the game world and help your team dominate the map.  
  
A simple, yet powerful Multiplayer experience that transcends the game into the real world. A break from watching the rollercoaster ride of candlestick charts, and a way to make extra cash via the Play to Earn ecosystem.  
  
Our vision was to create a challenging and rewarding platform for crypto users. From new concepts like NFT Staking, NFT level ups, NFT Crafting, In-game betting, and trash-talking to the tried and true governance tokens that will also power the Defenders Project custom marketplace.

NFT,,"Mint and sell-- yes. Approved is whole other story. You can mint ""for free"" after you pay a single time activation fee of minting one NFT. Basically, mint once then mint for free.

Approval is 100% subject to the discretion of OS. They are a business. If you can bring hundreds of thousands of eyeballs to their site via social media, they will approve you instantly. If you have no or little social media presence, it's going to take months if it comes at all.

You can still sell through OS if you aren't approved, but you will never appear in the search history. That's why everyone adds the direct link in the first comment of their posts.

Any other utility from the artwork, signed prints or the like?

NFT,,"https://opensea.io/collection/zacharyscribbles

Feel free to visit my profile to view my artist portfolios, all on instagram (@zachary.scribbles, @the.heartheads, @theheartistartist). There you may view the full extent of my work. 🫀


Update as of 10:54amCST 02/04/2022* * 

NFTs are being listed as we speak and there will be 5 editions of each NFT, so keep a look out! Prices will start at $100.

Furthermore, I want to explain that this collection is on-going and I plan on incorporating more NFTs as along as the artwork remains relevant while keeping its originality. Suggestions for new mental disorders or anything dealing with the darker nuances of the human condition can be made on my instagram page in the comments section. And while I may not always have the time to respond right away, please know I am always reading so they are almost always taken into consideration 

Update as of 6:20pm CST 02/03/2022 * *

Since uploading I have learned more and have decided to upload the collection under the polygon blockchain. I will make 5 limited runs of each NFT, allowing for more ownership to those who hold the concept close to heart and wish to own one. I will include another update with asterisks and the time so you know when it has been done. If you are a potential buyer and have any questions feel free to keep our communication open and comment below.",hveqkcs,2022-02-03 11:52:23,zacharyscribbles,[],/r/NFT/comments/sjha0d/nft_collection_based_on_the_darker_nuances_of_the/hveqkcs/,2,0,,2,1,sjha0d,comment

NFT,AFROXNFT TO RELEASE NFT IN TWO PHASES STARTING ON 20TH AUGUST 2021 ON THE AFEN NFT MARKETPLACE," 

AFEN NFT marketplace is set for launch on the 20th of August and has announced that the platform will be launching alongside the most anticipated NFT project from Africa called AFROXNFT: The beginning. The project is set to mint 250 special NFT in the first phase available at a price of 1bnb on the 20th of August. It is a race against time feeling with this one. 

The AFEN blockchain is an industry leading blockchain startup backed by governing bodies and seeking to revolutionise three key sectors of the African economy: Arts, Education and Real estate. They have successfully garnered the attention of the African crypto community and are industry leaders in the NFT space. With an NFT platform in the womb , you might want to take a look at all the fundamentals that come with the AFEN project inclusive of the $AFEN token.

You can join community on telegram t.me/afenblockchain or follow the AFROXNFT project on twitter.com/AfroxNFT",p6v3go,2021-08-18 16:49:01,Elegant-Fig,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'NFT'}]",/r/NFT/comments/p6v3go/afroxnft_to_release_nft_in_two_phases_starting_on/,161,0,1,161,0,p6v3go,post

NFT,,"Hey frens. If you're tired of slow transactions and expensive gas fees, you should check out alternative blockchains such as Solana. Last week, collections such as SolBears and Aurory sold out in the span of minutes, and hit a floor price of up to 20x in just a few hours. On Solana, to create an NFT collection you cannot simply copy paste code like you can on Ethereum, therefore you are always certain that projects launching on there have a rigorous foundation behind them.

A new project that's being launched on there soon is called the Red Panda Squad: collection of 10,000 randomly generated red pandas, illustrated and hand-drawn from scratch by a world-class artist. Supported by a team of well-connected and accomplished devs (15+ years experience). With only 10,000 red pandas left on this earth, $10 will be donated to red panda NGOs for each NFT that is minted.

If you're interested in adopting a red panda or have any questions, come join the active community in their Discord: [https://discord.gg/MEYCghyytJ](https://discord.gg/MEYCghyytJ)

NFT,,"Looking good... like your collection. That being said, if I'm allowed some constructive feedback...

Having worked in VFX myself (as a producer, not an artist), you could improve the following:

\- the light reflections don't  interact with the ground - it's grass on the ground be the reflections are flat - i think you need bump mapping for the surface you render on- similar to the water dropping, when the water elemental is destroyed - it flows on a perfectly flat surface, not on the real ground - again bump mapping- last one for logic: water & fire and lighting should leave marks on the ground where they step - ground stays wet for water, burnt for fire. and for lighting burn marks where the lightning hits

Just my 2 cents - this would be my feedback if it was a shot on a feature I was working on.

Great work! Keep it up and keep improving!",htsuggn,2022-01-22 22:32:11,FilmFreak1082,[],/r/NFT/comments/sa6wu4/lightning_monster_added_to_my_elemental_creatures/htsuggn/,10,0,,10,0,sa6wu4,comment

NFT,,"I'll share a little more details here, because it's pretty interesting, imho. 

the TL;DR first:

We created a new wine label called Enigma, inspired by the legendary spycraft of the English codebreakers during WWII and the machine they cracked an interactive label you need to decipher using a special key printed on the cork and a virtual Enigma machine. This wine is made under strict NDA from a 100-point winemaker and it's some kickass Howell Mountain Cabernet. We made five unique 1-of-1 labels for this Cabernet, and set up an NFT auction for each. These will be some of the first ever real world asset backed NFTs in existence.

The Label
The package is interactive in a unique way: On the top strip of the label is a code to be deciphered. On the back is a QR code which launches a virtual emulation of the famed WWII encryption device, the Enigma Machine. You need to pop the cork, where you'll find the rotor and plug settings you need to decipher the message. Once you get the message you can ""unlock"" the wine on the drinkenigma.wine website and get access to a special club. It's like Skull & Bones except instead of blood, we drink wine. 

The NFTs
Enigma debuts another world-first by minting a collection of NFTs backed by matching tangible, and very drinkable, bottles of wine. Five individual bottles of the Enigma Cabernet have been adorned with five unique labels, each of which back a corresponding NFT. The auction will be held on Opensea and ends on August 15th. The highest bidder will own the digital version of the label on the Ether blockchain, and take physical possession of the matching bottle.",h7gx2yv,2021-08-02 20:20:06,bluedogwine,[],/r/NFT/comments/owln6h/just_dropped_our_first_real_world_asset_backed/h7gx2yv/,11,0,,11,0,owln6h,comment

NFT,ETH CHAT - NFT communication tool,"Hi guys,

Im working on a project where we can chat with NFT owners by just adding "".chat"" behind their ENS (if they have one) or just simply adding a "".eth.chat"" behind their ETH address.

In example, to chat with me just go to:

[http://xaix.eth.chat](http://xaix.eth.chat)

or

[http://0x2536c09e5f5691498805884fa37811be3b2bddb4.eth.chat](http://0x2536c09e5f5691498805884fa37811be3b2bddb4.eth.chat)

Both of this links will bring you straight to my chat conversation with me.

The purpose of this project is that i noticed that sometimes it's hard to get in touch with NFT artist or collectors digging thru their twitter profile and tring to DM them. With this method, you can esentially have a unique url link for every ETH address or every ENS owner out there.

This project is still in BETA, i'd love for you guys to test it and give me your opinion and perhaps find some bugs and exploit so we can try to fix them before we do a full marketing campaign on this project.

In future we plan to integrate smart contract escrow so you can directly trade any NFT from the chat. (still need to think about this in details, any suggestions are welcomed)

Tell me what you think! Thanks guys!

NFT,,"I've been working on building Oki's World for about 8 years (way before NFTs came around), and since then have painted murals, built toy stores and experiences for people like P. Diddy and Britney Spears, and done several other NFT drops in partnerships with other people. Those all felt like cash grabs so we wanted to elevate any project we started ourselves.

With Oki's World, we're merging the physical and digital, driving forward a story through NFTs, murals, animation, music, and beyond. We also want to change how art and entertainment is created by giving commercial rights to your Oki so you can expand the story and universe. Oh, and 100% of our special edition 250 Super Oki proceeds (primary and secondary) will go to charity.

BTW when we say “We Are All Oki” on our billboard, we mean it. After we mint out at the end of chapter 5 we will hand over all the creation tools to Oki NFT holders to be able to create their own NFTs and story lines. You keep 100% of primary sales and 4% of secondary sales…forever!

**Roadmap:**

20%: Put up an Oki Billboard in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles with custom artwork by Kentaro.

40%: Launch an NFT member-exclusive Oki merch store and an Oki lo-fi radio station on YouTube.

60%: Install 5 Oki Murals around the world, starting with Los Angeles. Murals are painted by Kentaro over 12 months.

80%: Launch the Oki’s World Launch Pad where we enable Oki NFT holders to create their own NFTs around Oki’s World and earn 100% of first mint and 5% of secondary sales!

100%: Activate NFT holder approval voting to approve or reject new projects that are incubated through the Oki’s World Launch Pad.

NFT,An NFT Experiment for a newby!,"I'm new to NFT's, and as a newby with not many social media followers, it's going to be hard to get exposure! Hopefully that will come in time. Anyways, I've created an experiment. I've listed a very basic image of a dot on opensea, it's available now for 0.00 ETH and only 1 minted. Grab yourself a bargain, resell it and let's see how far in the world from its originating city (Liverpool, UK) it can travel! I look forward to your input!

NFT,,"I will be the first to admit we are selling and buying in a NFT bubble. That’s why it’s critical to set yourself apart. Myself, and at least two other artists I know of are only minting limited edition NFT’s AND tangible collectors items that go along with the NFT’s. For example, one gentleman is offering 2.5 foot tall custom figurines with the sale of his NFT, another gentleman who sells music NFT’s is offering an actual cassette with his music on it, and I’m offering custom one of a kind trading cards that will be numbered and distributed with each NFT I sell. I’m only minting 69 1st editions and so far have sold 3 NFT’s in about four days. My clients seem to be very happy with their purchases. 
My number one goal is offer as much scarcity, uniqueness, and quality as possible. In turn, providing the collector with tangible valuable. 

Edit: The way I view my NFT’s and the tangible collectors items that go along with each one is the NFT itself acts an undeniable certificate of authenticity.

NFT,,"Let's face it, at the end of the day, digital artists are cashing in on their renders, because they know that a lot of people don't understand the process. The majority of the crap you see on NFT sites are from talentless people who have got their cracked software, sourced pre-made models, pre-rigged animations and just mushed them together. It's a process that is so cheap and quick to the artist, yet sells for thousands to the consumer. Once people start to understand this, I think you'll see the real talent rise above.",gs2s8p1,2021-03-24 18:18:36,SnowmanMofo,[],/r/NFT/comments/mc5zzv/will_the_nft_hype_ever_end/gs2s8p1/,2,0,,2,0,mc5zzv,comment

NFT,"If any of you still dares to doubt the future of NFTs, read this. It’ll all make sense!"," 

We obsess over trinkets, over status, over neatness, over pride, over amulets that represent our life as one well lived. It makes perfect sense though. We’ve been wired for it. 

It’s hilarious to many, then, to see pixel art of apes, punks and cats go for small fortunes and for inane art and silicon valley mob squad tweets to fetch millions in mainstream auction houses. 

However, we know it makes sense. If it doesn’t click for you yet, read the best NFT market analysis to date:

NFT,,"The way I see it NFTs are merely a way to commercialise your art and manage the right associated with the art. The underlying technology makes assignment of different kinds of rights convenient and easy and I think that’s where the value comes from. The value also stems from the issuer. NFTs true value will come from the fact that the issuer is verifiable. NFTs issued by statutory authorities dealing with title deeds, government identification etc have value because the source of issue can be easily independently verified by others. NFTs are even being used to identify shares of individuals in liquidity pools and again the value is derived from the issuer. The NFT art, while being a proof of concept so to speak is actually detracting from the underlying tech because the ridiculousness of some of what is being sold is restricting more people from seeing the true utility of them.",hwy26x6,2022-02-14 19:40:14,shEep9108,[],/r/NFT/comments/ss9l38/if_any_of_you_still_dares_to_doubt_the_future_of/hwy26x6/,3,0,,3,0,ss9l38,comment

French Connection Finance – $FCF – Has released its first NFT collection | Win up to $20,000 USD if you mint “Gotti the Don” | Or win $2,500 USD by minting a Legendary NFT! | Male and Female NFT MATING | Metaverse Art Gallery to display NFT collection!","FCF has released its first NFT collection 2 days ago! over 25% ALREADY MINTED! This collection consists of 2,000 French Bulldogs with various attributes and rarities, rightfully named the FrenchFellas.

The islandboys made a video about the collection, Tyrone TOO! Much more celebs are getting on board.

You can breed male+Females and get baby NFTs!

Nine prizes of $2,500 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints a Legendary NFT. A grand prize of $10,000 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints the infamous “Gotti the Don”!

With over 12,000 FCF holders and only 2,000 NFTs, there will be a high demand and low supply, ensuring that these unique NFTs will be trading high on OpenSea.

Only 100 of this first collection will be female Frenchies. Procuring a female Frenchie will allow you to breed with a male Frenchie, thereby giving you the opportunity to mint more FrenchFellas when the second collection drops!

One lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive an airdropped Legendary NFT & $2,500 USD at 25% MINT!

A further lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive $20,000 USD when minting ends!

2 plost of land in the metaverse are going to be purchased by the DEV and turned into an art gallery and club to display and sell your beautiful NFT collection!

Part of the proceeds of this project will be donated to a French Bulldog animal shelter.

NFT,SuperNormal - An NFT for the Extraordinary :)," Hey guys!

I just wanted to share an upcoming NFT that I think will do very well, essentially some alpha.

The NFT is called SuperNormal and here is the website as well as their twitter:

[https://zipcy.io/](https://zipcy.io/)

[https://twitter.com/zipcy8888?lang=en](https://twitter.com/zipcy8888?lang=en)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tssgd05eejb81.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88e44fb695aacf591ace3a228e276d1653361613

The artist of the SuperNormal NFT is Zipcy, a Korean artist/illustrator with thousands of followers on Twitter, Instagram and other social media sites. As you can see the art is BEAUTIFUL. It kind of reminds me of Azuki, which just dropped and is doing really well.

Their team is fully doxxed and one of the members is a tech lead at CoinBase.

Check them out if you have time, but I think with the art, team, and their roadmap, this project will perform very successfully.

As always DYOR, but let me know what you guys think.",s3cgla,2022-01-13 23:08:39,yabaschu,"[{'a': ':Ethereum:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/a1xe3g4tykr71_t5_3bx7j/Ethereum'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Ethereum NFT'}]",/r/NFT/comments/s3cgla/supernormal_an_nft_for_the_extraordinary/,148,0,69,148,0,s3cgla,post

""Avex Technologies, which develops the NFT business platform ""A trust"" that uses blockchain technology to give authenticity to digital contents, develops an ecosystem using blockchain technology that can issue, manage, and trade NFTs. Concluded a partnership agreement on the blockchain business with Pte. Ltd. and started service cooperation. This will enable digital content (NFT), which is mainly used in A trust's economic zone, to be deployed in markets used by users around the world.  
  
Recently, new markets for digital content are expanding rapidly around the world, such as digital art utilizing NFT being sold for billions of yen, but most of the rapidly expanding NFT market is speculative. Since it is highly vulnerable and traded in cryptocurrencies, there are some issues such as barriers to entry for fans who want to enjoy digital content provided by IP holders, and NFTs that are not licensed by IP holders. Will be done.  
  
A trust is an NFT business platform that uses blockchain technology to grant certificates to digital content and give it authenticity. By linking A trust with the next-generation copyright distribution system ""Asset Bank"" that centrally manages information such as copyrights of digital contents held by regular IP holders that started trial operation on April 13, IP We are building a system that allows fans to purchase legitimate digital content that is not infringed on copyrights in legal currency with peace of mind and ease.  
  
Enjin issues and manages NFTs such as ""Enjin Platform"" that makes it easy to issue NFTs, ""Enjin Wallet"" that enables seamless management of NFTs and cryptocurrencies, and ""Enjin Marketplace"" that allows NFT transactions. We are developing an ecosystem that uses blockchain technology that can be traded. NFTs on Enjin's ecosystem are managed by public blockchains, where users around the world trade primarily in cryptocurrencies.  
  
By linking A trust with the Enjin Platform, digital content (NFT), which is mainly used in A trust's economic zone, can be transferred to the Enjin ecosystem, and users all over the world can use it. It will be possible to expand to the market you are using. Specifically, A trust's digital content will be managed by Enjin Wallet and will be available for sale on the Enjin Marketplace.  
  
In the future, Enjin, the world leader in platforms using blockchain technology, will hold various discussions, assuming a future in which NFTs will be used throughout entertainment.""",gy220o8,2021-05-14 02:55:23,NEOPIXEL_TOKYO,[],/r/NFT/comments/nbtwf5/enjin_partners_with_one_of_japans_largest/gy220o8/,2,0,,2,0,nbtwf5,comment

NFT,Do you think films can become an NFT?,"Hi there. I'm new to the entire crypto industry after I discovered the boom of NFTs and crypto games among some of my friend groups. So while they encourage me to invest, I want to do my due diligence and conduct some research myself. As a film enthusiast, I want to check if the industry has active involvement in terms of crypto, and so far I've only encountered [Mogul Productions](https://www.mogulproductions.com/stars) (tl;dr they want to decentralize film production).

I wanted to get the POV of a crypto/blockchain investor regarding something that came to my head: can a film become an NFT? With nyan cat gifs and other artworks becoming tradable as NFTs, wouldn't it make sense for a film to become an NFT? I'm curious whether this prospect can be profitable in the future (because if so, I'm curious about investing in these given my interest haha) or why not.

So ... the potato person here has just as much right to be minted as other artwork. However, rarible and opensea really need to work on their categorization and sorting.

NFT,,"NFTs are cryptocurrency tokens, just like meme coins etc, they have an established supply and can be used to verify ownership for membership to online communities, gaming worlds and all kinds of digital asset markets. NFTs are currencies of the metaverse.

Investing in NFT art is speculative, just like actual physical art, and the market decides what it's ultimately worth in dollars by how much any one person is willing to pay for it.

The NFT market is just getting started, and there has already been enormous success for many artists and projects, but it really depends on the collection and community. For example, if you buy an AURORY NFT, then you have access to a new blockchain game currently in development, including its expansion world over time, characters, items and an entire in-game metaverse marketplace for assets etc.

Many individual artists and anyone really, can mint an NFT, but few will succeed in doing all the other follow through things that build and sustain value for the investors, collectors, holders etc.

If you want get invested in NFTs, look for really good art and/or really good communities and projects. Not all NFT collections have communities and can still have tremendous value if the art is good and people want to own a limited edition of something. Remember, in the metaverse, millions of people will be decorating their homes, clothing and other places with art; NFT art.

I collect NFTs and make good money doing it. I also buy NFTs because I love the artwork, and/or want to support the artist or team in continuing to create more.",hk9y0lw,2021-11-12 01:17:43,IndependenceGlum4141,[],/r/NFT/comments/qrs4kj/public_mint_for_cultists_opens_today_100/hk9y0lw/,15,0,,15,0,qrs4kj,comment

Some NFTs can and do serve an actual purpose of utility, but just like most cryptos, are valued purely via speculation rather than actual utility and demand. Therefore, only some NFT projects will be highly successful over time, and many will not.

Just like physical artwork, most of it ends up in thrift shops or as gifts for friends and family, even some really great quality art, whereas a very small amount of actual physical art retains and/or increases in value overtime.

First, if somebody tries to sell an exact copy of the NFT that I own you could sue the person, and actually, it is much easier than an actual painting, because of the blockchain tech behind it that verifies any transaction.

Finally, no, you proved my point because your initial argument was that ""With actual art, only the owner owns it"", which you deny that premise by saying that copies of the Mona lisa were sold for millions...",hkdhlb6,2021-11-12 20:18:14,franciscodbp,[],/r/NFT/comments/qrs4kj/public_mint_for_cultists_opens_today_100/hkdhlb6/,2,0,,2,0,qrs4kj,comment

French Connection Finance – $FCF – Has released its first NFT collection | Win up to $20,000 USD if you mint “Gotti the Don” | Or win $2,500 USD by minting a Legendary NFT! | Male and Female NFT MATING | Metaverse Art Gallery to display NFT collection!","FCF has released its first NFT collection 2 days ago! over 25% ALREADY MINTED!  This collection consists of 2,000 French Bulldogs with various attributes and rarities, rightfully named the FrenchFellas.

The islandboys made a video about the collection, Tyrone TOO! Much more celebs are getting on board.

You can breed male+Females and get baby NFTs!

Nine prizes of $2,500 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints a Legendary NFT. A grand prize of $10,000 USD will be automatically sent to anyone who mints the infamous “Gotti the Don”!

With over 12,000 FCF holders and only 2,000 NFTs, there will be a high demand and low supply, ensuring that these unique NFTs will be trading high on OpenSea.

Only 100 of this first collection will be female Frenchies. Procuring a female Frenchie will allow you to breed with a male Frenchie, thereby giving you the opportunity to mint more FrenchFellas when the second collection drops!

One lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive an airdropped Legendary NFT & $2,500 USD at 25% MINT!

A further lucky holder, chosen at random, will receive $20,000 USD when minting ends!

2 plost of land in the metaverse are going to be purchased by the DEV and turned into an art gallery and club to display and sell your beautiful NFT collection!

Part of the proceeds of this project will be donated to a French Bulldog animal shelter.

Portion allows anyone to be a collector. For the first time, manage your physical and digital collection in one place. Easily exchange crypto for art & collectibles on the Portion App!

The 21st Century Auction House for Rare, High-End NFT Art, Music and Collectibles!

✨ ***The Team***\*:\*

The Portion Team consists of 20 contributors and advisors, ranging from (previously) high-positioned members of Christies, Sotheby, HighSnobiety, JPMorgan Chase, Sirin Labs and many more (art and technology) institutions.

So it is safe to say that all of the team members have vast experience in the blockchain space as well as in the art industry. Furthermore, by actively recruiting fashion and technology experts and forming powerful partnerships with well-known brands and artists, the team is more than capable of building the global luxury marketplace as they envisioned from the start.

***🚀 Market and Target Audience***:

Portion has an ambitious business model concept when it comes to the world of NFTs. Its main goal is to bridge the gap between two striving economic systems. For one you have the new and much talked about NFT projects popping up everywhere and on the other side you have the growing digitalization of the auction industry. In order to bridge the gap, Portion describes itself as “*the premier online marketplace connecting artists and collectors through blockchain technology*”. So far there hasn’t been any real differentiation of other NFT platforms, but if you look closer they have a distinct target audience, namely luxury art collectors and artists bidding and trading on a global Marketplace. An audience that pushed Christies’ yearly revenue beyond the ***$4 Billion Dollar mark***, while also pushing the evaluation of the art and collectibles economy to about $2,7 Trillion in Assets and increasing online sales by 262% racking up over $300 million in the year of 2020.

👀 ***Benefits & Updates***:

\- Yesterday on the 06/05/2021 a Portion piece got shared on **Mark Cubans** NFT page.

\- **Marvel** & **DC** Artists are involved and minting NFT's on Portion App.

\- Partnership with **Simplex**

\- Website app is fully functional with minimal to no latency.

\- New Portion Tokens are distributed when artists create new NFT’s, currently 500 PRT each.

\- A super open and reliable team, very vocal and no rug potential at all.

\- 40% Token supply to be burned June 1st 2021 🔥

\- Easy 5x-10x potential!

NFT,DUSTYBOTS🤖 Best upcoming NFT Launch on Saturday 28.08?🔥,"Saturday is the launch of one of the most promising NFT projects I've seen in a long time - DUSTYBOTS!🤖

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n2ioooq0bdj71.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc286b0aaca17a3a767d8e17de754583d3b6c2ac

Dustybots is an unique collectible NFT Collection, consisting of small digital art toy robots. Instead of a normal head, they have a small screen showing short characteristic animations, which can also be used for promotions!🔥 They will launch on Rarible/Opensea - based on ETH.

&#x200B;

Dustybots is aiming to build an whole Ecosystem - after their Main Project Launch on SATURDAY 28.08, they are providing an Secret Sub-Project 2 Weeks after Launch, a Dusty-Coin in Q4 of 2021 and much more on their Roadmap like:

&#x200B;

\- Community driven Collection

\- Multiple Collaboration Colletions

\- Weekly Dustybot releases

\- Secret Sub-Project 2 weeks after Launch \~

\- Dustycoin

\- Exclusive Rewards for Dustybots Owners (Merch, BTS Insights, Presales, Golden Holder Rank with exclusive Channel etc.)

\- Membership Event & Offline Exhibiton (if Covid cools down 2022)

\- Dustybots Jewelry

\- Dustybots Pizza Store

&#x200B;

This all sounds pretty lit and they have a high professional Team, which already launched a funny Arcade Minigame!🔥

NFT,,"hi Reddit, 

I've been working on a set of 10 images that represent the most popular cryptocurrencies while also being a unique prime number. Each image has the following properties: 

* The prime has 2008 digits, the year the Bitcoin paper was published

New collaboration Major Grom: Plague Doctor (movie) x NFT Bastards  
  
110 artists from our community NFT Bastards with the creators of the world-famous movie Major Grom: Plague Doctor have released a collection on Binance NFT. The collaboration was presented in Moscow on December 18-19 at the Bubble Comics Con, a festival of geek culture.  
  
The collection is dedicated to the main antagonist of the film, the Plague Doctor. An ambiguous, multipolar interpretation of his ideas and actions, both in the body of the film's plot and among real moviegoers is a field for discussion and comprehension of the current images of ""good"" and ""evil"" through the prism of contemporary digital art.",hpt8ien,2021-12-24 14:39:44,Verse_E,[],/r/NFT/comments/rnnllv/illuminaty_collaboration_of_major_grom_plague/hpt8ien/,2,0,,2,0,rnnllv,comment

NFT,,"We are just about to cross the 100ETH total volume on OS and wanted to celebrate by releasing a new highlight video!  
  
We have created 6,000 avatars based on a philosophical Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has 6,000 unique responses to 6,000 questions. Your AiVATAR will be uniquely yours, and the response is generative, which means you’re not sure what it’s gonna say until we clicked GO and began the minting process. I sure hope your AiVATAR won’t say anything too offensive or upsetting or mentions killing humans, but, in our tests so far, a few of them do. All responses are generated by the AI.

NFT,NFT Ticketing will hype up the future of the ticketing industry,"NFT art is just scratching the surface because NFTs are much more than just jpegs. They are rights to ownership. Having tokens that have their uniqueness guaranteed through blockchain opens many possibilities.  


When NFTs expanded to the music industry as NFT Tickets it was expected that it would provide a special experience for the artist and fans in the digital world. NFT tickets can’t be destroyed and with their unique nature they can be easily showcased and shared with others on the internet. It also solved the problem of transparency as it is recorded in the blockchain. People in the secondary market can no longer rip off fans with a fake ticket and enable fair distribution of tickets.  NFTs can also give artists a new voice and help them connect with their fan communities. To implement this, we can choose from the different platforms like [Centaurify](http://www.centaurify.com/?r=1), [Get Protocol ](https://www.get-protocol.io/)or [Seatlab](https://seatlabnft.com/) for ticket minting and market functions.  


NFTs have now become a market-expanding technology. Even the entrepreneurs started to envision a future where every ticket is an NFT. For example, the Dallas Mavericks, owned by [Mark Cuban](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-mark-cuban-wants-turn-151934328.html), decided to issue 20,000 NFTs for every home game. Fans were allowed to trade their NFTs, with sales ranging from $200 to $10,000. Also the Monumental Sports and Entertainment CEO - [Ted Leonsis](https://www.sportico.com/business/tech/2021/ted-leonsis-blockchain-ticketing-1234624872/) sees a blockchain future in ticketing.

NFTs are here to stay. As time passes, every industry and brand will have an NFT strategy to tap into global audiences.",sve836,2022-02-18 09:52:22,Ornery-Eye-6470,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",/r/NFT/comments/sve836/nft_ticketing_will_hype_up_the_future_of_the/,134,0,59,134,0,sve836,post

NFT,,"Unfortunately NFTs don't solve a lot of the problems mentioned:

* The spot on the blockchain is unique, what it points to isn't. The same ticket can be minted multiple times.

* Fake tickets will still exist, with the aforementioned fraudulently minted copies. All it takes to fall for a scam is to not check who minted the ticket.

* You can't ensure fair distributions as you can't verify who owns which wallet. Scalper with 1000 accounts, can buy 1000 tickets.

It's also neither feasible nor necessary to verify the owner with absolute certainty at the entrance. 1. Not enough time. 2. Much easier to sort problems out should people fight over a seat.",hxgozd2,2022-02-18 16:33:05,BetaKeyTakeaway,[],/r/NFT/comments/sve836/nft_ticketing_will_hype_up_the_future_of_the/hxgozd2/,4,0,,4,0,sve836,comment
NFT,,"So uhm ... How exactly are they more secure than a ticket distributed by a centralised authority? Especially seeing as that authority requires that you're validated as a real person. NFT tickets will just open the floodgates for scalpers of all sorts, and with everyone being able to open as many wallets as they want, the issuer of tickets will have to verify wallets before sale, making them essentially just the same process with extra steps.

Besides, with NFT's being a more complex technology than just sending a PDF with a QR code on it, it'll open the floodgates for more scams, not less. More complexity is more loopholes and more suckers being taken advantage of.

Also - Mark Cuban is a verified NFT scam artist, so wherever he goes is where the greater potential for scams are. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xkgoRkC3pc&feature=emb_title

There might be niche use cases for NFT's, but unless you can provide a really solid argument for how they beat the normal system without opening the door for all sorts of abuses, I don't think this is it, chief. And again, dont trust Mark Cuban.",hxflu68,2022-02-18 11:15:16,Ankerjorgensen,[],/r/NFT/comments/sve836/nft_ticketing_will_hype_up_the_future_of_the/hxflu68/,10,0,,10,0,sve836,comment

There is enough variety for over 3 million combinations, and we are only minting 10k on the BSC. and just to make things easier for everyone, you buy a pack of up to five, and you get a discount compared to stamping one at a time.

NFT,,"This is a new NFT headed by /u/Shonduras, also behind Spacestation gaming!!

SSA (Spacestation Animation) is a YouTube focused animation studio founded in 2020 with over 15 full time artists, animators, and storytellers. Their first project has been in development for over a year and is set to launch Episode 1 in 2021.

Coinciding with this launch is their launch of the QuarterMachine NFT!

Certain Quarter Machine NFTs appear in Episode 1 of Spacestation Animation’s YouTube series. They plan on utilizing NFTs from this collection in future episodes as well.

If your NFT is one of the lucky ones to appear in Episode 1 (or future episodes!) on the Spacestation Animation channel, you will receive licensing rewards for that specific episode.

NFT,,"There are almost 800,000 accounts right now on Wax and its growing fast. Whats the value of being on the most popular platforms that are gate keeping amd keeping alot of the artist who wish to participate from even being able to because of the fees? You also wont see $1 NFTs on amy Ethereum based platform because it costs $50 in fees to do that transaction right now. Until layer 2 solutions are fully implemented and evem after other blockchains will have attractive utility for certain applications. Theres also is nothing that stops one from having Higher end Art on an expensive platform and the community building, promo and utility NFTs on lower cost platforms like wax. For example having a monthly subscription NFT that gives access to exclusive rewards or drops to those who hold that NFT theres so many possibilities. This is also the difference between selling your product on Amazon or having your own website one option comes full of limits amd they control everything such as your audience in exchange for more traffic but they can also at any time pull the rug from under you and thats not what Crypto is supposed to be about. I do see Ethereum based platforms as being the main platforms but there is space for others and the uber gatekeeping of the art world is due for disruption, not more of the same gatekeeping with a crypto title exchanging one middleman for another and defeating the entire purpose of the blockchain in many ways.",gr8bqcw,2021-03-17 12:42:00,thundergoose2020,[],/r/NFT/comments/m6qw6j/i_paid_137_in_gas_fees_and_all_i_got_was_this/gr8bqcw/,5,0,,5,0,m6qw6j,comment
